To\nempirically explore this distinction, the research analyzes metadata from 157\nYouTube videos discussing AI. Conducting a thematic analysis combining\nqualitative insights with keyword-based quantitative metrics, this\nmixed-methods approach uncovers recurring themes in public discourse, including\nprivacy, job displacement, misinformation, optimism, and ethical concerns. The\nresults reveal a dual sentiment: public fascination with AI's capabilities\ncoexists with anxiety and skepticism about its societal implications. The\ndiscussion critiques the orthogonality thesis, which posits that intelligence\nis separable from goal content, and instead argues that human intelligence\nintegrates goal-setting and goal-pursuit. It underscores the centrality of\nembodied cognition in human reasoning and highlights how AI's limitations come\nfrom its current reliance on computational processing. The study advocates for\nenhancing emotional and digital literacy to foster responsible AI engagement.\nIt calls for reframing public discourse to recognize AI as a tool that augments\n-- rather than replaces -- human intelligence. By positioning problem seeking\nat the core of cognition and as a critical dimension of intelligence, this\nresearch offers new perspectives on ethically aligned and human-centered AI\ndevelopment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u5bfb\u627e\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u548cAI\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9AI\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u4e0eAI\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5b9a\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9157\u4e2aYouTube\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9AI\u65e2\u7740\u8ff7\u53c8\u7126\u8651\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e3b\u9898\u5305\u62ec\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u5931\u4e1a\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u5f20\u589e\u5f3a\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Most existing deep learning-based drug repositioning methods\npredominantly utilize graph-based representations. However, graph-based drug\nrepositioning methods struggle to perform effective inference in cold-start\nscenarios involving novel drugs because of the lack of association information\nwith the diseases. Unlike traditional graph-based approaches, we propose a\nbidirectional behavior learning strategy for drug repositioning, known as\nBiBLDR. This innovative framework redefines drug repositioning as a behavior\nsequential learning task to capture drug-disease interaction patterns. First,\nwe construct bidirectional behavioral sequences based on drug and disease\nsides. The consideration of bidirectional information ensures a more meticulous\nand rigorous characterization of the behavioral sequences. Subsequently, we\npropose a two-stage strategy for drug repositioning. In the first stage, we\nconstruct prototype spaces to characterize the representational attributes of\ndrugs and diseases. In the second stage, these refined prototypes and\nbidirectional behavior sequence data are leveraged to predict potential\ndrug-disease associations. Based on this learning approach, the model can more\nrobustly and precisely capture the interactive relationships between drug and\ndisease features from bidirectional behavioral sequences. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark\ndatasets.

In this work, we propose a suite of traffic tasks in\nautonomous driving where vehicles in a traffic scenario need to communicate in\nnatural language to facilitate coordination in order to avoid an imminent\ncollision and/or support efficient traffic flow. To this end, this paper\nintroduces a novel method, LLM+Debrief, to learn a message generation and\nhigh-level decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles through multi-agent\ndiscussion. To evaluate LLM agents for driving, we developed a gym-like\nsimulation environment that contains a range of driving scenarios. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that LLM+Debrief is more effective at\ngenerating meaningful and human-understandable natural language messages to\nfacilitate cooperation and coordination than a zero-shot LLM agent.

A\ncritical aspect of human learning is continuous interaction with the\nenvironment -- not limited to language, but also involving multimodal\nunderstanding and generation. To move closer to human-level intelligence,\nmodels must similarly support multi-turn, multimodal interaction. In\nparticular, they should comprehend interleaved multimodal contexts and respond\ncoherently in ongoing exchanges. In this work, we present an initial\nexploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn\nmultimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration,\nwe particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert\nannotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack\nsuch complex interactive capabilities. InterMT captures human preferences at\nboth global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k\nprompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled\npreference pairs. To compensate for the lack of capability for multi-modal\nunderstanding and generation, we introduce an agentic workflow that leverages\ntool-augmented MLLMs to construct multi-turn QA instances. To further this\ngoal, we introduce InterMT-Bench to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting\njudges with multi-turn, multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the utility of\n\\InterMT through applications such as judge moderation and further reveal the\nmulti-turn scaling law of judge model.

MSQA represents the\nfirst benchmark to jointly evaluate the factual and reasoning capabilities of\nLLMs crucial for LLMs in advanced materials science.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSQA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,757\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6c34\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e13\u6709LLMs\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9aLLMs\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cMSQA\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "MSQA\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u8be6\u7ec6\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u5224\u65ad\uff09\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e03\u4e2a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u6709LLMs\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe84.5%\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u7ea660.5%\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9aLLMs\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "MSQA\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We argue that such systems have\npreviously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin\ndescriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and\ntherefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.\nBy contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have\ndeveloped frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal\nrepresentations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual\ninformation needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can\neffectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the\nverbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)\nautomating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially\novercoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human\nmeaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about\ndeveloping new representational formats (based on thick description).

Point clouds are captured by diverse\nsensors (e.g., depth cameras, LiDAR) across varied domains (e.g., indoor,\noutdoor), each introducing unique scanning patterns, sampling densities, and\nsemantic biases.

While post-training pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda can\neffectively reduce the model size, but struggle to maintain model performance\nat high sparsity levels, limiting their utility for downstream tasks. Existing\nfine-tuning methods, such as full fine-tuning and LoRA, fail to preserve\nsparsity as they require updating the whole dense metrics, not well-suited for\nsparse LLMs. In this paper, we propose Sparsity Evolution Fine-Tuning (SEFT), a\nnovel method designed specifically for sparse LLMs. SEFT dynamically evolves\nthe sparse topology of pruned models during fine-tuning, while preserving the\noverall sparsity throughout the process.

Furthermore, a sensitivity-driven pruning\ncriterion is employed to ensure that the desired sparsity level is consistently\nmaintained throughout fine-tuning.

However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data,\nparticularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet,\nsignificantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is\ntraditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice\nthickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of\nkilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning\nframework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice\nthickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic\nloss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography,\nBedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass\nconservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate\nhigh-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively\nadjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in\nareas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution\nof BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates.

While\nconstructing the dataset to pretrain a large target LLM, we directly apply the\nactor, which is trained with a small proxy LLM as the environment, as the\nsampling strategy. The transfer of sampling strategy can not only ensure the\nefficiency of dynamical data mixing, but also expedite the convergence of\npretraining the target LLM. Numerical results demonstrate that AC-ODM-410M,\nwhich invokes the sampling strategy obtained by a proxy LLM with 410M\nparameters, reaching the optimal validation perplexity of ODM 71% faster, and\nimproves performance on the zero-shot MMLU benchmark by 27.5% of accuracy,\nabout 2.23x better on pass@1 of HumanEval benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eactor-critic\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08AC-ODM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u57df\u6743\u91cd\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u57df\u5185\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ODM\uff09\u672a\u8003\u8651\u57df\u5185\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528actor-critic\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u6355\u83b7\u57df\u6743\u91cd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8003\u8651\u57df\u5185\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "AC-ODM-410M\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6bd4ODM\u5feb71%\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u96f6-shot MMLU\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534727.5%\uff0cHumanEval pass@1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad82.23\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AC-ODM\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Artificial\nintelligence approaches, such as deep learning, offer promising solutions for\nleveraging genomic and clinical data to predict disease outcomes. Objective:\nThis study aimed to develop a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model to predict\nCOVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and associated clinical\nmetadata from South American patients. Methods: We retrieved 9,570 spike\nprotein sequences from the GISAID database, of which 3,467 met inclusion\ncriteria after standardization. The dataset included 2,313 severe and 1,154\nmild cases. A feature engineering pipeline extracted features from sequences,\nwhile demographic and clinical variables were one-hot encoded. A hybrid\nCNN-LSTM architecture was trained, combining CNN layers for local pattern\nextraction and an LSTM layer for long-term dependency modeling. Results: The\nmodel achieved an F1 score of 82.92%, ROC-AUC of 0.9084, precision of 83.56%,\nand recall of 82.85%, demonstrating robust classification performance. Training\nstabilized at 85% accuracy with minimal overfitting.

A further challenge arises when models trained on one\nfield (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to\ndomain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition,\nand crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by\nenabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods\nstruggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading\nto misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy\nthrough multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features\nderived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our\nmethod captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities.\nThese gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature\nrepresentations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we\npropose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical,\nand stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the\nbroader spatial context for robust visual recognition.

This fast\nweight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past\ntokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show\neffectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on\nmodern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely\nlow FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online\nminibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,\na small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the\ndata, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or\nN-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the\nopposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to\n1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk\nTest-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of\nmagnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size\n(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,\nall without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It\nalso allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online\nupdates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks,\nincluding novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and\nauto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR\nvideo diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence\nexperiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length.

In this work, we systematically investigate the\ndynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc\n1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self\nReference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a\nwarm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start\nRL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly\ndifficult.

It remains effective even when the teacher is trained on a\nmuch simpler dataset and is $25 \\times$ smaller than the student. In a\nlarge-scale study of over 400 teacher-student pairs, we show that three\ninterpretable and computable properties of the teacher's representations (i.e.,\ntask relevance, behavioral relevance, and complementary knowledge) explain up\nto 85% of the variance in transfer success. These insights offer practical\nguidance for teacher selection and design.

To\nthis end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning\nalgorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI\nmultimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy\nto seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from\nperspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder.\nThis representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and\nenables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space.

We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models\nacross five datasets and six downstream tasks.

Furthermore,\nwe analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship\nbetween patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a\npreliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay\nthe groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable\ndeployment of pathology foundation models.

Traditional uniform sampling often leads to\nselection of irrelevant content, while post-training MLLMs on thousands of\nframes imposes a substantial computational burden. In this paper, we propose\nthreading keyframes with narratives (Nar-KFC), a plug-and-play module to\nfacilitate effective and efficient long video perception. Nar-KFC generally\ninvolves two collaborative steps. First, we formulate the keyframe selection\nprocess as an integer quadratic programming problem, jointly optimizing\nquery-relevance and frame-diversity. To avoid its computational complexity, a\ncustomized greedy search strategy is designed as an efficient alternative.\nSecond, to mitigate the temporal discontinuity caused by sparse keyframe\nsampling, we further introduce interleaved textual narratives generated from\nnon-keyframes using off-the-shelf captioners. These narratives are inserted\nbetween keyframes based on their true temporal order, forming a coherent and\ncompact representation. Nar-KFC thus serves as a temporal- and content-aware\ncompression strategy that complements visual and textual modalities.\nExperimental results on multiple long-video benchmarks demonstrate that Nar-KFC\nsignificantly improves the performance of popular MLLMs. Code will be made\npublicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNar-KFC\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u53d9\u4e8b\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u8fc7\u591a\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u8fc7\u591a\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5e27\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNar-KFC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Nar-KFC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u3002"}}

To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.\n(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not\nsubstantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale\nduring training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when\ntraining GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a\nproxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be\ntrusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a\nsimple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS\nevolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that\nCBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus\nas training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across\ndifferent model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can\ninform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over\ntraining motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language\nmodels at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the\nCBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to\nslightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient\nsteps.

In addition, we\nincorporate a history-aware routing mechanism that leverages long-term\ntrajectory data to enhance expert selection and ensure prediction stability.\nEmpirical evaluations across several real-world urban datasets show that\nNextLocMoE achieves superior performance in terms of predictive accuracy,\ncross-domain generalization, and interpretability", "AI": {"tldr": "NextLocMoE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21Mixture-of-Experts\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4f4d\u7f6e\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "NextLocMoE\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21MoE\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5d4c\u5165\u7ea7\u522b\u7684Location Semantics MoE\u548cTransformer\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u7684Personalized MoE\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNextLocMoE\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "NextLocMoE\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21MoE\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper\nintroduces Self-Improved Privilege Learning (SIPL), a novel paradigm that\novercomes these limitations by innovatively extending the utility of privileged\ninformation (PI) beyond training into the inference stage. Unlike conventional\nPrivilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded\nafter training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs\nas pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time.\nCentral to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable\nPrivileged Dictionary.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIPL\nsignificantly advances the state-of-the-art on diverse all-in-one image\nrestoration benchmarks.

Because high-quality generations with\nDMs typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs), resulting\nin slow sampling, there has been extensive research successfully reducing the\nNFE to a small range (<10) while maintaining acceptable image quality. However,\nmany practical applications, such as those involving Stable Diffusion 3.5,\nFLUX, and SANA, commonly operate in the mid-NFE regime (20-50 NFE) to achieve\nsuperior results, and, despite the practical relevance, research on the\neffective sampling within this mid-NFE regime remains underexplored.

In a perfect world,\ntraining algorithms would not require workload-specific hyperparameter tuning,\nbut would instead have default settings that performed well across many\nworkloads.

Given these developments, how\nfar away is the dream of neural network training algorithms that completely\nobviate the need for painful tuning?\n  In this paper, we evaluate the potential of learning-rate-free methods as\ncomponents of hyperparameter-free methods. We freeze their (non-learning rate)\nhyperparameters to default values, and score their performance using the\nrecently-proposed AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. We found that\nliterature-supplied default settings performed poorly on the benchmark, so we\nperformed a search for hyperparameter configurations that performed well across\nall workloads simultaneously. The best AlgoPerf-calibrated learning-rate-free\nmethods had much improved performance but still lagged slightly behind a\nsimilarly calibrated NadamW baseline in overall benchmark score.

We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled,\ndiagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack -\nwith hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade\ninductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning\ncounterparts.\n  To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how\nreasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect\nsub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer\nsummarization.

To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection\ntask using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high\ninter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,\nfatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle\ndifferences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves\na mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection\n(59.30$\\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\\pm$11.39%).

However, the success of GNNs relies on abundant labeled data, while\nobtaining high-quality labels is costly and challenging, especially for newly\nemerging domains. Hence, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which trains a\nclassifier on the labeled source graph and adapts it to the unlabeled target\ngraph, is attracting increasing attention. Various approaches have been\nproposed to alleviate the distribution shift between the source and target\ngraphs to facilitate the classifier adaptation. However, most of them simply\nadopt existing UDA techniques developed for independent and identically\ndistributed data to gain domain-invariant node embeddings for graphs, which do\nnot fully consider the graph structure and message-passing mechanism of GNNs\nduring the adaptation and will fail when label distribution shift exists among\ndomains.

To\ninvestigate this we opted to train the models using a total of 4,500 seconds of\naudio samples, evenly distributed across a 9-class dataset. We leveraged\nparameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and data augmentations to mitigate the\ndata scarcity. This paper implements and compares the use of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) and attention-based transformers. Our results show that,\nCNNs outperform transformers by 1-2\\% accuracy, while still being more\ncomputationally efficient. These early findings, however, point to potential in\nusing transformers models; suggesting that with more data and further\noptimizations they could outperform CNNs.

Moving beyond specialized evaluation tasks, we propose an\ninformation-theoretic framework grounded in mutual information (MI) to achieve\nthis. We formalize the understanding as MI between an input sentence and its\nlatent representation (sentence-level MI), measuring how effectively input\ninformation is preserved in latent representation. Given that LLMs learn\nembeddings for individual tokens, we decompose sentence-level MI into\ntoken-level MI between tokens and sentence embeddings, establishing theoretical\nbounds connecting these measures.

In this paper, we first propose\na novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network\n(STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the\nnon-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a\nsparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by\nnon-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness.\nDifferent from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which\nall regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the\nadvantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and\nsuccessfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings.

However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG\nsystems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to\nperform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to\naddress these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To\naddress these limitations, we propose $\\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses\n$\\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to\n$\\textbf{R}$eason and $\\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving\ncomprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is\ndivided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the\nmanner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval.

In\nthis study, we focus on evaluating and mitigating social bias on both the\nmodel's response and probability distribution. To do so, we first evaluate four\nstate-of-the-art VLMs on PAIRS and SocialCounterfactuals datasets with the\nmultiple-choice selection task. Surprisingly, we find that models suffer from\ngenerating gender-biased or race-biased responses. We also observe that models\nare prone to stating their responses are fair, but indeed having mis-calibrated\nconfidence levels towards particular social groups. While investigating why\nVLMs are unfair in this study, we observe that VLMs' hidden layers exhibit\nsubstantial fluctuations in fairness levels. Meanwhile, residuals in each layer\nshow mixed effects on fairness, with some contributing positively while some\nlead to increased bias.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose FedDEA (Federated Decoupled Aggregation), an\nupdate-structure-aware aggregation method specifically designed for multi-task\nmodel integration. Our method dynamically identifies task-relevant dimensions\nbased on the response strength of local updates and enhances their optimization\neffectiveness through rescaling. This mechanism effectively suppresses\ncross-task interference and enables task-level decoupled aggregation within a\nunified global model. FedDEA does not rely on task labels or architectural\nmodifications, making it broadly applicable and deployment-friendly.\nExperimental results demonstrate that it can be easily integrated into various\nmainstream federated optimization algorithms and consistently delivers\nsignificant overall performance improvements on widely used NYUD-V2 and\nPASCAL-Context. These results validate the robustness and generalization\ncapabilities of FedDEA under highly heterogeneous task settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedDEA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u89e3\u8026\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedDEA\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5f3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u89e3\u8026\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedDEA\u80fd\u8f7b\u677e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e3b\u6d41\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728NYUD-V2\u548cPASCAL-Context\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FedDEA\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002"}}

Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses\nmore formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging\ndistance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2)\ncomplex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and\nhighly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in\nsubstantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it\ndifficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features,\nthereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in\nreal-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nfine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial\nperception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire\nrows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and\ninterpretability.

To this end, we propose a\nsimple and efficient long-sequence event Re-ID model, namely the Spike-guided\nSpatiotemporal Semantic Coupling and Expansion Network (S3CE-Net). To better\nhandle asynchronous event data, we build S3CE-Net based on spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs). The S3CE-Net incorporates the Spike-guided Spatial-temporal\nAttention Mechanism (SSAM) and the Spatiotemporal Feature Sampling Strategy\n(STFS). The SSAM is designed to carry out semantic interaction and association\nin both spatial and temporal dimensions, leveraging the capabilities of SNNs.\nThe STFS involves sampling spatial feature subsequences and temporal feature\nsubsequences from the spatiotemporal dimensions, driving the Re-ID model to\nperceive broader and more robust effective semantics.

When applied to Adam (termed\nAdamPower), GradPower consistently achieves lower terminal loss across diverse\narchitectures (LLaMA, Qwen2MoE), parameter scales (66M to 2B), datasets (C4,\nOpenWebText), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). The\nmost pronounced gains are observed when training modern mixture-of-experts\nmodels with warmup-stable-decay schedules. GradPower also integrates seamlessly\nwith other state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Muon, yielding further\nimprovements.

The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading\nthe performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel\nframework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the\ncontext of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that\nexisting open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers\nand outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be\neasily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance\ndegradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In\ncontrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models\nthat are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging\nthe discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables\nrobust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified.

Effective RL for LLMs\nrequires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient\ntraining systems.

However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing\nthe core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration,\ndifferential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we\nintroduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic\nmanipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity\nand complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by\ncomparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic\n`perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance\nfor all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized\npatterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models\nachieving high baseline accuracy.

In this work, we theoretically investigate the emergence of W2SG\nthrough a generalized bias-variance decomposition of Bregman divergence.\nSpecifically, we show that the expected population risk gap between the student\nand teacher is quantified by the expected misfit between the two models.

Using a concrete example, we demonstrate that\nif the student model has significantly larger capacity than the teacher, it can\nindeed converge to this posterior mean.

However, recent\nworks indicate that CLIP falls short in distinguishing detailed differences in\nimages and shows suboptimal performance on dense-prediction and vision-centric\nmultimodal tasks. Therefore, this work focuses on improving existing CLIP\nmodels, aiming to capture as many visual details in images as possible. We find\nthat a specific type of generative models, unCLIP, provides a suitable\nframework for achieving our goal. Specifically, unCLIP trains an image\ngenerator conditioned on the CLIP image embedding. In other words, it inverts\nthe CLIP image encoder. Compared to discriminative models like CLIP, generative\nmodels are better at capturing image details because they are trained to learn\nthe data distribution of images. Additionally, the conditional input space of\nunCLIP aligns with CLIP's original image-text embedding space. Therefore, we\npropose to invert unCLIP (dubbed un$^2$CLIP) to improve the CLIP model. In this\nway, the improved image encoder can gain unCLIP's visual detail capturing\nability while preserving its alignment with the original text encoder\nsimultaneously.

This\nstudy provides a rigorous, interdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and\noffers critical insights into their role in attaining sustainability goals. Our\nfindings show: (1) While not universally superior, FMs often outperform\ntraditional approaches across diverse tasks and datasets. (2) Evaluating FMs\nshould go beyond accuracy to include transferability, generalization, and\nenergy efficiency as key criteria for their responsible use. (3) FMs enable\nscalable, SDG-grounded solutions, offering broad utility for tackling complex\nsustainability challenges. Critically, we advocate for a paradigm shift from\nmodel-centric development to impact-driven deployment, and emphasize metrics\nsuch as energy efficiency, robustness to domain shifts, and ethical\nconsiderations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SustainFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e17\u4e2a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FMs\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0FMs\u5728\u591a\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FMs\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5168\u7403\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SustainFM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d22\u5bcc\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u73af\u5883\u707e\u5bb3\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u5bf9FMs\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "FMs\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u5305\u62ec\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002FMs\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u547c\u5401\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6c\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u3002"}}

This extension enables the network to\ndifferentially weight neighbouring pixels based on their relative position to\nthe reference pixel, improving spatial characterisation and feature extraction.\nThe proposed operator maintains the same number of trainable parameters and is\nfully compatible with existing CNN architectures. Although developed for 2D\nimage data, the framework is generalisable to signals on regular grids of\narbitrary dimensions, such as 3D volumetric data or 1D time series. We propose\nan efficient implementation of the weighted convolution by pre-computing the\ndensity function and achieving execution times comparable to standard\nconvolution layers. We evaluate our method on two deep learning tasks: image\nclassification using the CIFAR-100 dataset [KH+09] and image denoising using\nthe DIV2K dataset [AT17]. Experimental results with state-of-the-art\nclassification (e.g., VGG [SZ15], ResNet [HZRS16]) and denoising (e.g., DnCNN\n[ZZC+17], NAFNet [CCZS22]) methods show that the weighted convolution improves\nperformance with respect to standard convolution across different quantitative\nmetrics.

Traditional semi-supervised segmentation and unsupervised\ndomain adaptation methods address one of these issues separately. However, the\ncoexistence of limited annotation and domain shift is quite common, which\nmotivates us to introduce a novel and challenging scenario: Mixed Domain\nSemi-supervised medical image Segmentation (MiDSS), where limited labeled data\nfrom a single domain and a large amount of unlabeled data from multiple\ndomains. To tackle this issue, we propose the UST-RUN framework, which fully\nleverages intermediate domain information to facilitate knowledge transfer. We\nemploy Unified Copy-paste (UCP) to construct intermediate domains, and propose\na Symmetric GuiDance training strategy (SymGD) to supervise unlabeled data by\nmerging pseudo-labels from intermediate samples. Subsequently, we introduce a\nTraining Process aware Random Amplitude MixUp (TP-RAM) to progressively\nincorporate style-transition components into intermediate samples. To generate\nmore diverse intermediate samples, we further select reliable samples with\nhigh-quality pseudo-labels, which are then mixed with other unlabeled data.\nAdditionally, we generate sophisticated intermediate samples with high-quality\npseudo-labels for unreliable samples, ensuring effective knowledge transfer for\nthem.

When using single-modal data, the same input undergoes various\naugmentations before being fed into different branches. However, all existing\ncontrastive learning frameworks have so far only performed contrastive\noperations on the learned features at the final loss end, with no information\nexchange between different branches prior to this stage. In this paper, for\npoint cloud unsupervised learning without the use of extra training data, we\npropose a Contrastive Cross-branch Attention-based framework for Point cloud\ndata (termed PoCCA), to learn rich 3D point cloud representations. By\nintroducing sub-branches, PoCCA allows information exchange between different\nbranches before the loss end.

Verbalized confidence offers a\nmore efficient alternative, but existing approaches are largely limited to\nshort-form question answering (QA) tasks and do not generalize well to\nopen-ended generation. In this paper, we propose LoVeC (Long-form Verbalized\nConfidence), an on-the-fly verbalized confidence estimation method for\nlong-form generation.

The laborious\nand costly process of FACS coding has motivated the development of machine\nlearning frameworks for Action Unit (AU) detection. Despite intense efforts\nspanning three decades, the detection accuracy for many AUs is considered to be\nbelow the threshold needed for behavioral research. Also, many AUs are excluded\naltogether, making it impossible to fulfill the ultimate goal of FACS-the\nrepresentation of any facial expression in its entirety. This paper considers\nan alternative approach. Instead of creating automated tools that mimic FACS\nexperts, we propose to use a new coding system that mimics the key properties\nof FACS. Specifically, we construct a data-driven coding system called the\nFacial Basis, which contains units that correspond to localized and\ninterpretable 3D facial movements, and overcomes three structural limitations\nof automated FACS coding. First, the proposed method is completely\nunsupervised, bypassing costly, laborious and variable manual annotation.\nSecond, Facial Basis reconstructs all observable movement, rather than relying\non a limited repertoire of recognizable movements (as in automated FACS).\nFinally, the Facial Basis units are additive, whereas AUs may fail detection\nwhen they appear in a non-additive combination.

Although many studies focus on\nimproving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work\ntries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to\nimprove failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic\nof code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the\nsuccess of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity\nmetrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation\nwith LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic\nregression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of\ncode correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback\nmethod, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity\nmetrics from previous failed outputs.

In\nthis paper, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Granularity Image-Text Aligning\n(Hi-GITA) framework based on a contrastive paradigm. To leverage the abundant\nfine-grained semantic information of Chinese characters, we propose\nmulti-granularity encoders on both image and text sides.

The Text Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts stroke and\nradical sequence representations at different levels of granularity. To better\ncapture the relationships between strokes and radicals, we introduce\nMulti-Granularity Fusion Modules on the image and text sides, respectively.\nFurthermore, to effectively bridge the two modalities, we further introduce a\nFine-Grained Decoupled Image-Text Contrastive loss, which aligns image and text\nrepresentations across multiple granularities.

Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level\noptimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning\nthe distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested\noptimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a\npromising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean\nspace, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,\noverlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed\nHDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential\nvolume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like\nstructures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz\nhyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is\nmeasured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By\noptimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated\ninto the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards\nthe root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving\ntheir underlying geometric characteristics.

This study addresses these\nchallenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework\ntailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled (PL) target datasets.\nUnlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the proposed\nMOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously.\nFurthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures\napplicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based\ndesigns-for compound fault diagnosis under PL conditions. Based on this\ninvestigation, we propose a novel cross-talk layer structure that enables\nselective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing\nclassification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition,\nfrequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation\nperformance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented\nusing a motor-based test setup, and the proposed model was evaluated across six\ndomain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior\nmacro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the\nproposed mode's structural advantage is more pronounced in compound fault\nsettings through a single-fault comparison.

This adds substantial complexity to the\nproblem because not all players have the same action capacities, that is, only\nsome players are capable of basing their decisions on their opponent's\nmovements. However, the small sample sizes on the player level mean that one\nmay have limited insights into a specific opponent's capacities. We address\nthese challenges by developing a player-agnostic simulation framework that can\nevaluate the efficacy of different goalkeeper strategies. It considers a rich\nset of choices and incorporates information about a goalkeeper's skills. Our\nwork is grounded in a large dataset of penalties that were annotated by penalty\nexperts and include aspects of both kicker and goalkeeper strategies. We show\nhow our framework can be used to optimize goalkeeper policies in real-world\nsituations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7403\u5458\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5b88\u95e8\u5458\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5047\u8bbe\u5b88\u95e8\u5458\u548c\u7f5a\u7403\u8005\u72ec\u7acb\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5b88\u95e8\u5458\u548c\u7f5a\u7403\u8005\u72ec\u7acb\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u53cc\u65b9\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7403\u5458\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5b88\u95e8\u5458\u6280\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u70b9\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u5316\u5b88\u95e8\u5458\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u70b9\u7403\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b88\u95e8\u5458\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which\nmainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first\ntheoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a\nbias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error\nof each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which\nindicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing\nTransformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when\nindividual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain\nmutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when\nindividual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce\nan information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding\nlayers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e.,\nare diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of\nlayers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional\nlayers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the\nparameter scaling laws.

However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video\nediting, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and\nvisual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally\nexpensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in\nslow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a\nnovel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation\nthat text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the\npretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention\nlayers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the\nfirst stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos\nproduced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax\noptimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.\nSpecifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise (\"bad\nnoise\") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains\nthe model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging\nconditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object\nremoval results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG,\nsignificantly improving inference efficiency.

However, these\npre-trained models are prone to lack reasoning abilities and are difficult to\nadapt to new environments, further hindering their application to complex\nreal-world tasks. To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive\nprocess, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal\nmodel (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize\nstructured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting\"\nparadigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to\nextract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to\ninitialize a structured causal model of the environment. Subsequently,in the\nadapting stage, we update the structured causal model through external feedback\nabout the environment, via an idea of causal intervention. Finally, in the\nacting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more\nefficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above\nprocesses are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately\nenabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the\nenvironment and make more efficient decisions.

The healthcare sector has increasingly adopted AI for\ntasks such as clinical data analysis and medical code assignment.

Unlike\ntraditional code assignment, which is a one-to-one problem, clinical data\nsearch is a one-to-many problem, i.e., a given search query can map to a family\nof codes. Healthcare professionals typically search for groups of related\ndiseases, drugs, or conditions that map to many codes, and therefore, they need\nsearch tools that can handle keyword synonyms, semantic variants, and broad\nopen-ended queries. SearchAI employs a hierarchical model that respects the\ncoding hierarchy and improves the traversal of relationships from parent to\nchild nodes. SearchAI navigates these hierarchies predictively and ensures that\nall paths are reachable without losing any relevant nodes.\n  To evaluate the effectiveness of SearchAI, we conducted a series of\nexperiments using both public and production datasets.

In this way, model\nsensitivity to perturbations is reduced, and robustness is enhanced since\nmodels in the neighborhood of the flat minimum also enjoy low loss values.

This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the\nwall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers\nand preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding\nthe use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human\nexperimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$\nwere investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the\npolar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse\nForce Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall\ndisplacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local\nferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration.

In\nthis work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning\nas the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional\nprobability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other,\nconsistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal\nalgorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of\nthese conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is\nsimilar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.\n  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models.

The proliferation of MILP instance generation\nmethods, driven by machine learning's demand for diverse optimization datasets\nand the limitations of static benchmarks, has significantly outpaced\nstandardized evaluation techniques. Consequently, assessing the fidelity and\nutility of synthetic MILP instances remains a critical, multifaceted challenge.\nThis paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark framework designed for the\nsystematic and objective evaluation of MILP instance generation methods. Our\nframework provides a unified and extensible methodology, assessing instance\nquality across crucial dimensions: mathematical validity, structural\nsimilarity, computational hardness, and utility in downstream machine learning\ntasks.

Recent advancements utilize autoregressive modeling, significantly\nenhancing expressive power and generation quality. However, such sequential\nmodeling inherently restricts parallel computation during inference, leading to\nslow generation that impedes practical deployment. In this paper, we first\nidentify that strict sequential dependency in inference is unnecessary to\ngenerate high-quality samples. We observe that patches in sequential modeling\ncan also be approximated without strictly conditioning on all preceding\npatches. Moreover, the models tend to exhibit low dependency redundancy in the\ninitial layer and higher redundancy in subsequent layers. Leveraging these\nobservations, we propose a selective Jacobi decoding (SeJD) strategy that\naccelerates autoregressive inference through parallel iterative optimization.\nTheoretical analyses demonstrate the method's superlinear convergence rate and\nguarantee that the number of iterations required is no greater than the\noriginal sequential approach. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets\nvalidate the generality and effectiveness of our acceleration technique.\nExperiments demonstrate substantial speed improvements up to 4.7 times faster\ninference while keeping the generation quality and fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff08SeJD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u8865\u4e01\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u5e8f\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5197\u4f59\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SeJD\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cSeJD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe4.7\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "SeJD\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although most deep learning approaches primarily focus on\nsRGB images, which inherently lose critical information during the image signal\nprocessing pipeline, RAW images, being unprocessed and linear, possess superior\nrestoration potential but remain underexplored. Deblurring RAW images presents\nunique challenges, particularly in handling frequency-dependent blur while\nmaintaining computational efficiency.

No-reference image quality measures are\noften inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal\nreference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown\nin vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom\nproperties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical\ndigital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a\nquantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of\nthis paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare\nmultiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a\nFourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection\ngeometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time.

While\nspatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively\nstudied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We\npropose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the\njoint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution,\nspectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by\nunfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the\nproximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable\nmodules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial\nsuper-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to\nhandle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using\nlearnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image\nfusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection\nmodules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial\nsuper-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs.

In scenarios where there is a gap between trace\nevents and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation\nproblem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the\ncorresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that\nframes the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract\nArgumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event\ninterpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations\nfor those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where\nevent-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this\nreasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy\ncomputation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to\nsuggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way.\nHowever, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of\nmanually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing\nGreen AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with\nreduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a\ndata/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the\ncandidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is\nrefined by the AAF-based reasoner.

Recent\nwork has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with\ntheorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI\nexplanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into\nmachine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk\nof semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded\nby LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient\nprecision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and\nrobust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate\nissues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates\nstrategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2)\nefficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations,\n(3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured\nproof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback\nfor iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree\nusing different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant\nimprovements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation\nrefinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model. Moreover,\nwe show that specific interventions on the hybrid LLM-TP architecture can\nsubstantially improve efficiency, drastically reducing the number of iterations\nrequired for successful verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\uff08TPs\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff08NLI\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u5728NLI\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46LLMs\u4e0eTPs\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u5931\uff1b2\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\uff1b3\uff09\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfcLLMs\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u8349\u56fe\uff1b4\uff09\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5bf9TP\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728e-SNLI\u3001QASC\u548cWorldTree\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8618.46%-39.77%\u548c29.5%-51.5%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316LLM-TP\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86NLI\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The collision-resistant property of chameleon hash allows for\nstrong model ownership claim upon IP infringement and liable user traceability,\nwhile the trapdoor-collision property enables hashing of multiple user\npassports and licensee certificates to the same immutable signature to realize\nactive usage control. Using the owner passport as an oracle, multiple\nuser-specific triplets, each contains a passport-aware user model, a user\npassport, and a licensee certificate can be created for secure offline\ndistribution.

Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations\nbetween attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination.\nNotably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates\nexpert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10\nexperts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe\ndegradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive\ntasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant\ntasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation.

Despite extensive research\non MTL, various forms of heterogeneity, including distribution and posterior\nheterogeneity, present significant challenges. Existing methods often fail to\naddress these forms of heterogeneity within a unified framework. In this paper,\nwe propose a dual-encoder framework to construct a heterogeneous latent factor\nspace for each task, incorporating a task-shared encoder to capture common\ninformation across tasks and a task-specific encoder to preserve unique task\ncharacteristics. Additionally, we explore the intrinsic similarity structure of\nthe coefficients corresponding to learned latent factors, allowing for adaptive\nintegration across tasks to manage posterior heterogeneity.

While\nthe right initialisation has been extensively studied in feed-forward networks,\nan exact description of signal propagation through a full transformer block has\nso far been lacking.

Here, we present\nOT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized\noptimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type\nhomologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn\n(MESH) technique to refine the OT plan. It begins by selecting genes with high\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to capture the most informative features, from\nwhich a cost matrix is constructed using cosine distances between cell-type\ncentroids. Importantly, the MESH procedure iteratively refines the cost matrix,\nleading to a transport plan with significantly enhanced sparsity and\ninterpretability of the resulting correspondence matrices. Applied to retinal\nbipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque,\nOT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel\ncorrespondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally.

Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to\nmodern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for\nlarge LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on\nthe role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch\npretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs\nwith varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language\nmodeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and\nnatural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during\npretraining.

In this work, we\nchallenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL)\ntraining can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base\nmodels, even under extensive sampling.

However, their intrinsic complexity and\nlack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly\nregulated financial sector, where interpretability, fairness, and\naccountability are critical. As far as we are aware, this paper presents the\nfirst application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the\ninner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the\npressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic\ninterpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM\nbehavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the\nactivations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how\nspecific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not\nonly to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore\nthe theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its\npractical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments,\nincluding applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and\nhallucination detection.

However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g.,\nperceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models\nand committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used\nin applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical\nnetworks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics\nanalysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with\ngeneric weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is\nlarge but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more\nrealistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but\nalso more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on\nthe Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a\ndataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate\naround interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are\ncomparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich\nphenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data\nincreases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons\nof the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to\nlearn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear\ncombinations of the teacher weights, rather than \"specialising\" by aligning its\nweights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes\navailable, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms,\npossibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u5c42\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f29\u5c0f\u5b9e\u9645\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u5c42\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u8fc7\u6e21\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u8d8a\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u8d8a\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u5145\u8db3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}
