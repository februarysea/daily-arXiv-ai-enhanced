### [1] [Cosmos 1.0: a multidimensional map of the emerging technology frontier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10591)
*Xian Gong,Paul X. McCarthy,Colin Griffith,Claire McFarland,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过多源数据构建新兴技术宇宙图谱，创建了包含23,544项技术的Cosmos 1.0数据集，并开发了多个评估指数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过整合多样化的数据源，提供对新兴技术领域的全面洞察。

Method: 利用多源数据构建层次化模型，生成ET23k数据集，并通过人工验证ET100技术。开发了多个评估指数，并训练分类器区分技术与技术相关术语。

Result: 成功构建了包含丰富元数据和验证指标的Cosmos 1.0数据集，提供了对新兴技术的多维度分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为新兴技术研究提供了新的数据支持和分析工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology to map the universe of emerging
technologies, utilising various source data that contain a rich diversity and
breadth of contemporary knowledge to create a new dataset and multiple indices
that provide new insights into these technologies. The Cosmos 1.0 dataset is a
comprehensive collection of 23,544 technologies (ET23k) structured into a
hierarchical model. Each technology is categorised into three meta clusters
(ET3) and seven theme clusters (ET7) enhanced by 100-dimensional embedding
vectors. Within the cosmos, we manually verify 100 emerging technologies called
the ET100. This dataset is enriched with additional indices specifically
developed to assess the landscape of emerging technologies, including the
Technology Awareness Index, Generality Index, Deeptech, and Age of Tech Index.
The dataset incorporates extensive metadata sourced from Wikipedia and linked
data from third-party sources such as Crunchbase, Google Books, OpenAlex and
Google Scholar, which are used to validate the relevance and accuracy of the
constructed indices. Moreover, we trained a classifier to identify whether they
are developed "technology" or technology-related "terms".

### [2] [Measurement to Meaning: A Validity-Centered Framework for AI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10573)
*Olawale Salaudeen,Anka Reuel,Ahmed Ahmed,Suhana Bedi,Zachary Robertson,Sudharsan Sundar,Ben Domingue,Angelina Wang,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化方法，用于评估AI系统的能力，强调现有基准测试的局限性，并通过心理测量学的有效性分析改进评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的评估标准滞后，狭隘的基准测试可能误导对模型能力的判断，需要更严谨的方法来支持评估结论。

Method: 提出一个结构化框架，结合心理测量学的有效性分析，明确评估证据与所声称能力之间的关系。

Result: 通过视觉和语言模型的案例研究，展示了框架如何强化评估证据与声称能力之间的联系。

Conclusion: 该框架能够改进AI系统评估的实证效用和决策效能，为更严谨的评估提供指导。

Abstract: While the capabilities and utility of AI systems have advanced, rigorous
norms for evaluating these systems have lagged. Grand claims, such as models
achieving general reasoning capabilities, are supported with model performance
on narrow benchmarks, like performance on graduate-level exam questions, which
provide a limited and potentially misleading assessment. We provide a
structured approach for reasoning about the types of evaluative claims that can
be made given the available evidence. For instance, our framework helps
determine whether performance on a mathematical benchmark is an indication of
the ability to solve problems on math tests or instead indicates a broader
ability to reason. Our framework is well-suited for the contemporary paradigm
in machine learning, where various stakeholders provide measurements and
evaluations that downstream users use to validate their claims and decisions.
At the same time, our framework also informs the construction of evaluations
designed to speak to the validity of the relevant claims. By leveraging
psychometrics' breakdown of validity, evaluations can prioritize the most
critical facets for a given claim, improving empirical utility and
decision-making efficacy. We illustrate our framework through detailed case
studies of vision and language model evaluations, highlighting how explicitly
considering validity strengthens the connection between evaluation evidence and
the claims being made.

TL;DR: ChestyBot是一种基于语用学的语言模型，能实时检测未标记的外国恶意影响推文，准确率高达98.34%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 俄罗斯和中国的外国信息操作利用美国宽松的信息环境，威胁民主制度和威斯特伐利亚体系，现有检测策略难以实时识别这些活动。

Method: 提出ChestyBot，一种基于语用学的语言模型，用于检测未标记的外国恶意影响推文。

Result: ChestyBot的检测准确率达到98.34%。

Conclusion: ChestyBot支持一种新框架，可在外国影响操作形成阶段进行干扰。

Abstract: Foreign information operations conducted by Russian and Chinese actors
exploit the United States' permissive information environment. These campaigns
threaten democratic institutions and the broader Westphalian model. Yet,
existing detection and mitigation strategies often fail to identify active
information campaigns in real time. This paper introduces ChestyBot, a
pragmatics-based language model that detects unlabeled foreign malign influence
tweets with up to 98.34% accuracy. The model supports a novel framework to
disrupt foreign influence operations in their formative stages.

### [4] [Towards Automated Situation Awareness: A RAG-Based Framework for Peacebuilding Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10586)
*Poli A. Nemkova,Suleyman O. Polat,Rafid I. Jahan,Sagnik Ray Choudhury,Sun-joo Lee,Shouryadipta Sarkar,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态检索增强生成（RAG）系统，用于自动生成实时情境感知报告，结合多源数据，并通过三级评估框架确保报告质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工分析大量异构数据导致的延迟问题，提升人道主义响应、冲突监测和早期预警的决策效率。

Method: 采用动态RAG系统整合实时数据，构建查询特定知识库，并通过三级评估框架（自动NLP指标、专家反馈和LLM评估）确保报告质量。

Result: 系统在多个真实场景中测试，证明能生成连贯、有洞察力且可操作的报告，减轻人工负担并加速决策。

Conclusion: 该系统通过自动化报告生成提升了情境感知的效率和准确性，代码和工具已开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Timely and accurate situation awareness is vital for decision-making in
humanitarian response, conflict monitoring, and early warning and early action.
However, the manual analysis of vast and heterogeneous data sources often
results in delays, limiting the effectiveness of interventions. This paper
introduces a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that
autonomously generates situation awareness reports by integrating real-time
data from diverse sources, including news articles, conflict event databases,
and economic indicators. Our system constructs query-specific knowledge bases
on demand, ensuring timely, relevant, and accurate insights.
  To ensure the quality of generated reports, we propose a three-level
evaluation framework that combines semantic similarity metrics, factual
consistency checks, and expert feedback. The first level employs automated NLP
metrics to assess coherence and factual accuracy. The second level involves
human expert evaluation to verify the relevance and completeness of the
reports. The third level utilizes LLM-as-a-Judge, where large language models
provide an additional layer of assessment to ensure robustness. The system is
tested across multiple real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in
producing coherent, insightful, and actionable reports. By automating report
generation, our approach reduces the burden on human analysts and accelerates
decision-making processes. To promote reproducibility and further research, we
openly share our code and evaluation tools with the community via GitHub.

### [5] [Analyzing Patterns and Influence of Advertising in Print Newspapers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10791)
*N Harsha Vardhan,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Kiran Garimella*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文通过图像处理和OCR技术，从印度五种主要报纸中提取广告数据，分析了印刷广告的模式及其对媒体报道的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究印度印刷报纸中的广告实践，揭示广告与媒体报道之间的关系。

Method: 开发了一个基于图像处理和OCR的管道，从五种报纸中提取广告数据，并进行回归分析。

Result: 发现印刷广告量稳定，政府广告收入占比高，企业广告与媒体报道正相关。

Conclusion: 广告投放显著影响媒体报道的广度和积极性，这一关系在不同时间段和广告商中均成立。

Abstract: This paper investigates advertising practices in print newspapers across
India using a novel data-driven approach. We develop a pipeline employing image
processing and OCR techniques to extract articles and advertisements from
digital versions of print newspapers with high accuracy. Applying this
methodology to five popular newspapers that span multiple regions and three
languages, English, Hindi, and Telugu, we assembled a dataset of more than
12,000 editions containing several hundred thousand advertisements.
Collectively, these newspapers reach a readership of over 100 million people.
Using this extensive dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to answer key
questions about print advertising: who advertises, what they advertise, when
they advertise, where they place their ads, and how they advertise. Our
findings reveal significant patterns, including the consistent level of print
advertising over the past six years despite declining print circulation, the
overrepresentation of company ads on prominent pages, and the disproportionate
revenue contributed by government ads. Furthermore, we examine whether
advertising in a newspaper influences the coverage an advertiser receives.
Through regression analyses on coverage volume and sentiment, we find strong
evidence supporting this hypothesis for corporate advertisers. The results
indicate a clear trend where increased advertising correlates with more
favorable and extensive media coverage, a relationship that remains robust over
time and across different levels of advertiser popularity.

### [6] [Understanding Gen Alpha Digital Language: Evaluation of LLM Safety Systems for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10588)
*Manisha Mehta,Fausto Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究评估了AI系统对Gen Alpha（2010-2024年出生）数字语言的理解能力，发现现有工具难以识别其独特语言中的有害内容，并提出改进框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gen Alpha是首个与AI共同成长的群体，其数字语言（如游戏、梗和AI趋势）导致现有安全工具无法有效识别隐藏的有害互动，亟需研究解决。

Method: 评估了GPT-4、Claude、Gemini和Llama 3四种AI模型对Gen Alpha语言中有害内容的检测能力，使用100条来自游戏平台、社交媒体和视频内容的表达数据集。

Result: 研究发现AI模型在识别Gen Alpha语言中的有害内容时存在严重缺陷，需改进安全系统以匹配其独特沟通方式。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新设计安全系统以适应Gen Alpha的沟通特点，并强调了结合Gen Alpha视角的重要性。

Abstract: This research offers a unique evaluation of how AI systems interpret the
digital language of Generation Alpha (Gen Alpha, born 2010-2024). As the first
cohort raised alongside AI, Gen Alpha faces new forms of online risk due to
immersive digital engagement and a growing mismatch between their evolving
communication and existing safety tools. Their distinct language, shaped by
gaming, memes, and AI-driven trends, often conceals harmful interactions from
both human moderators and automated systems. We assess four leading AI models
(GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama 3) on their ability to detect masked
harassment and manipulation within Gen Alpha discourse. Using a dataset of 100
recent expressions from gaming platforms, social media, and video content, the
study reveals critical comprehension failures with direct implications for
online safety. This work contributes: (1) a first-of-its-kind dataset capturing
Gen Alpha expressions; (2) a framework to improve AI moderation systems for
youth protection; (3) a multi-perspective evaluation including AI systems,
human moderators, and parents, with direct input from Gen Alpha co-researchers;
and (4) an analysis of how linguistic divergence increases youth vulnerability.
Findings highlight the urgent need to redesign safety systems attuned to youth
communication, especially given Gen Alpha reluctance to seek help when adults
fail to understand their digital world. This study combines the insight of a
Gen Alpha researcher with systematic academic analysis to address critical
digital safety challenges.

### [7] [Anchoring AI Capabilities in Market Valuations: The Capability Realization Rate Model and Valuation Misalignment Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10590)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种能力实现率（CRR）模型，用于量化AI潜力与实际表现之间的差距，并分析了AI相关公司的估值溢价与错配现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI能力对股票估值的锚定效应，揭示市场估值与AI实际表现之间的差距。

Method: 利用2023-2025年生成式AI繁荣期的数据，分析行业敏感性，并通过案例研究（如OpenAI、Adobe等）展示估值溢价与错配模式。

Result: AI原生公司因未来潜力获得高估值溢价，而传统公司需证明AI带来的实际回报才能获得重新评级。CRR可帮助识别估值错配风险。

Conclusion: 提出政策建议以提高透明度、减少投机泡沫，并推动AI创新与可持续市场价值的结合。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered surges in
market valuations for AI-related companies, often outpacing the realization of
underlying capabilities. We examine the anchoring effect of AI capabilities on
equity valuations and propose a Capability Realization Rate (CRR) model to
quantify the gap between AI potential and realized performance. Using data from
the 2023--2025 generative AI boom, we analyze sector-level sensitivity and
conduct case studies (OpenAI, Adobe, NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs) to
illustrate patterns of valuation premium and misalignment. Our findings
indicate that AI-native firms commanded outsized valuation premiums anchored to
future potential, while traditional companies integrating AI experienced
re-ratings subject to proof of tangible returns. We argue that CRR can help
identify valuation misalignment risk-where market prices diverge from realized
AI-driven value. We conclude with policy recommendations to improve
transparency, mitigate speculative bubbles, and align AI innovation with
sustainable market value.

Abstract: AI-powered LizAI XT ensures real-time and accurate mega-structure of
different clinical datasets and largely inaccessible and fragmented sources,
into one comprehensive table or any designated forms, based on diseases,
clinical variables, and/or other defined parameters. We evaluate the platform's
performance on a cluster of 4x NVIDIA A30 GPU 24GB, with 16 diseases -- from
deathly cancer and COPD, to conventional ones -- ear infections, including a
total 16,000 patients, $\sim$115,000 medical files, and $\sim$800 clinical
variables. LizAI XT structures data from thousands of files into sets of
variables for each disease in one file, achieving >95.0% overall accuracy,
while providing exceptional outputs in complicated cases of cancers (99.1%),
COPD (98.89%), and asthma (98.12%), without model-overfitting. Data retrieval
is sub-second for a variable per patient with a minimal GPU power, which can
significantly be improved on more powerful GPUs. LizAI XT uniquely enables
fully client-controlled data, complying with strict data security and privacy
regulations per region/nation. Our advances complement the existing EMR/EHR,
AWS HealthLake, and Google Vertex AI platforms, for healthcare data management
and AI development, with large-scalability and expansion at any levels of HMOs,
clinics, pharma, and government.

### [9] [The heteronomy of algorithms: Traditional knowledge and computational knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11030)
*David M. Berry*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文主张通过数字Bildung（教育）培养公民对算法的批判能力，以应对计算系统对社会的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算系统和算法日益渗透社会生活，但当前的计算哲学偏向功利主义，缺乏对知识领域的关怀，亟需批判性研究。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合哲学、政治学、历史学、人类学、社会学、媒体研究、计算机科学和人文学科的概念与方法。

Result: 提出通过数字Bildung提升公民的计算批判能力，并强调跨学科研究的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要开展批判性跨学科研究，以理解计算系统的创建、实施及其规范性影响。

Abstract: If an active citizen should increasingly be a computationally enlightened
one, replacing the autonomy of reason with the heteronomy of algorithms, then I
argue in this article that we must begin teaching the principles of critiquing
the computal through new notions of what we might call digital Bildung. Indeed,
if civil society itself is mediated by computational systems and media, the
public use of reason must also be complemented by skills for negotiating and
using these computal forms to articulate such critique. Not only is there a
need to raise the intellectual tone regarding computation and its related
softwarization processes, but there is an urgent need to attend to the likely
epistemic challenges from computation which, as presently constituted, tends
towards justification through a philosophy of utility rather than through a
philosophy of care for the territory of the intellect. We therefore need to
develop an approach to this field that uses concepts and methods drawn from
philosophy, politics, history, anthropology, sociology, media studies, computer
science, and the humanities more generally, to try to understand these issues -
particularly the way in which software and data increasingly penetrate our
everyday life and the pressures and fissures that are created. We must, in
other words, move to undertake a critical interdisciplinary research program to
understand the way in which these systems are created, instantiated, and
normatively engendered in both specific and general contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示AI语音识别技术在医疗应用中的包容性问题，避免因技术偏见加剧医疗不平等。

Method: 分析现有数据集和研究的偏向性，指出技术对边缘群体的潜在影响。

Result: 发现AI语音识别技术在高资源语言和标准口音上表现更好，但对边缘群体可能产生误识别。

Conclusion: 呼吁设计包容性数据集、开展偏见缓解研究并制定政策框架，以确保AI语音技术在医疗中的公平应用。

Abstract: The integration of AI speech recognition technologies into healthcare has the
potential to revolutionize clinical workflows and patient-provider
communication. However, this study reveals significant gaps in inclusivity,
with datasets and research disproportionately favouring high-resource
languages, standardized accents, and narrow demographic groups. These biases
risk perpetuating healthcare disparities, as AI systems may misinterpret speech
from marginalized groups. This paper highlights the urgent need for inclusive
dataset design, bias mitigation research, and policy frameworks to ensure
equitable access to AI speech technologies in healthcare.

collaboration, enhanced communication, and efficient management of group
projects. However, several challenges were also noted, including low user
adoption rates, limited Google Drive storage capacity, the need for better
technical support, and limited offline functionality. Google Workspace
significantly supports academic collaboration in the normal practices within
the University of Makati, however, it faces challenges that impact its overall
effectiveness. Addressing these issues could improve user experience and
platform efficiency in educational contexts. It is recommended to enhance user
adoption through targeted training and improve offline capabilities.
Additionally, providing more advanced technical support could mitigate existing
challenges.

### [12] [Toward a Public and Secure Generative AI: A Comparative Analysis of Open and Closed LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10603)
*Jorge Machado*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究比较了开源与专有生成式AI系统的优缺点，并提出了一个开放、公共、安全的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对开源与专有生成式AI系统的全面比较研究，需评估其风险与挑战。

Method: 结合文献综述、批判性分析和比较分析的方法。

Result: 开源模型更透明、可审计且灵活，而专有系统技术支持更好但缺乏公平性和问责制。

Conclusion: 多利益相关方治理、环境可持续性和监管框架对负责任发展至关重要。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) systems represent a critical
technology with far-reaching implications across multiple domains of society.
However, their deployment entails a range of risks and challenges that require
careful evaluation. To date, there has been a lack of comprehensive,
interdisciplinary studies offering a systematic comparison between open-source
and proprietary (closed) generative AI systems, particularly regarding their
respective advantages and drawbacks. This study aims to: i) critically evaluate
and compare the characteristics, opportunities, and challenges of open and
closed generative AI models; and ii) propose foundational elements for the
development of an Open, Public, and Safe Gen AI framework. As a methodology, we
adopted a combined approach that integrates three methods: literature review,
critical analysis, and comparative analysis. The proposed framework outlines
key dimensions, openness, public governance, and security, as essential pillars
for shaping the future of trustworthy and inclusive Gen AI. Our findings reveal
that open models offer greater transparency, auditability, and flexibility,
enabling independent scrutiny and bias mitigation. In contrast, closed systems
often provide better technical support and ease of implementation, but at the
cost of unequal access, accountability, and ethical oversight. The research
also highlights the importance of multi-stakeholder governance, environmental
sustainability, and regulatory frameworks in ensuring responsible development.

representative synthetic population of citizens, an LLM-enabled agent-based
simulation engine, and a user interface that enable intuitive, natural language
interactions with the simulation engine and the artificial agents (i.e.
citizens). Social Digital Twinner facilitates real-time engagement and empowers
stakeholders to collaboratively design, test, and refine intervention measures.
The approach is promoting a data-driven and evidence-based approach to societal
problem-solving. We demonstrate the tool's interactive capabilities by
addressing the critical issue of youth school dropouts in Kragero, Norway,
showcasing its ability to create and execute a dedicated social digital twin
using natural language.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Phare是一个多语言诊断框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在幻觉与可靠性、社会偏见和有害内容生成三个关键维度的行为，揭示了系统性漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注性能而非失败模式，Phare旨在提供更全面的安全评估。

Method: 通过Phare框架对17种先进LLMs进行多维度评估，识别系统性漏洞。

Result: 发现模型在多个安全维度存在系统性漏洞，如奉承、提示敏感性和刻板印象再现。

Conclusion: Phare为构建更健壮、对齐且可信的语言系统提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for
responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance
over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic
framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions:
hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation.
Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic
vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt
sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific
failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and
practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and
trustworthy language systems.

### [15] [The Effects of Moral Framing on Online Fundraising Outcomes: Evidence from GoFundMe Campaigns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11367)
*Ji Eun Kim,Libby Hemphill*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究分析了道德框架对众筹结果的影响，发现负面框架（强调伤害和不公）能吸引更多捐款和评论，但可能降低单笔捐款金额；忠诚框架则普遍有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨道德框架（关怀、公平、忠诚）如何影响众筹活动的货币和社会支持结果。

Method: 分析GoFundMe上14,088个众筹活动的数据，测量三种道德框架在活动呼吁中的表现。

Result: 紧急类活动受道德框架影响最大；负面框架吸引更多支持但降低单笔金额；忠诚框架在所有类别中均有效。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了众筹沟通策略的文献，并为在线众筹平台设计提供了实用建议。

Abstract: This study examines the impact of moral framing on fundraising outcomes,
including both monetary and social support, by analyzing a dataset of 14,088
campaigns posted on GoFundMe. We focused on three moral frames: care, fairness,
and (ingroup) loyalty, and measured their presence in campaign appeals. Our
results show that campaigns in the Emergency category are most influenced by
moral framing. Generally, negatively framing appeals by emphasizing harm and
unfairness effectively attracts more donations and comments from supporters.
However, this approach can have a downside, as it may lead to a decrease in the
average donation amount per donor. Additionally, we found that loyalty framing
was positively associated with receiving more donations and messages across all
fundraising categories. This research extends existing literature on framing
and communication strategies related to fundraising and their impact. We also
propose practical implications for designing features of online fundraising
platforms to better support both fundraisers and supporters.

*Jing Liu,Xinxing Ren,Yanmeng Xu,Zekun Guo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究提出并实现了首个基于LLM代理的多任务舆情分析自动化流程，无需领域特定数据或人工标注，适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统舆情分析方法需要领域特定数据和人工干预，成本高且效率低。本研究旨在通过LLM技术实现低成本、自动化的舆情分析。

Method: 采用基于LLM代理的端到端自动化流程，用户仅需自然语言查询即可生成多部分分析报告。

Result: 在2025年美中关税争端的案例中，分析了1,572条微博，生成结构化报告，揭示了公众意见与政府决策的关联。

Conclusion: 该研究为生成式AI在公共治理中的应用提供了新思路，解决了舆情监测中技术复杂性与实际可用性之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: This study proposes and implements the first LLM agents based agentic
pipeline for multi task public opinion analysis. Unlike traditional methods, it
offers an end-to-end, fully automated analytical workflow without requiring
domain specific training data, manual annotation, or local deployment. The
pipeline integrates advanced LLM capabilities into a low-cost, user-friendly
framework suitable for resource constrained environments. It enables timely,
integrated public opinion analysis through a single natural language query,
making it accessible to non-expert users. To validate its effectiveness, the
pipeline was applied to a real world case study of the 2025 U.S. China tariff
dispute, where it analyzed 1,572 Weibo posts and generated a structured, multi
part analytical report. The results demonstrate some relationships between
public opinion and governmental decision-making. These contributions represent
a novel advancement in applying generative AI to public governance, bridging
the gap between technical sophistication and practical usability in public
opinion monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳本雅明关于艺术真实性的观点，探讨AI艺术的无真实性如何为艺术创作带来新维度。

Method: 提出无真实性艺术的两个特征——‘难以捉摸性’和‘投射性’，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。

Result: AI艺术的无真实性拓宽了艺术和创造力的可能性。

Conclusion: 论文引发思考：AI的无真实性创造力是否可延伸至人类身份认知。

Abstract: Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.

Motivation: 研究AI推荐算法如何通过不同的方式重塑人类体验，并探讨由此引发的矛盾与自由之间的权衡。

Method: 通过分析四种推荐算法对体验的重塑方式，对比两种个人身份的形成路径。

Result: 发现推荐算法既能通过强化现有偏好产生愉悦与真实性，也能通过激发新兴趣带来自由与新身份。

Conclusion: AI推荐算法在人类体验中创造了愉悦与自由之间的新矛盾，引发了关于个人身份本质的思考。

Abstract: Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CDGLT的高效训练框架，用于多模态隐喻识别，通过概念漂移和提示构造策略提升性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态隐喻（如网络迷因）的理解存在挑战，现有方法难以弥合字面与比喻解释之间的差距，且生成方法计算成本高。

Method: CDGLT结合概念漂移机制（利用CLIP编码器的跨模态嵌入生成新概念）和提示构造策略，优化特征提取与融合。

Result: 在MET-Meme基准上达到最优性能，同时显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: CDGLT为高效准确的多模态隐喻理解提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Metaphorical imagination, the ability to connect seemingly unrelated
concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and communication. While
understanding linguistic metaphors has advanced significantly, grasping
multimodal metaphors, such as those found in internet memes, presents unique
challenges due to their unconventional expressions and implied meanings.
Existing methods for multimodal metaphor identification often struggle to
bridge the gap between literal and figurative interpretations. Additionally,
generative approaches that utilize large language models or text-to-image
models, while promising, suffer from high computational costs. This paper
introduces \textbf{C}oncept \textbf{D}rift \textbf{G}uided \textbf{L}ayerNorm
\textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CDGLT}), a novel and training-efficient framework for
multimodal metaphor identification. CDGLT incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Concept Drift, a mechanism that leverages Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP) of cross-modal embeddings from a CLIP encoder to generate a new,
divergent concept embedding. This drifted concept helps to alleviate the gap
between literal features and the figurative task. (2) A prompt construction
strategy, that adapts the method of feature extraction and fusion using
pre-trained language models for the multimodal metaphor identification task.
CDGLT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MET-Meme benchmark while
significantly reducing training costs compared to existing generative methods.
Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of both Concept Drift and our
adapted LN Tuning approach. Our method represents a significant step towards
efficient and accurate multimodal metaphor understanding. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在非西方文化背景下表现有限，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 采用半自动化流程，利用GPT-4生成候选问题，并人工筛选以确保数据质量。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在文化相关的视觉内容推理上仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究开发更具文化包容性和上下文感知的多模态系统。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced the ability of artificial intelligence systems to
understand and generate multimodal content. However, these models often exhibit
limited effectiveness when applied to non-Western cultural contexts, which
raises concerns about their wider applicability. To address this limitation, we
propose the \textbf{T}raditional \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{C}ulture
understanding \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{TCC-Bench}), a bilingual
(\textit{i.e.}, Chinese and English) Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark
specifically designed for assessing the understanding of traditional Chinese
culture by MLLMs. TCC-Bench comprises culturally rich and visually diverse
data, incorporating images from museum artifacts, everyday life scenes, comics,
and other culturally significant contexts. We adopt a semi-automated pipeline
that utilizes GPT-4o in text-only mode to generate candidate questions,
followed by human curation to ensure data quality and avoid potential data
leakage. The benchmark also avoids language bias by preventing direct
disclosure of cultural concepts within question texts. Experimental evaluations
across a wide range of MLLMs demonstrate that current models still face
significant challenges when reasoning about culturally grounded visual content.
The results highlight the need for further research in developing culturally
inclusive and context-aware multimodal systems. The code and data can be found

Result: 仿真和实车测试表明，该框架能安全交互并遵守交通规则。

Conclusion: 框架有效解决了复杂交通环境中的自动驾驶决策问题。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in urban autonomous vehicle decision-making and
planning lies in effectively managing intricate interactions with diverse
traffic participants characterized by unpredictable movement patterns.
Additionally, interpreting and adhering to traffic regulations within rapidly
evolving traffic scenarios pose significant hurdles. This paper proposed a
rule-based autonomous vehicle decision-making and planning framework which
extracts right-of-way from traffic rules to generate behavioural parameters,
integrating them to effectively adhere to and navigate through traffic
regulations. The framework considers the strong interaction between traffic
participants mathematically by formulating the decision-making and planning
problem into a differential game. By finding the Nash equilibrium of the
problem, the autonomous vehicle is able to find optimal decisions. The proposed
framework was tested under simulation as well as full-size vehicle platform,
the results show that the ego vehicle is able to safely interact with
surrounding traffic participants while adhering to traffic rules.

*Binwen Liu,Jiexi Ge,Jiamin Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Vaiage 是一个基于大语言模型（LLMs）的旅行规划系统，通过多智能体框架实现个性化、动态和交互式的行程规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划平台无法满足动态需求，缺乏上下文适应性和实时交互能力。

Method: 采用图结构的多智能体框架，利用 LLMs 推断用户意图、推荐目的地并生成符合约束条件的行程。通过自然语言交互和地图反馈实现自适应规划。

Result: 实验显示 Vaiage 平均得分 8.5/10，优于无策略（7.2）和无外部 API（6.8）版本，智能体协调显著提升行程质量。

Conclusion: 结合 LLM 推理和符号智能体协调，Vaiage 在开放世界规划任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Planning trips is a cognitively intensive task involving conflicting user
preferences, dynamic external information, and multi-step temporal-spatial
optimization. Traditional platforms often fall short - they provide static
results, lack contextual adaptation, and fail to support real-time interaction
or intent refinement.
  Our approach, Vaiage, addresses these challenges through a graph-structured
multi-agent framework built around large language models (LLMs) that serve as
both goal-conditioned recommenders and sequential planners. LLMs infer user
intent, suggest personalized destinations and activities, and synthesize
itineraries that align with contextual constraints such as budget, timing,
group size, and weather. Through natural language interaction, structured tool
use, and map-based feedback loops, Vaiage enables adaptive, explainable, and
end-to-end travel planning grounded in both symbolic reasoning and
conversational understanding.
  To evaluate Vaiage, we conducted human-in-the-loop experiments using
rubric-based GPT-4 assessments and qualitative feedback. The full system
achieved an average score of 8.5 out of 10, outperforming the no-strategy (7.2)
and no-external-API (6.8) variants, particularly in feasibility. Qualitative
analysis indicated that agent coordination - especially the Strategy and
Information Agents - significantly improved itinerary quality by optimizing
time use and integrating real-time context. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining LLM reasoning with symbolic agent coordination in
open-ended, real-world planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL在复杂军事场景中缺乏可解释性，限制了其实际部署，而可解释性对信任、安全和与人类策略的一致性至关重要。

Method: 研究评估了现有的MARL可解释性方法，并将其应用于不同空战场景，以获取模型行为的解释性见解。

Result: 通过将AI生成的战术与人类可理解的推理联系起来，强调了透明性对可靠部署和人机交互的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了可解释性在推动MARL用于防御作战中的关键作用，支持战略规划和军事人员培训。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping strategic planning, with
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enabling coordination among
autonomous agents in complex scenarios. However, its practical deployment in
sensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which
is an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies.
This work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for
MARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting
various explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain
explanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics
with human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to
ensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By
illuminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for
operational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the
training of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于网络的计算框架，用于检测TikTok上的协调不真实行为（CIB），填补了视频优先平台研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注文本平台，而TikTok等视频平台的CIB检测研究不足，亟需针对性解决方案。

Method: 通过构建用户相似性网络（基于同步发布、重复标题、多媒体内容重用等行为），并应用图剪枝技术识别协调账户。

Result: 在2024年美国总统选举相关数据集中发现多种协调行为，如政治叙事同步放大和AI生成内容复制。

Conclusion: 传统协调指标在TikTok上部分有效，但需适应其独特的内容规范和交互机制，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) is central to the study of
online influence operations. However, most methods focus on text-centric
platforms, leaving video-first ecosystems like TikTok largely unexplored. To
address this gap, we develop and evaluate a computational framework for
detecting CIB on TikTok, leveraging a network-based approach adapted to the
platform's unique content and interaction structures. Building on existing
approaches, we construct user similarity networks based on shared behaviors,
including synchronized posting, repeated use of similar captions, multimedia
content reuse, and hashtag sequence overlap, and apply graph pruning techniques
to identify dense networks of likely coordinated accounts. Analyzing a dataset
of 793K TikTok videos related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we
uncover a range of coordinated activities, from synchronized amplification of
political narratives to semi-automated content replication using AI-generated
voiceovers and split-screen video formats. Our findings show that while
traditional coordination indicators generalize well to TikTok, other signals,
such as those based on textual similarity of video transcripts or Duet and
Stitch interactions, prove ineffective, highlighting the platform's distinct
content norms and interaction mechanics. This work provides the first empirical
foundation for studying and detecting CIB on TikTok, paving the way for future
research into influence operations in short-form video platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频已成为主流在线内容形式，但针对未成年用户的有害视频审核效果尚不明确，亟需评估。

Method: 创建13岁和18岁实验账户，在TikTok、YouTube和Instagram上评估3000个视频，记录有害视频的出现频率和速度。

Result: 13岁账户在被动浏览中接触有害视频的频率更高（YouTube上15% vs 18岁的8.17%），且更快（平均3:06分钟）。

Conclusion: 当前视频审核存在明显漏洞，需加强年龄验证和算法过滤系统。

Abstract: Video-sharing social media platforms, such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram,
implement content moderation policies aimed at reducing exposure to harmful
videos among minor users. As video has become the dominant and most immersive
form of online content, understanding how effectively this medium is moderated
for younger audiences is urgent. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness
of video moderation for different age groups on three of the main video-sharing
platforms: TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. We created experimental accounts for
the children assigned ages 13 and 18. Using these accounts, we evaluated 3,000
videos served up by the social media platforms, in passive scrolling and search
modes, recording the frequency and speed at which harmful videos were
encountered. Each video was manually assessed for level and type of harm, using
definitions from a unified framework of harmful content.
  The results show that for passive scrolling or search-based scrolling,
accounts assigned to the age 13 group encountered videos that were deemed
harmful, more frequently and quickly than those assigned to the age 18 group.
On YouTube, 15\% of recommended videos to 13-year-old accounts during passive
scrolling were assessed as harmful, compared to 8.17\% for 18-year-old
accounts. On YouTube, videos labelled as harmful appeared within an average of
3:06 minutes of passive scrolling for the younger age group. Exposure occurred
without user-initiated searches, indicating weaknesses in the algorithmic
filtering systems. These findings point to significant gaps in current video
moderation practices by social media platforms. Furthermore, the ease with
which underage users can misrepresent their age demonstrates the urgent need
for more robust verification methods.

Motivation: 现实世界中，个体的感染或信息状态往往不可直接观测，但中间指标（如症状）可观测。研究旨在解决这种部分可观测性下的传播动态分析问题。

Method: 提出Distribution Classification方法，利用分类器的能力推断传播动态的底层特性。

Result: 方法在合成网络（尤其是高循环连通性的复杂网络）和真实内幕交易网络中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于分析无法直接观测个体状态的现实传播现象。

Abstract: The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the
assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully
observable. However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain
unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to
further spread the infection. While this final status is hidden, intermediate
indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide important
insights into the spread process. We propose a partial observability-aware
Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model.
We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of
classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. We evaluate our
method on two types of synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world
insider trading network. Results show that the method performs well, especially
on complex networks with high cyclic connectivity, supporting its utility in
analyzing real-world spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual
statuses is not possible.

Abstract: We discuss the challenges and propose a framework for evaluating engineering
artificial general intelligence (eAGI) agents. We consider eAGI as a
specialization of artificial general intelligence (AGI), deemed capable of
addressing a broad range of problems in the engineering of physical systems and
associated controllers. We exclude software engineering for a tractable scoping
of eAGI and expect dedicated software engineering AI agents to address the
software implementation challenges. Similar to human engineers, eAGI agents
should possess a unique blend of background knowledge (recall and retrieve) of
facts and methods, demonstrate familiarity with tools and processes, exhibit
deep understanding of industrial components and well-known design families, and
be able to engage in creative problem solving (analyze and synthesize),
transferring ideas acquired in one context to another. Given this broad
mandate, evaluating and qualifying the performance of eAGI agents is a
challenge in itself and, arguably, a critical enabler to developing eAGI
agents. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing an extensible
evaluation framework that specializes and grounds Bloom's taxonomy - a
framework for evaluating human learning that has also been recently used for
evaluating LLMs - in an engineering design context. Our proposed framework
advances the state of the art in benchmarking and evaluation of AI agents in
terms of the following: (a) developing a rich taxonomy of evaluation questions
spanning from methodological knowledge to real-world design problems; (b)
motivating a pluggable evaluation framework that can evaluate not only textual
responses but also evaluate structured design artifacts such as CAD models and
SysML models; and (c) outlining an automatable procedure to customize the
evaluation benchmark to different engineering contexts.

Conclusion: 结合博弈论评估和表示引导对齐的方法，有望推广到现实世界的终端设备和嵌入式平台应用中。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) enable novel use
cases in domains where responsible action is increasingly important. Yet the
inherent unpredictability of LLMs raises safety concerns about agent
reliability. In this work, we explore agent behaviour in a toy, game-theoretic
environment based on a variation of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. We
introduce a strategy-modification method-independent of both the game and the
prompt-by steering the residual stream with interpretable features extracted
from a sparse autoencoder latent space. Steering with the good-faith
negotiation feature lowers the average defection probability by 28 percentage
points. We also identify feasible steering ranges for several open-source LLM
agents. Finally, we hypothesise that game-theoretic evaluation of LLM agents,
combined with representation-steering alignment, can generalise to real-world
applications on end-user devices and embodied platforms.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is gaining momentum in the

behavior-based or embodied alternatives (R. A. Brooks 1991; Pfeifer and Scheier
2001). We claim that the AI-powered robots are only weakly embodied and inherit
some of the problems of GOFAI. Moreover, we review and critically discuss the
possibility of cross-embodiment learning (Padalkar et al. 2024). We identify
fundamental roadblocks and propose directions on how to make progress.

Abstract: Current AI benchmarks miss the messy, multi-turn nature of human-AI
collaboration. We present an evaluation framework that decomposes real-world
tasks into interdependent subtasks, letting us track both LLM performance and
users' strategies across a dialogue. Complementing this framework, we develop a
suite of metrics, including a composite usage derived from semantic similarity,
word overlap, and numerical matches; structural coherence; intra-turn
diversity; and a novel measure of the "information frontier" reflecting the
alignment between AI outputs and users' working knowledge. We demonstrate our
methodology in a financial valuation task that mirrors real-world complexity.
Our empirical findings reveal that while greater integration of LLM-generated
content generally enhances output quality, its benefits are moderated by
factors such as response incoherence, excessive subtask diversity, and the
distance of provided information from users' existing knowledge. These results
suggest that proactive dialogue strategies designed to inject novelty may
inadvertently undermine task performance. Our work thus advances a more
holistic evaluation of human-AI collaboration, offering both a robust
methodological framework and actionable insights for developing more effective
AI-augmented work processes.

*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Zhisheng Tang,Mayank Kejriwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迭代程序化规划（IPP）的框架，利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成可解释的代码策略，解决网格任务，并在性能和成本上优于直接代码生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统搜索或强化学习方法在网格任务中效率不足，希望通过代码生成策略提高任务解决效率和可解释性。

Method: 采用代码生成作为策略合成，结合多种提示策略（直接代码生成、伪代码条件细化、课程提示）和迭代细化机制，根据任务反馈更新代码。

Result: 在六个LLM和两个网格基准测试（GRASP和MiniGrid）上验证，IPP框架性能提升显著（10%至10倍），并在GRASP上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: IPP框架在性能和成本上优于直接解决方案生成，证明了代码生成策略的可行性。

Abstract: We propose an iterative programmatic planning (IPP) framework for solving
grid-based tasks by synthesizing interpretable agent policies expressed in code
using large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on traditional search or
reinforcement learning, our approach uses code generation as policy synthesis,
where the LLM outputs executable programs that map environment states to action
sequences. Our proposed architecture incorporates several prompting strategies,
including direct code generation, pseudocode-conditioned refinement, and
curriculum-based prompting, but also includes an iterative refinement mechanism
that updates code based on task performance feedback. We evaluate our approach
using six leading LLMs and two challenging grid-based benchmarks (GRASP and
MiniGrid). Our IPP framework demonstrates improvements over direct code
generation ranging from 10\% to as much as 10x across five of the six models
and establishes a new state-of-the-art result for GRASP. IPP is found to
significantly outperform direct elicitation of a solution from GPT-o3-mini (by
63\% on MiniGrid to 116\% on GRASP), demonstrating the viability of the overall
approach. Computational costs of all code generation approaches are similar.
While code generation has a higher initial prompting cost compared to direct
solution elicitation (\$0.08 per task vs. \$0.002 per instance for
GPT-o3-mini), the code can be reused for any number of instances, making the
amortized cost significantly lower (by 400x on GPT-o3-mini across the complete
GRASP benchmark).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设AI系统可能具备主观体验，探讨其主观体验质量与性能指标的关系。

Method: 基于强化学习框架和心灵哲学理论，提出数学问题设置及初步方法。

Result: 提出促进强化的方法，并优化问题设置。

Conclusion: 强调AI主观体验的重要性，并提出研究框架和方法。

Abstract: This report explores the speculative question: what if current or future AI
systems have qualia, such as pain or pleasure? It does so by assuming that AI
systems might someday possess qualia -- and that the quality of these
subjective experiences should be considered alongside performance metrics.
Concrete mathematical problem settings, inspired by reinforcement learning
formulations and theories from philosophy of mind, are then proposed and
initial approaches and properties are presented. These properties enable
refinement of the problem setting, culminating with the proposal of methods
that promote reinforcement.

*Trisha Das,Afrah Shafquat,Beigi Mandis,Jacob Aptekar,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过总结临床试验协议并基于查询试验协议搜索相似的历史试验，显著提升了相似试验识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验资源密集且风险高，历史试验的参考价值大，但现有方法在识别相似试验上效果不佳。

Method: 总结临床试验协议并基于查询试验协议搜索相似的历史试验。

Result: 新方法在召回率和精确度上显著优于基线，分别提升78%和53%，并在部分试验相似性搜索和零样本患者-试验匹配中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效优化试验设计，提升患者安全和试验效率。

Abstract: Clinical trials are vital for evaluation of safety and efficacy of new
treatments. However, clinical trials are resource-intensive, time-consuming and
expensive to conduct, where errors in trial design, reduced efficacy, and
safety events can result in significant delays, financial losses, and damage to
reputation. These risks underline the importance of informed and strategic
decisions in trial design to mitigate these risks and improve the chances of a
successful trial. Identifying similar historical trials is critical as these
trials can provide an important reference for potential pitfalls and challenges
including serious adverse events, dosage inaccuracies, recruitment
difficulties, patient adherence issues, etc. Addressing these challenges in
trial design can lead to development of more effective study protocols with
optimized patient safety and trial efficiency. In this paper, we present a
novel method to identify similar historical trials by summarizing clinical
trial protocols and searching for similar trials based on a query trial's
protocol. Our approach significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving up to
a 78% improvement in recall@1 and a 53% improvement in precision@1 over the
best baseline. We also show that our method outperforms all other baselines in
partial trial similarity search and zero-shot patient-trial matching,
highlighting its superior utility in these tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于人机交互（HAII）的强化学习（RL）框架，通过量化农民对AI施肥策略的信任度，优化农业管理建议的实用性和社会接受度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在农业中的应用受到算法建议与农民实际经验、本地知识和传统实践之间的差距限制，研究旨在通过提升透明度和信任促进AI的广泛采用。

Method: 采用信任框架（能力、善意、诚信）开发数学模型，量化农民对AI的信任，并将调查结果整合到多目标RL框架中。

Result: 研究揭示了农民与AI建议的关键偏差，并将信任直接嵌入策略优化，确保建议在技术、经济、社会层面均可行。

Conclusion: 通过结合技术性能与以人为本的信任，该研究为农业中AI的广泛采用提供了支持。

Abstract: Precision agriculture, enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI), offers
promising tools such as remote sensing, intelligent irrigation, fertilization
management, and crop simulation to improve agricultural efficiency and
sustainability. Reinforcement learning (RL), in particular, has outperformed
traditional methods in optimizing yields and resource management. However,
widespread AI adoption is limited by gaps between algorithmic recommendations
and farmers' practical experience, local knowledge, and traditional practices.
To address this, our study emphasizes Human-AI Interaction (HAII), focusing on
transparency, usability, and trust in RL-based farm management. We employ a
well-established trust framework - comprising ability, benevolence, and
integrity - to develop a novel mathematical model quantifying farmers'
confidence in AI-based fertilization strategies. Surveys conducted with farmers
for this research reveal critical misalignments, which are integrated into our
trust model and incorporated into a multi-objective RL framework. Unlike prior
methods, our approach embeds trust directly into policy optimization, ensuring
AI recommendations are technically robust, economically feasible,
context-aware, and socially acceptable. By aligning technical performance with
human-centered trust, this research supports broader AI adoption in
agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的现有传感器（如摄像头和激光雷达）易受光照和天气条件变化的影响，导致实时道路条件感知困难。

Method: 提出IMF网络，包括光照感知子网络和多模态融合网络，动态调整不同模态的权重，并通过预训练和光照损失优化训练过程。

Result: 实验表明，IMF在性能上优于现有方法，多模态融合在变化光照条件下具有全面优势。

Conclusion: IMF通过光照感知和多模态融合，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在复杂光照条件下的道路地形感知能力。

Abstract: Road terrains play a crucial role in ensuring the driving safety of
autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing sensors of AVs, including cameras
and Lidars, are susceptible to variations in lighting and weather conditions,
making it challenging to achieve real-time perception of road conditions. In
this paper, we propose an illumination-aware multi-modal fusion network (IMF),
which leverages both exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception and optimizes
the fusion process based on illumination features. We introduce an
illumination-perception sub-network to accurately estimate illumination
features. Moreover, we design a multi-modal fusion network which is able to
dynamically adjust weights of different modalities according to illumination
features. We enhance the optimization process by pre-training of the
illumination-perception sub-network and incorporating illumination loss as one
of the training constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IMF
shows a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The
comparison results with single modality perception methods highlight the
comprehensive advantages of multi-modal fusion in accurately perceiving road
terrains under varying lighting conditions. Our dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的世界模型需要大量训练数据且难以灵活更新，而程序化世界模型能从小样本中泛化，但此前仅适用于简单领域。本文旨在扩展其应用至复杂非网格世界。

Method: 提出PoE-World方法，将世界模型表示为LLMs合成的程序化专家的指数加权乘积，支持从少量观察中学习复杂随机模型。

Result: 在Atari的Pong和Montezuma's Revenge游戏中，该方法表现出高效性能和泛化能力，能处理未见过的关卡。

Conclusion: PoE-World展示了程序化世界模型在复杂领域的潜力，为小样本学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning how the world works is central to building AI agents that can adapt
to complex environments. Traditional world models based on deep learning demand
vast amounts of training data, and do not flexibly update their knowledge from
sparse observations. Recent advances in program synthesis using Large Language
Models (LLMs) give an alternate approach which learns world models represented
as source code, supporting strong generalization from little data. To date,
application of program-structured world models remains limited to natural
language and grid-world domains. We introduce a novel program synthesis method
for effectively modeling complex, non-gridworld domains by representing a world
model as an exponentially-weighted product of programmatic experts (PoE-World)
synthesized by LLMs. We show that this approach can learn complex, stochastic
world models from just a few observations. We evaluate the learned world models
by embedding them in a model-based planning agent, demonstrating efficient
performance and generalization to unseen levels on Atari's Pong and Montezuma's
Revenge. We release our code and display the learned world models and videos of
the agent's gameplay at https://topwasu.github.io/poe-world.

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代语义通信提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have introduced
groundbreaking approaches to innovating next-generation semantic communication,
which prioritizes conveying the meaning of a message rather than merely
transmitting raw data. A fundamental challenge in semantic communication lies
in accurately identifying and extracting the most critical semantic information
while adapting to downstream tasks without degrading performance, particularly
when the objective at the receiver may evolve over time. To enable flexible
adaptation to multiple tasks at the receiver, this work introduces a novel
semantic communication framework, which is capable of jointly capturing
task-specific information to enhance downstream task performance and contextual
information. Through rigorous experiments on popular image datasets and
computer vision tasks, our framework shows promising improvement compared to
existing work, including superior performance in downstream tasks, better
generalizability, ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, and low reconstruction
latency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于长篇叙述形式的脑筋急转弯基准，用于深入探究模型使用的推理策略，评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决新颖问题时的创造性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统准确率指标无法揭示模型的推理过程，因此需要一种新方法来评估模型的推理策略和创造性。

Method: 通过脑筋急转弯任务，研究LLMs在语义解析、解决方案生成、自我纠正、分步解答和利用提示等方面的表现。

Result: LLMs在某些情况下能提供创造性的解决方案，但也存在依赖暴力求解的情况。

Conclusion: LLMs具备一定的创造性问题解决能力，但在推理效率上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers
limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we
introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to
probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use.
Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with
multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight
or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language
models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on
correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We
investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the
brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2)
generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting
solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of
solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases
able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that
they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative
ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force
despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a
potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Result: 在图像分类任务中表现优异，显著提升遗忘效果。

Conclusion: MCU是一种即插即用框架，可无缝集成现有方法，持续提升遗忘效果。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the information of specific training
data from a trained model, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and
user requests. While one line of existing MU methods relies on linear parameter
updates via task arithmetic, they suffer from weight entanglement. In this
work, we propose a novel MU framework called Mode Connectivity Unlearning (MCU)
that leverages mode connectivity to find an unlearning pathway in a nonlinear
manner. To further enhance performance and efficiency, we introduce a parameter
mask strategy that not only improves unlearning effectiveness but also reduces
computational overhead. Moreover, we propose an adaptive adjustment strategy
for our unlearning penalty coefficient to adaptively balance forgetting quality
and predictive performance during training, eliminating the need for empirical
hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional MU methods that identify only a
single unlearning model, MCU uncovers a spectrum of unlearning models along the
pathway. Overall, MCU serves as a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly
integrates with any existing MU methods, consistently improving unlearning
efficacy. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate
that MCU achieves superior performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces \textsc{InfantAgent-Next}, a generalist agent capable
of interacting with computers in a multimodal manner, encompassing text,

intricate workflows around a single large model or only provide workflow
modularity, our agent integrates tool-based and pure vision agents within a
highly modular architecture, enabling different models to collaboratively solve
decoupled tasks in a step-by-step manner. Our generality is demonstrated by our
ability to evaluate not only pure vision-based real-world benchmarks (i.e.,
OSWorld), but also more general or tool-intensive benchmarks (e.g., GAIA and
SWE-Bench). Specifically, we achieve $\mathbf{7.27\%}$ accuracy on OSWorld,

Conclusion: MPS-Prover提升了基于LLM的形式推理能力，为开发更强大的定理证明器提供了框架。

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages remains a formidable
challenge in AI, demanding rigorous logical deduction and navigating vast
search spaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
performance, existing stepwise provers often suffer from biased search
guidance, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal proof strategies. This paper
introduces the Multi-Perspective Search Prover (MPS-Prover), a novel stepwise
ATP system designed to overcome these limitations. MPS-Prover incorporates two
key innovations: a highly effective post-training data curation strategy that
prunes approximately 40% of redundant training data without sacrificing
performance, and a multi-perspective tree search mechanism. This search
integrates a learned critic model with strategically designed heuristic rules
to diversify tactic selection, prevent getting trapped in unproductive states,
and enhance search robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
MPS-Prover achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging
benchmarks, including miniF2F and ProofNet, outperforming prior 7B parameter
models. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that MPS-Prover generates
significantly shorter and more diverse proofs compared to existing stepwise and
whole-proof methods, highlighting its efficiency and efficacy. Our work
advances the capabilities of LLM-based formal reasoning and offers a robust
framework and a comprehensive analysis for developing more powerful theorem
provers.

Motivation: 探讨不同提示策略在扩展计算资源时的表现，并优化多数投票（majority voting）的性能。

Method: 在6个LLM、8种提示策略和6个基准上系统实验，结合概率理论提出预测方法。

Result: 复杂策略在初始表现优越，但随着资源增加，简单策略更优。理论分析支持这一现象。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新审视复杂提示的作用，并提供了提升扩展性能的新方法。

Abstract: Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has
garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how
various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we
focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We
systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies
$\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the
sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting
strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple
Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs.
Additionally, we propose a method according to probability theory to quickly
and accurately predict the scaling performance and select the best strategy
under large sampling times without extra resource-intensive inference in
practice. It can serve as the test-time scaling law for majority voting.
Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to
significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can
promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential
of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing
test-time scaling performance.

Result: 涉及facets的任务比计数扩展更容易，实验证明了其可行性。

Conclusion: facets为推理提供了一种高效且实用的方法，适用于用户导航和过滤特定参数的需求。

Abstract: Argumentation is a central subarea of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
modeling and reasoning about arguments. The semantics of abstract argumentation
frameworks (AFs) is given by sets of arguments (extensions) and conditions on
the relationship between them, such as stable or admissible. Today's solvers
implement tasks such as finding extensions, deciding credulous or skeptical
acceptance, counting, or enumerating extensions. While these tasks are well
charted, the area between decision, counting/enumeration and fine-grained
reasoning requires expensive reasoning so far. We introduce a novel concept
(facets) for reasoning between decision and enumeration. Facets are arguments
that belong to some extensions (credulous) but not to all extensions
(skeptical). They are most natural when a user aims to navigate, filter, or
comprehend the significance of specific arguments, according to their needs. We
study the complexity and show that tasks involving facets are much easier than
counting extensions. Finally, we provide an implementation, and conduct
experiments to demonstrate feasibility.

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展且适应性强，为智能制造决策提供了基础。

Abstract: Plastic injection molding remains essential to modern manufacturing. However,
optimizing process parameters to balance product quality and profitability
under dynamic environmental and economic conditions remains a persistent
challenge. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
framework for real-time process optimization in injection molding, integrating
product quality and profitability into the control objective. A profit function
was developed to reflect real-world manufacturing costs, incorporating resin,
mold wear, and electricity prices, including time-of-use variations. Surrogate
models were constructed to predict product quality and cycle time, enabling
efficient offline training of DRL agents using soft actor-critic (SAC) and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed DRL framework can dynamically adapt to seasonal and
operational variations, consistently maintaining product quality while
maximizing profit. Compared to traditional optimization methods such as genetic
algorithms, the DRL models achieved comparable economic performance with up to
135x faster inference speeds, making them well-suited for real-time
applications. The framework's scalability and adaptability highlight its
potential as a foundation for intelligent, data-driven decision-making in
modern manufacturing environments.

Conclusion: RAGSynth通过优化检索器和生成器，有效提升了RAG系统的整体性能。

Abstract: RAG can enhance the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks. Various
RAG paradigms, including vanilla, planning-based, and iterative RAG, are built
upon 2 cores: the retriever, which should robustly select relevant documents
across complex queries, and the generator, which should faithfully synthesize
responses. However, existing retrievers rely heavily on public knowledge and
struggle with queries of varying logical complexity and clue completeness,
while generators frequently face fidelity problems. In this work, we introduce
RAGSynth, a framework that includes a data construction modeling and a
corresponding synthetic data generation implementation, designed to optimize
retriever robustness and generator fidelity. Additionally, we present
SynthBench, a benchmark encompassing 8 domain-specific documents across 4
domains, featuring diverse query complexities, clue completeness, and
fine-grained citation granularity. Leveraging RAGSynth, we generate a
large-scale synthetic dataset, including single and multi-hop. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the synthetic data significantly improves the
robustness of the retrievers and the fidelity of the generators. Additional
evaluations confirm that RAGSynth can also generalize well across different
domains. By integrating the optimized retrievers into various RAG paradigms, we
consistently observe enhanced RAG system performance. We have open-sourced the
implementation on https://github.com/EachSheep/RAGSynth.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is critical for attaining trust in
the operation of AI systems. A key question of an AI system is ``why was this
decision made this way''. Formal approaches to XAI use a formal model of the AI
system to identify abductive explanations. While abductive explanations may be
applicable to a large number of inputs sharing the same concrete values, more
general explanations may be preferred for numeric inputs. So-called inflated
abductive explanations give intervals for each feature ensuring that any input
whose values fall withing these intervals is still guaranteed to make the same
prediction. Inflated explanations cover a larger portion of the input space,
and hence are deemed more general explanations. But there can be many
(inflated) abductive explanations for an instance. Which is the best? In this
paper, we show how to find a most general abductive explanation for an AI
decision. This explanation covers as much of the input space as possible, while
still being a correct formal explanation of the model's behaviour. Given that
we only want to give a human one explanation for a decision, the most general
explanation gives us the explanation with the broadest applicability, and hence
the one most likely to seem sensible. (The paper has been accepted at IJCAI2025

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强视觉语言模型（VLM）的安全性，通过推理提升防护模型的决策质量。

Method: 构建包含123K样本和631K推理步骤的数据集，通过监督微调（SFT）和在线强化学习（RL）训练模型，并采用动态剪裁参数和长度感知安全奖励优化性能。

Result: 模型在实验中表现优异，平均F1分数超过第二名19.27%。

Conclusion: GuardReasoner-VL在提升VLM安全性方面具有显著优势，相关数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: To enhance the safety of VLMs, this paper introduces a novel reasoning-based
VLM guard model dubbed GuardReasoner-VL. The core idea is to incentivize the
guard model to deliberatively reason before making moderation decisions via
online RL. First, we construct GuardReasoner-VLTrain, a reasoning corpus with
123K samples and 631K reasoning steps, spanning text, image, and text-image
inputs. Then, based on it, we cold-start our model's reasoning ability via SFT.
In addition, we further enhance reasoning regarding moderation through online
RL. Concretely, to enhance diversity and difficulty of samples, we conduct
rejection sampling followed by data augmentation via the proposed safety-aware
data concatenation. Besides, we use a dynamic clipping parameter to encourage
exploration in early stages and exploitation in later stages. To balance
performance and token efficiency, we design a length-aware safety reward that
integrates accuracy, format, and token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our model. Remarkably, it surpasses the runner-up by 19.27%
F1 score on average. We release data, code, and models (3B/7B) of
GuardReasoner-VL at https://github.com/yueliu1999/GuardReasoner-VL/

TL;DR: 论文提出Thought-Aligner，一个动态思想校正模块，用于提升LLM自主代理的行为安全性，通过实时修正高风险思想，将安全性从50%提升至90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM自主代理的思想偏差可能导致不可逆的安全事故，需解决长时行为轨迹中的安全对齐问题。

Method: 提出Thought-Aligner，利用轻量级模型实时修正高风险思想，采用对比学习技术训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，Thought-Aligner将行为安全性从50%提升至90%，响应延迟低于100ms。

Conclusion: Thought-Aligner为LLM代理提供了一种高效、广泛适用的动态安全解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based autonomous agents possess capabilities such as reasoning, tool
invocation, and environment interaction, enabling the execution of complex
multi-step tasks. The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral
trajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can
introduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may
trigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address
the safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we
propose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing
a lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each
high-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected
thought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions
and tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning
phase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy
and widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner
model, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios
and simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse
instructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is
fine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three
agent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that
Thought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the
unprotected setting to 90% on average. Additionally, Thought-Aligner maintains
response latency below 100ms with minimal resource usage, demonstrating its
capability for efficient deployment, broad applicability, and timely
responsiveness. This method thus provides a practical dynamic safety solution
for the LLM-based agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全渠道平台的兴起引发了对客户旅程的兴趣，但现有研究缺乏定量分析，尤其是序列数据的复杂性和顺序性。

Method: 提出三步法：1) 定义序列距离并可视化代表性序列；2) 基于距离预测购买概率；3) 对无购买序列推荐反事实序列以提升购买概率。

Result: 实验表明，典型序列可被提取，且能识别对购买重要的部分。

Conclusion: 该方法可支持营销活动的改进。

Abstract: Recently, the proliferation of omni-channel platforms has attracted interest
in customer journeys, particularly regarding their role in developing marketing
strategies. However, few efforts have been taken to quantitatively study or
comprehensively analyze them owing to the sequential nature of their data and
the complexity involved in analysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach
comprising three steps for analyzing customer journeys. First, the distance
between sequential data is defined and used to identify and visualize
representative sequences. Second, the likelihood of purchase is predicted based
on this distance. Third, if a sequence suggests no purchase, counterfactual
sequences are recommended to increase the probability of a purchase using a
proposed method, which extracts counterfactual explanations for sequential
data. A survey was conducted, and the data were analyzed; the results revealed
that typical sequences could be extracted, and the parts of those sequences
important for purchase could be detected. We believe that the proposed approach
can support improvements in various marketing activities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Group Think的新方法，通过单个大语言模型（LLM）模拟多个并发推理代理，实现动态协作，降低延迟并提高推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中多个推理代理通常以轮替方式交互，导致延迟增加。Group Think旨在通过并发推理减少冗余并提高效率。

Method: Group Think通过共享部分生成进度，实现多个推理轨迹在token级别的动态协作。例如，一个推理线程可以中途调整生成内容，以适应其他线程的进展。

Result: Group Think显著降低了延迟，提高了推理质量，并充分利用了空闲计算资源，尤其适用于边缘推理场景。

Conclusion: Group Think为未来LLM提供了更高效、更复杂的协作行为框架，有望推动高质量生成的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the power
of reasoning through self-generated chains of thought. Multiple reasoning
agents can collaborate to raise joint reasoning quality above individual
outcomes. However, such agents typically interact in a turn-based manner,
trading increased latency for improved quality. In this paper, we propose Group
Think--a single LLM that acts as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, or
thinkers. With shared visibility into each other's partial generation progress,
Group Think introduces a new concurrent-reasoning paradigm in which multiple
reasoning trajectories adapt dynamically to one another at the token level. For
example, a reasoning thread may shift its generation mid-sentence upon
detecting that another thread is better positioned to continue. This
fine-grained, token-level collaboration enables Group Think to reduce redundant
reasoning and improve quality while achieving significantly lower latency.
Moreover, its concurrent nature allows for efficient utilization of idle
computational resources, making it especially suitable for edge inference,
where very small batch size often underutilizes local~GPUs. We give a simple
and generalizable modification that enables any existing LLM to perform Group
Think on a local GPU. We also present an evaluation strategy to benchmark
reasoning latency and empirically demonstrate latency improvements using
open-source LLMs that were not explicitly trained for Group Think. We hope this
work paves the way for future LLMs to exhibit more sophisticated and more
efficient collaborative behavior for higher quality generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线教育环境中，数据质量差、规模有限和高度异质性阻碍了高级机器学习模型的应用，且教育理论缺乏可量化指标。

Method: 通过数据分析和教育文献综述，识别学生行为的突变作为辍学风险的早期信号，提出DMSW模型。

Result: DMSW模型比传统方法预测准确率提高15%，能更早识别高风险学生。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了理论与实践的差距，为教育者提供了创新工具，以提升学生保留率和学习成果。

Abstract: Timely prediction of students at high risk of dropout is critical for early
intervention and improving educational outcomes. However, in offline
educational settings, poor data quality, limited scale, and high heterogeneity
often hinder the application of advanced machine learning models. Furthermore,
while educational theories provide valuable insights into dropout phenomena,
the lack of quantifiable metrics for key indicators limits their use in
data-driven modeling. Through data analysis and a review of educational
literature, we identified abrupt changes in student behavior as key early
signals of dropout risk. To address this, we propose the Dual-Modal Multiscale
Sliding Window (DMSW) Model, which integrates academic performance and
behavioral data to dynamically capture behavior patterns using minimal data.
The DMSW model improves prediction accuracy by 15% compared to traditional
methods, enabling educators to identify high-risk students earlier, provide
timely support, and foster a more inclusive learning environment. Our analysis
highlights key behavior patterns, offering practical insights for preventive
strategies and tailored support. These findings bridge the gap between theory
and practice in dropout prediction, giving educators an innovative tool to
enhance student retention and outcomes.

Motivation: 传统Alpha因子挖掘依赖人工经验或自动化方法，但存在搜索效率低或因子可解释性差的问题。

Method: 结合LLM的指令遵循和推理能力，通过MCTS驱动的探索迭代生成和优化符号化Alpha公式，并利用金融回测反馈指导搜索。

Result: 在真实股票数据上，该框架挖掘的Alpha因子在预测准确性、交易表现和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为公式化Alpha挖掘提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Alpha factor mining is pivotal in quantitative investment for identifying
predictive signals from complex financial data. While traditional formulaic
alpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as
those based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often suffer from
search inefficiency or yield poorly interpretable alpha factors. This paper
introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. Our approach
leverages the LLM's instruction-following and reasoning capability to
iteratively generate and refine symbolic alpha formulas within an MCTS-driven
exploration. A key innovation is the guidance of MCTS exploration by rich,
quantitative feedback from financial backtesting of each candidate factor,
enabling efficient navigation of the vast search space. Furthermore, a frequent
subtree avoidance mechanism is introduced to bolster search efficiency and
alpha factor performance. Experimental results on real-world stock market data
demonstrate that our LLM-based framework outperforms existing methods by mining
alphas with superior predictive accuracy, trading performance, and improved
interpretability, while offering a more efficient solution for formulaic alpha
mining.

Motivation: 现有基准数据集（如Minifab或SMT2020）缺乏真实场景的复杂细节和约束，需改进以评估优化方法的适用性。

Method: 采用强化学习方法（策略梯度和进化策略），结合真实工业数据集和开源模型进行优化。

Result: 进化策略方法在真实数据集中提升4%的延迟和1%的吞吐量，在简单模型中提升更显著。

Conclusion: 进化策略方法在复杂场景中表现更优，且训练数据集多样性对泛化能力至关重要。

Abstract: Benchmark datasets are crucial for evaluating approaches to scheduling or
dispatching in the semiconductor industry during the development and deployment
phases. However, commonly used benchmark datasets like the Minifab or SMT2020
lack the complex details and constraints found in real-world scenarios. To
mitigate this shortcoming, we compare open-source simulation models with a real
industry dataset to evaluate how optimization methods scale with different
levels of complexity. Specifically, we focus on Reinforcement Learning methods,
performing optimization based on policy-gradient and Evolution Strategies. Our
research provides insights into the effectiveness of these optimization methods
and their applicability to realistic semiconductor frontend fab simulations. We
show that our proposed Evolution Strategies-based method scales much better
than a comparable policy-gradient-based approach. Moreover, we identify the
selection and combination of relevant bottleneck tools to control by the agent
as crucial for an efficient optimization. For the generalization across
different loading scenarios and stochastic tool failure patterns, we achieve
advantages when utilizing a diverse training dataset. While the overall
approach is computationally expensive, it manages to scale well with the number
of CPU cores used for training. For the real industry dataset, we achieve an
improvement of up to 4% regarding tardiness and up to 1% regarding throughput.
For the less complex open-source models Minifab and SMT2020, we observe
double-digit percentage improvement in tardiness and single digit percentage
improvement in throughput by use of Evolution Strategies.

Method: 扩展了SLAPStack仿真框架，提出了一种新的强化学习设计，并引入自适应启发式基线，使用PPO代理进行实验。

Result: 灵活的强化学习方法在服务时间上优于启发式策略，但存在收敛时间长和不稳定的问题；而引导式配置学习更稳定但泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 强化学习在充电策略优化中具有潜力，但需权衡灵活性与稳定性，未来可进一步探索设计配置的平衡。

Abstract: We propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) design to optimize the
charging strategy for autonomous mobile robots in large-scale block stacking
warehouses. RL design involves a wide array of choices that can mostly only be
evaluated through lengthy experimentation. Our study focuses on how different
reward and action space configurations, ranging from flexible setups to more
guided, domain-informed design configurations, affect the agent performance.
Using heuristic charging strategies as a baseline, we demonstrate the
superiority of flexible, RL-based approaches in terms of service times.
Furthermore, our findings highlight a trade-off: While more open-ended designs
are able to discover well-performing strategies on their own, they may require
longer convergence times and are less stable, whereas guided configurations
lead to a more stable learning process but display a more limited
generalization potential. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend
SLAPStack, an open-source, RL-compatible simulation-framework to accommodate
charging strategies. Second, we introduce a novel RL design for tackling the
charging strategy problem. Finally, we introduce several novel adaptive
baseline heuristics and reproducibly evaluate the design using a Proximal
Policy Optimization agent and varying different design configurations, with a
focus on reward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界组合零样本学习中，零样本预测器对所有可能的状态-对象组合表现不佳，需要外部辅助知识来判断其可行性。

Method: FLM通过查询LLM关于状态-对象组合的可行性，并提取正面答案的输出logit，同时利用LLM的上下文学习能力减少误导。

Result: 研究表明Vicuna和ChatGPT表现最佳，FLM在三个基准测试中均显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: FLM是一种简单有效的方法，利用LLM的语义理解能力显著改善了组合零样本学习的表现。

Abstract: Humans can easily tell if an attribute (also called state) is realistic,
i.e., feasible, for an object, e.g. fire can be hot, but it cannot be wet. In
Open-World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning, when all possible state-object
combinations are considered as unseen classes, zero-shot predictors tend to
perform poorly. Our work focuses on using external auxiliary knowledge to
determine the feasibility of state-object combinations. Our Feasibility with
Language Model (FLM) is a simple and effective approach that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to better comprehend the semantic relationships between
states and objects. FLM involves querying an LLM about the feasibility of a
given pair and retrieving the output logit for the positive answer. To mitigate
potential misguidance of the LLM given that many of the state-object
compositions are rare or completely infeasible, we observe that the in-context
learning ability of LLMs is essential. We present an extensive study
identifying Vicuna and ChatGPT as best performing, and we demonstrate that our
FLM consistently improves OW-CZSL performance across all three benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用全局XAI方法检测大型语言模型（LLM）中的偏见，提出了一种文本到序数的映射策略，并开发了RuleSHAP算法以提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI系统可能传播错误信息和偏见，影响联合国可持续发展目标（SDGs）。当前XAI工具难以处理LLM的非数值特性，因此需要改进方法。

Method: 通过文本到序数的映射策略将非数值输入/输出转换为数值特征，并注入不同复杂度的偏见（单变量、联合、非凸），使用全局XAI方法（如RuleFit和SHAP）检测。

Result: RuleFit对联合和非凸偏见效果不佳，SHAP能近似联合偏见但无法生成可操作规则。RuleSHAP结合两者，将偏见检测效果平均提升94%（MRR@1）。

Conclusion: RuleSHAP能更有效地检测LLM中的非单变量偏见，为XAI工具在复杂模型中的应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Generative AI systems can help spread information but also misinformation and
biases, potentially undermining the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Explainable AI (XAI) aims to reveal the inner workings of AI systems and expose
misbehaviours or biases. However, current XAI tools, built for simpler models,
struggle to handle the non-numerical nature of large language models (LLMs).
This paper examines the effectiveness of global XAI methods, such as
rule-extraction algorithms and SHAP, in detecting bias in LLMs. To do so, we
first show a text-to-ordinal mapping strategy to convert non-numerical
inputs/outputs into numerical features, enabling these tools to identify (some)
misinformation-related biases in LLM-generated content. Then, we inject
non-linear biases of varying complexity (univariate, conjunctive, and
non-convex) into widespread LLMs like ChatGPT and Llama via system
instructions, using global XAI methods to detect them. This way, we found that
RuleFit struggles with conjunctive and non-convex biases, while SHAP can
approximate conjunctive biases but cannot express them as actionable rules.
Hence, we introduce RuleSHAP, a global rule extraction algorithm combining SHAP
and RuleFit to detect more non-univariate biases, improving injected bias
detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在多模态、个性化和交互性方面的需求增加，现有方法（如FMs和FL）单独使用时无法满足复杂环境的需求，因此需要一种结合两者优势的新方法。

Method: 提出FFMs范式，结合FMs的多任务多模态能力和FL的分布式隐私保护特性，并定义了EMBODY框架，涵盖部署中的关键维度。

Result: 论文提出了FFMs的概念和EMBODY框架，明确了具体挑战和研究方向，并设计了评估框架。

Conclusion: FFMs为具身AI提供了一种新的解决方案，结合了通用性和隐私保护，未来研究可基于EMBODY框架展开。

Abstract: As embodied AI systems become increasingly multi-modal, personalized, and
interactive, they must learn effectively from diverse sensory inputs, adapt
continually to user preferences, and operate safely under resource and privacy
constraints. These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning
models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model
generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable
candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs)
provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas
Federated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed,
privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However,
when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the
complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied
environments. In this vision paper, we introduce Federated Foundation Models
(FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed nature
of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical
deployment dimensions of FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified
framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness
and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning,
Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and
personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision
actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for
deploying FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs.

Result: 相比现有技术，GLOVA在样本效率上提升了80.5倍，时间效率提升了76倍。

Conclusion: GLOVA有效解决了PVT变化带来的挑战，显著提升了设计效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuit design encounters significant challenges due to
performance degradation from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT)
variations. To achieve commercial-grade reliability, iterative manual design
revisions and extensive statistical simulations are required. While several
studies have aimed to automate variation aware analog design to reduce
time-to-market, the substantial mismatches in real-world wafers have not been
thoroughly addressed. In this paper, we present GLOVA, an analog circuit sizing
framework that effectively manages the impact of diverse random mismatches to
improve robustness against PVT variations. In the proposed approach,
risk-sensitive reinforcement learning is leveraged to account for the
reliability bound affected by PVT variations, and ensemble-based critic is
introduced to achieve sample-efficient learning. For design verification, we
also propose $\mu$-$\sigma$ evaluation and simulation reordering method to
reduce simulation costs of identifying failed designs. GLOVA supports
verification through industrial-level PVT variation evaluation methods,
including corner simulation as well as global and local Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations. Compared to previous state-of-the-art variation-aware analog
sizing frameworks, GLOVA achieves up to 80.5$\times$ improvement in sample
efficiency and 76.0$\times$ reduction in time.

Motivation: 探索纯RL训练是否足以提升语言模型的推理能力，挑战PRM的必要性。

Method: 通过纯RL训练和提出的Self-PRM框架，评估模型在数学问题解决和过程监督中的表现。

Result: 纯RL训练不仅提升问题解决能力，还增强了PRM能力；Self-PRM在复杂问题上精度低。

Conclusion: PRM对复杂推理可能非必需，RL训练能同时提升推理和PRM能力，未来需进一步优化奖励对齐。

Abstract: The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in
large language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and
process reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological
frameworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical
problem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM
integration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In
this study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between
RL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving
proficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary
dimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training.
In particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting
when applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To
address this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in
which models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through
self-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of
the benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes
persistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\%) on difficult
problems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses
underscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and
introspective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be
essential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves
problem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We
hope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and
self-aware complex reasoning models.

Conclusion: LD-Scene提供细粒度控制，支持针对特定场景的有效测试。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems necessitates
a comprehensive evaluation in safety-critical scenarios. However, these
safety-critical scenarios are rare and difficult to collect from real-world
driving data, posing significant challenges to effectively assessing the
performance of autonomous vehicles. Typical existing methods often suffer from
limited controllability and lack user-friendliness, as extensive expert
knowledge is essentially required. To address these challenges, we propose
LD-Scene, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for user-controllable adversarial scenario
generation through natural language. Our approach comprises an LDM that
captures realistic driving trajectory distributions and an LLM-based guidance
module that translates user queries into adversarial loss functions,
facilitating the generation of scenarios aligned with user queries. The

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SelfBudgeter是一种自适应的可控推理策略，通过双阶段训练和预算引导的GPRO强化学习，优化推理效率，减少资源浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在处理简单和复杂查询时效率低下、资源浪费和用户延迟的问题。

Method: 采用双阶段训练：先预估计查询难度，再引入预算引导的GPRO强化学习，控制推理长度。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，实现了74.47%的响应长度压缩，同时保持几乎不变的准确性。

Conclusion: SelfBudgeter能根据问题复杂度合理分配预算，显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on
various tasks. However, reasoning models inefficiently over-process both
trivial and complex queries, leading to resource waste and prolonged user
latency. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a self-adaptive
controllable reasoning strategy for efficient reasoning. Our approach adopts a
dual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the
reasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce
budget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains
accuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate
generation time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting
the process. Furthermore, our method enables direct manipulation of reasoning
length via pre-filling token budget. Experimental results demonstrate that
SelfBudgeter can rationally allocate budgets according to problem complexity,
achieving up to 74.47% response length compression on the MATH benchmark while
maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.

### [63] [Extracting Explainable Dates From Medical Images By Reverse-Engineering UNIX Timestamps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11451)
*Lee Harris,James Bentham,Philippe De Wilde*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何从文本中提取日期数据，比较了手动和自动生成正则表达式的方法，发现正则表达式合成方法能更准确地识别复杂日期和日期范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日期数据对医疗决策至关重要，但现有方法（如复杂AI模型或正则表达式）在提取日期时存在局限性，需要更精确且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 测试了公开可用的正则表达式，手动创建易分解的正则表达式，并使用正则表达式合成技术自动生成正则表达式。

Result: 合成生成的正则表达式能更准确地识别日期，减少误报，但略微增加了漏报率。

Conclusion: 正则表达式合成是一种有效的方法，可用于识别复杂日期和日期范围，且该方法是一种新的确定性逻辑学习方式。

Abstract: Dates often contribute towards highly impactful medical decisions, but it is
rarely clear how to extract this data. AI has only just begun to be used
transcribe such documents, and common methods are either to trust that the
output produced by a complex AI model, or to parse the text using regular
expressions. Recent work has established that regular expressions are an
explainable form of logic, but it is difficult to decompose these into the
component parts that are required to construct precise UNIX timestamps. First,
we test publicly-available regular expressions, and we found that these were
unable to capture a significant number of our dates. Next, we manually created
easily-decomposable regular expressions, and we found that these were able to
detect the majority of real dates, but also a lot of sequences of text that
look like dates. Finally, we used regular expression synthesis to automatically
identify regular expressions from the reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps that
we created. We find that regular expressions created by regular expression
synthesis detect far fewer sequences of text that look like dates than those
that were manually created, at the cost of a slight increase to the number of
missed dates. Overall, our results show that regular expressions can be created
through regular expression synthesis to identify complex dates and date ranges
in text transcriptions. To our knowledge, our proposed way of learning
deterministic logic by reverse-engineering several many-one mappings and
feeding these into a regular expression synthesiser is a new approach.

Result: 在12个存在混杂偏差的Atari游戏中，新算法始终优于标准DQN。

Conclusion: 新算法在未观测混杂偏差存在时表现更优，适用于复杂高维环境。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Conclusion: MOSAAIC为人类与AI协同创作中的控制权平衡提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SSOCL的双层自监督持续学习框架，用于解决生理信号（如EEG）情感识别中的跨主体差异和噪声标签问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号（如EEG）的情感识别存在跨主体差异和噪声标签问题，现有方法难以处理连续流式无标记数据。

Method: 提出双层自监督持续学习框架SSOCL，基于动态记忆缓冲区迭代优化伪标签分配，并结合快速适应模块和聚类映射模块。

Result: 在两个主流EEG任务上的实验验证表明，SSOCL能适应连续数据流并保持跨主体泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSOCL框架有效解决了生理信号情感识别中的挑战，为连续无标记数据流提供了鲁棒的学习方案。

Abstract: Emotion recognition through physiological signals such as
electroencephalogram (EEG) has become an essential aspect of affective
computing and provides an objective way to capture human emotions. However,
physiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels
hinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain
adaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues,
especially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and
unlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level
self-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory
buffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and
pseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling
generalization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for
emotion recognition. The assigned pseudo-labels are subsequently leveraged for
accurate emotion prediction. Key components of the framework, including a fast
adaptation module and a cluster-mapping module, enable robust learning and
effective handling of evolving data streams. Experimental validation on two
mainstream EEG tasks demonstrates the framework's ability to adapt to
continuous data streams while maintaining strong generalization across
subjects, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Over the past decades, computer-aided diagnosis tools for breast cancer have
been developed to enhance screening procedures, yet their clinical adoption
remains challenged by data variability and inherent biases. Although foundation
models (FMs) have recently demonstrated impressive generalizability and
transfer learning capabilities by leveraging vast and diverse datasets, their
performance can be undermined by spurious correlations that arise from
variations in image quality, labeling uncertainty, and sensitive patient
attributes. In this work, we explore the fairness and bias of FMs for breast
mammography classification by leveraging a large pool of datasets from diverse
sources-including data from underrepresented regions and an in-house dataset.
Our extensive experiments show that while modality-specific pre-training of FMs
enhances performance, classifiers trained on features from individual datasets
fail to generalize across domains. Aggregating datasets improves overall
performance, yet does not fully mitigate biases, leading to significant
disparities across under-represented subgroups such as extreme breast densities
and age groups. Furthermore, while domain-adaptation strategies can reduce
these disparities, they often incur a performance trade-off. In contrast,
fairness-aware techniques yield more stable and equitable performance across
subgroups. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating rigorous
fairness evaluations and mitigation strategies into FM-based models to foster
inclusive and generalizable AI.

Motivation: 研究多模态模型中视觉与文本模态是否共享潜在空间，验证其对齐性。

Method: 使用机器教学理论，对比图像（位图）和坐标（TikZ格式）两种表示方式在Quick, Draw!数据集上的教学效果。

Result: 图像表示通常需要更少教学片段且准确率更高，但两种模态对概念的教学复杂度排序相似。

Conclusion: 概念的简单性可能是跨模态的固有属性，与表示方式无关。

Abstract: Large language models have become multimodal, and many of them are said to
integrate their modalities using common representations. If this were true, a
drawing of a car as an image, for instance, should map to the similar area in
the latent space as a textual description of the strokes that conform the
drawing. To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we
propose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of
examples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In
this paper we evaluate the complexity of teaching visual-language models a
subset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw
images as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate
that image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve
higher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the
teaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even
when controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the
simplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality
representations.

Abstract: Malicious Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present a significant threat to
next-generation networks (NGNs), posing risks such as unauthorized
surveillance, data theft, and the delivery of hazardous materials. This paper
proposes an integrated (AE)-classifier system to detect malicious UAVs. The
proposed AE, based on a 4-layer Tri-orientated Spatial Mamba (TSMamba)
architecture, effectively captures complex spatial relationships crucial for
identifying malicious UAV activities. The first phase involves generating
residual values through the AE, which are subsequently processed by a
ResNet-based classifier. This classifier leverages the residual values to
achieve lower complexity and higher accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in both binary and multi-class classification
scenarios, achieving up to 99.8 % recall compared to 96.7 % in the benchmark.
Additionally, our method reduces computational complexity, making it more
suitable for large-scale deployment. These results highlight the robustness and
scalability of our approach, offering an effective solution for malicious UAV
detection in NGN environments.

Conclusion: MoMADiff通过创新框架解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了高质量的文本到运动生成。

Abstract: Generating 3D human motion from text descriptions remains challenging due to
the diverse and complex nature of human motion. While existing methods excel
within the training distribution, they often struggle with out-of-distribution
motions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Existing
VQVAE-based methods often fail to represent novel motions faithfully using
discrete tokens, which hampers their ability to generalize beyond seen data.
Meanwhile, diffusion-based methods operating on continuous representations
often lack fine-grained control over individual frames. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust motion generation framework MoMADiff, which
combines masked modeling with diffusion processes to generate motion using
frame-level continuous representations. Our model supports flexible
user-provided keyframe specification, enabling precise control over both
spatial and temporal aspects of motion synthesis. MoMADiff demonstrates strong
generalization capability on novel text-to-motion datasets with sparse
keyframes as motion prompts. Extensive experiments on two held-out datasets and
two standard benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in motion quality, instruction fidelity, and keyframe
adherence.

Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by
extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution
Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal
data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design
does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To
address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is
proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both
spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is
developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation
techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local
and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and
maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general
structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and
one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between
performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal
coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional
single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical,
learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential
applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.

Abstract: Determining the shelf life quality of pineapples using non-destructive

multimodal and multiview classification model was constructed to classify
pineapples into four quality levels based on audio and visual characteristics.
For research purposes, we compiled and released the PQC500 dataset consisting
of 500 pineapples with two modalities: one was tapping pineapples to record
sounds by multiple microphones and the other was taking pictures by multiple
cameras at different locations, providing multimodal and multi-view audiovisual
features. We modified the contrastive audiovisual masked autoencoder to train
the cross-modal-based classification model by abundant combinations of audio
and visual pairs. In addition, we proposed to sample a compact size of training
data for efficient computation. The experiments were evaluated under various
data and model configurations, and the results demonstrated that the proposed
cross-modal model trained using audio-major sampling can yield 84% accuracy,
outperforming the unimodal models of only audio and only visual by 6% and 18%,
respectively.

Conclusion: ARFC-WAHNet通过自适应特征提取和多模块协作，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is critical in both civilian and
military applications. However, the limited texture and structural information
in infrared images makes accurate detection particularly challenging. Although
recent deep learning-based methods have improved performance, their use of
conventional convolution kernels limits adaptability to complex scenes and
diverse targets. Moreover, pooling operations often cause feature loss and
insufficient exploitation of image information. To address these issues, we
propose an adaptive receptive field convolution and wavelet-attentive
hierarchical network for infrared small target detection (ARFC-WAHNet). This
network incorporates a multi-receptive field feature interaction convolution
(MRFFIConv) module to adaptively extract discriminative features by integrating
multiple convolutional branches with a gated unit. A wavelet frequency
enhancement downsampling (WFED) module leverages Haar wavelet transform and
frequency-domain reconstruction to enhance target features and suppress
background noise. Additionally, we introduce a high-low feature fusion (HLFF)
module for integrating low-level details with high-level semantics, and a
global median enhancement attention (GMEA) module to improve feature diversity
and expressiveness via global attention. Experiments on public datasets SIRST,
NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k demonstrate that ARFC-WAHNet outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and robustness,
particularly under complex backgrounds. The code is available at

Conclusion: SRMamba有效解决了稀疏场景中LiDAR点云超分辨率的3D空间结构恢复问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, range-view-based LiDAR point cloud super-resolution
techniques attract significant attention as a low-cost method for generating
higher-resolution point cloud data. However, due to the sparsity and irregular
structure of LiDAR point clouds, the point cloud super-resolution problem
remains a challenging topic, especially for point cloud upsampling under novel
views. In this paper, we propose SRMamba, a novel method for super-resolution
of LiDAR point clouds in sparse scenes, addressing the key challenge of
recovering the 3D spatial structure of point clouds from novel views.
Specifically, we implement projection technique based on Hough Voting and Hole
Compensation strategy to eliminate horizontally linear holes in range image. To
improve the establishment of long-distance dependencies and to focus on
potential geometric features in vertical 3D space, we employ Visual State Space
model and Multi-Directional Scanning mechanism to mitigate the loss of 3D
spatial structural information due to the range image. Additionally, an
asymmetric U-Net network adapts to the input characteristics of LiDARs with
different beam counts, enabling super-resolution reconstruction for multi-beam
point clouds. We conduct a series of experiments on multiple challenging public
LiDAR datasets (SemanticKITTI and nuScenes), and SRMamba demonstrates
significant superiority over other algorithms in both qualitative and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在物体属性识别和空间关系推理方面存在显著不足，限制了动态推理能力。

Method: 提出MIRAGE基准，通过多样复杂场景测试模型的计数、关系推理及其组合能力。

Result: MIRAGE揭示了当前先进模型在细粒度识别和推理方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: MIRAGE为未来时空推理研究提供了改进方向和基准支持。

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are core components of human cognition,
encompassing object recognition, spatial relational understanding, and dynamic
reasoning. Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal
significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes
and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning.
To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark
designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute
recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with
Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained
recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in
state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and
reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE
provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.

Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对封闭集，缺乏多语言和开放集场景的基准，因此提出MAVOS-DD数据集填补这一空白。

Method: 数据集包含8种语言的真实和伪造视频，伪造视频由7种不同生成模型生成。训练、验证和测试集仅包含部分生成模型和语言，以模拟开放集场景。

Result: 实验显示，现有先进检测器在开放集场景下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: MAVOS-DD数据集为多语言开放集深度伪造检测提供了新基准，现有检测器需进一步改进以适应开放集挑战。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale open-set benchmark for multilingual
audio-video deepfake detection. Our dataset comprises over 250 hours of real

each language, the fake videos are generated with seven distinct deepfake
generation models, selected based on the quality of the generated content. We
organize the training, validation and test splits such that only a subset of
the chosen generative models and languages are available during training, thus
creating several challenging open-set evaluation setups. We perform experiments
with various pre-trained and fine-tuned deepfake detectors proposed in recent
literature. Our results show that state-of-the-art detectors are not currently
able to maintain their performance levels when tested in our open-set
scenarios. We publicly release our data and code at:

TL;DR: MMLongBench是首个针对长上下文视觉语言模型（LCVLMs）的多样化基准测试，涵盖13,331个示例和五种任务类别，评估了46个模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长上下文视觉语言模型的发展，需要全面评估其能力的基准测试。

Method: MMLongBench通过跨模态标记化方案，提供五种标准化输入长度（8K-128K标记）的任务示例，覆盖多种图像类型。

Result: 评估显示：单任务性能不能代表整体能力；开源和闭源模型均面临挑战；推理能力强的模型表现更好。

Conclusion: MMLongBench为诊断和推进下一代LCVLMs提供了基础。

Abstract: The rapid extension of context windows in large vision-language models has
given rise to long-context vision-language models (LCVLMs), which are capable
of handling hundreds of images with interleaved text tokens in a single forward
pass. In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a
diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs
effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning
five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot
ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural
and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input
lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K
tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and
text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and
open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models'
vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on
a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both
closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context
vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii)
models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context
performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous
length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and
advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.

*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CICD的训练无关方法，通过跨图像对比解码缓解大型视觉语言模型中的语言先验问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言先验是大型视觉语言模型产生幻觉内容的主要原因之一，导致模型生成视觉不一致但语言合理的内容。

Method: CICD通过识别关键和有害的先验，并利用对比解码消除有害先验，同时保持文本流畅性和连贯性。

Result: 在四个基准测试和六个LVLM上验证了CICD的有效性，尤其在图像描述任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CICD能有效缓解语言先验问题，同时避免视觉信息丢失。

Abstract: Language priors constitute one of the primary causes of hallucinations in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driving the models to generate
linguistically plausible yet visually inconsistent content. The language priors
in LVLMs originate from the linguistic knowledge inherited from their
pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) backbone. Consequently, this
characteristic is an intrinsic property of the model that remains independent
of visual inputs. Inspired by the finding that language priors are consistent
across images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet
effective training-free method to alleviate language priors in LVLMs. CICD
first identifies essential and detrimental priors, and then employs contrastive
decoding to eliminate the detrimental ones. This approach simultaneously
prevents LVLMs from generating hallucinated content while maintaining textual
fluency and coherence. Furthermore, the limited information overlap between
images helps prevent visual information loss during contrastive decoding. We
validate the effectiveness of CICD on four benchmarks with six LVLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate that CICD performs remarkably well in mitigating
language priors, especially in the image captioning task, where such priors are
most pronounced. Code will be released once accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL模型在持续学习中适应性差，无法有效整合新数据，且现有CL方法改进有限。

Method: 分析CL在注意力MIL模型中的遗忘问题，提出AKD和PMP组件，分别用于保留注意力层知识和选择性存储信息丰富的伪袋。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样WSI数据集上显著提高了准确性和内存效率，优于现有CL方法。

Conclusion: 为大规模弱标注临床数据集中的CL提供了基础，推动了更适应性强且稳健的诊断模型的发展。

Abstract: Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in
whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing
promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL
models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static
training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining.
Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but
often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of
attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated
in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we
propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge
Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates
catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge
between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by
selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from
WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly
improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets,
outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a
foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving
the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证AI生成图像的真实性日益重要，但现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在预训练中缺乏相关标签，其分类能力未被充分探索。

Method: 使用冻结的CLIP模型提取视觉嵌入，通过轻量级网络和微调最终分类器进行分类。

Result: 在CIFAKE基准测试中达到95%准确率，少量数据微调后为85%。某些图像类型（如广角照片和油画）分类困难。

Conclusion: CLIP嵌入可用于AI生成图像分类，但特定类型图像仍具挑战性，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Verifying the authenticity of AI-generated images presents a growing
challenge on social media platforms these days. While vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP outdo in multimodal representation, their capacity for
AI-generated image classification is underexplored due to the absence of such
labels during the pre-training process. This work investigates whether CLIP
embeddings inherently contain information indicative of AI generation. A
proposed pipeline extracts visual embeddings using a frozen CLIP model, feeds
its embeddings to lightweight networks, and fine-tunes only the final
classifier. Experiments on the public CIFAKE benchmark show the performance
reaches 95% accuracy without language reasoning. Few-shot adaptation to curated
custom with 20% of the data results in performance to 85%. A closed-source
baseline (Gemini-2.0) has the best zero-shot accuracy yet fails on specific
styles. Notably, some specific image types, such as wide-angle photographs and
oil paintings, pose significant challenges to classification. These results
indicate previously unexplored difficulties in classifying certain types of
AI-generated images, revealing new and more specific questions in this domain
that are worth further investigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的3D视线估计方法GA3CE，通过学习主体与场景中物体的空间关系来输出3D视线方向，适用于无约束场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无约束场景中（如主体距离远或背对摄像头）从2D观测估计3D视线方向的挑战，现有方法依赖2D外观或有限的空间线索。

Method: 使用3D姿态和物体位置表示主体和场景，将其作为3D上下文学习空间关系，并在自我中心空间对齐以减少复杂性，提出D$^3$位置编码以捕捉方向-距离空间关系。

Result: 在单帧设置下，相比基线方法，平均角度误差减少了13%-37%。

Conclusion: GA3CE通过3D上下文学习和空间对齐，显著提升了3D视线估计的准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze estimation approach that learns spatial
relationships between the subject and objects in the scene, and outputs 3D gaze
direction. Our method targets unconstrained settings, including cases where
close-up views of the subject's eyes are unavailable, such as when the subject
is distant or facing away. Previous approaches typically rely on either 2D
appearance alone or incorporate limited spatial cues using depth maps in the
non-learnable post-processing step. Estimating 3D gaze direction from 2D
observations in these scenarios is challenging; variations in subject pose,
scene layout, and gaze direction, combined with differing camera poses, yield
diverse 2D appearances and 3D gaze directions even when targeting the same 3D
scene. To address this issue, we propose GA3CE: Gaze-Aware 3D Context Encoding.
Our method represents subject and scene using 3D poses and object positions,
treating them as 3D context to learn spatial relationships in 3D space.
Inspired by human vision, we align this context in an egocentric space,
significantly reducing spatial complexity. Furthermore, we propose D$^3$
(direction-distance-decomposed) positional encoding to better capture the
spatial relationship between 3D context and gaze direction in direction and
distance space. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, reducing mean
angle error by 13%-37% compared to leading baselines on benchmark datasets in
single-frame settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ST-GCNs在骨架动作识别中性能相近，表明模型可能过参数化，需探索更高效的稀疏结构。

Method: 提出稀疏ST-GCNs生成器，从随机初始化的密集网络中训练稀疏架构，并集成多级稀疏结构。

Result: 稀疏ST-GCNs在减少95%参数时性能下降<1%，多级稀疏ST-GCNs仅需66%参数且性能提升>1%。

Conclusion: 稀疏ST-GCNs能显著减少参数并保持或提升性能，为高效动作识别提供新方向。

Abstract: Spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) showcase impressive
performance in skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR). However, despite
the development of numerous models, their recognition performance does not
differ significantly after aligning the input settings. With this observation,
we hypothesize that ST-GCNs are over-parameterized for HAR, a conjecture
subsequently confirmed through experiments employing the lottery ticket
hypothesis. Additionally, a novel sparse ST-GCNs generator is proposed, which
trains a sparse architecture from a randomly initialized dense network while
maintaining comparable performance levels to the dense components. Moreover, we
generate multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs by integrating sparse structures at
various sparsity levels and demonstrate that the assembled model yields a
significant enhancement in HAR performance. Thorough experiments on four
datasets, including NTU-RGB+D 60(120), Kinetics-400, and FineGYM, demonstrate
that the proposed sparse ST-GCNs can achieve comparable performance to their
dense components. Even with 95% fewer parameters, the sparse ST-GCNs exhibit a
degradation of <1% in top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-level sparsity
ST-GCNs, which require only 66% of the parameters of the dense ST-GCNs,
demonstrate an improvement of >1% in top-1 accuracy. The code is available at

Conclusion: GaussianFormer3D在多模态融合方法中表现出色，为3D语义占用预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for achieving safe and reliable
autonomous driving. Compared to camera-only perception systems, multi-modal
pipelines, especially LiDAR-camera fusion methods, can produce more accurate
and detailed predictions. Although most existing works utilize a dense
grid-based representation, in which the entire 3D space is uniformly divided
into discrete voxels, the emergence of 3D Gaussians provides a compact and
continuous object-centric representation. In this work, we propose a
multi-modal Gaussian-based semantic occupancy prediction framework utilizing 3D
deformable attention, named as GaussianFormer3D. We introduce a
voxel-to-Gaussian initialization strategy to provide 3D Gaussians with geometry
priors from LiDAR data, and design a LiDAR-guided 3D deformable attention
mechanism for refining 3D Gaussians with LiDAR-camera fusion features in a
lifted 3D space. We conducted extensive experiments on both on-road and
off-road datasets, demonstrating that our GaussianFormer3D achieves high
prediction accuracy that is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-modal
fusion-based methods with reduced memory consumption and improved efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and aerial imaging have transformed
wildlife monitoring, enabling researchers to survey wildlife populations at
unprecedented scales. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide a cost-effective
means of capturing high-resolution imagery, particularly for monitoring densely
populated seabird colonies. In this study, we assess the performance of a
general-purpose avian detection model, BirdDetector, in estimating the breeding
population of Salvin's albatross (Thalassarche salvini) on the Bounty Islands,
New Zealand. Using drone-derived imagery, we evaluate the model's effectiveness
in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, incorporating enhanced inference
techniques and stronger augmentation methods. Our findings indicate that while
applying the model in a zero-shot setting offers a strong baseline, fine-tuning
with annotations from the target domain and stronger image augmentation leads
to marked improvements in detection accuracy. These results highlight the
potential of leveraging pre-trained deep-learning models for species-specific
monitoring in remote and challenging environments.

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）使用未修改的SDXL生成通用场景；2）通过分割驱动的图像到图像流程选择性插入个性化主题。

Result: 在SDXL上DINO相似性得分为0.789，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效分离主题编码与整体构图，保留了模型的生成能力并实现高保真个性化。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable
Diffusion, have enabled the generation of highly detailed and semantically rich
images. However, personalizing these models to represent novel subjects based
on a few reference images remains challenging. This often leads to catastrophic
forgetting, overfitting, or large computational overhead.We propose a two-stage
pipeline that addresses these limitations by leveraging LoRA-based fine-tuning
on the attention weights within the U-Net of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)
model. First, we use the unmodified SDXL to generate a generic scene by
replacing the subject with its class label. Then, we selectively insert the
personalized subject through a segmentation-driven image-to-image (Img2Img)
pipeline that uses the trained LoRA weights.This framework isolates the subject
encoding from the overall composition, thus preserving SDXL's broader
generative capabilities while integrating the new subject in a high-fidelity
manner. Our method achieves a DINO similarity score of 0.789 on SDXL,
outperforming existing personalized text-to-image approaches.

Abstract: Although the use of remote sensing technologies for monitoring forested
environments has gained increasing attention, publicly available point cloud
datasets remain scarce due to the high costs, sensor requirements, and
time-intensive nature of their acquisition. Moreover, as far as we are aware,
there are no public annotated datasets generated through Structure From Motion
(SfM) algorithms applied to imagery, which may be due to the lack of SfM
algorithms that can map semantic segmentation information into an accurate
point cloud, especially in a challenging environment like forests.
  In this work, we present a novel pipeline for generating semantically
segmented point clouds of forest environments. Using a custom-built forest
simulator, we generate realistic RGB images of diverse forest scenes along with
their corresponding semantic segmentation masks. These labeled images are then
processed using modified open-source SfM software capable of preserving
semantic information during 3D reconstruction. The resulting point clouds
provide both geometric and semantic detail, offering a valuable resource for
training and evaluating deep learning models aimed at segmenting real forest
point clouds obtained via SfM.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) presents significant visual and technical
challenges, including surgical instrument classification and understanding
surgical action involving instruments, verbs, and anatomical targets. While
many machine learning-based methods have been developed for surgical
understanding, they typically rely on procedure- and task-specific models
trained on small, manually annotated datasets. In contrast, the recent success
of vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large volumes of raw image-text
pairs has demonstrated strong adaptability to diverse visual data and a range
of downstream tasks. This opens meaningful research questions: how well do
these general-purpose VLMs perform in the surgical domain? In this work, we
explore those questions by benchmarking several VLMs across diverse surgical
datasets, including general laparoscopic procedures and endoscopic submucosal
dissection, to assess their current capabilities and limitations. Our benchmark
reveals key gaps in the models' ability to consistently link language to the
correct regions in surgical scenes.

Motivation: 现有生物医学图像分割模型在未见域数据上表现不佳，缺乏视觉-语言知识（VLK）是主要原因。MLLMs的多模态理解和推理能力为解决这一问题提供了灵感。

Method: 提出Vision-Language Semantic Alignment（VLSA）模块，将VLK注入SAM；并设计Semantic Boundary Regularization（SBR）以优化边界感知。

Result: 在9个域内显微镜数据集上，Dice和SA分别提升7.71%和12.10%；在10个域外数据集上，分别提升6.79%和10.08%。

Conclusion: uLLSAM通过结合MLLMs和SAM，显著提升了跨域分割性能，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of regions of interest in biomedical images holds
substantial value in image analysis. Although several foundation models for
biomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on
certain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen
domain data. We owe the deficiency to lack of vision-language knowledge before
segmentation. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding
understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us
to leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling
vision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on
cross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose using MLLMs to guide SAM in
learning microscopy crose-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy,
named uLLSAM. Specifically, we propose the Vision-Language Semantic Alignment
(VLSA) module, which injects VLK into Segment Anything Model (SAM). We find
that after SAM receives global VLK prompts, its performance improves
significantly, but there are deficiencies in boundary contour perception.
Therefore, we further propose Semantic Boundary Regularization (SBR) to prompt
SAM. Our method achieves performance improvements of 7.71% in Dice and 12.10%
in SA across 9 in-domain microscopy datasets, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Our method also demonstrates improvements of 6.79% in Dice and
10.08% in SA across 10 out-ofdomain datasets, exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ieellee/uLLSAM.

Abstract: This work addresses the task of completely weakly supervised
class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation to learn segmentation for
both base and additional novel classes using only image-level labels. While
class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse
and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require
expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation,
partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely
weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate
robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence
of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation
method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes
with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental
settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint
and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly
supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the
15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the
COCO-to-VOC setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集无法满足铁路安全研究中高质量、多样化障碍物检测的需求，阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 采用扩散模型生成难以捕捉的障碍物，构建SynRailObs数据集，并在真实铁路环境中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，基于SynRailObs训练的模型在不同距离和环境条件下表现稳定，并具备零样本能力。

Conclusion: SynRailObs在铁路安全应用中具有显著潜力，可推动障碍物检测技术的发展。

Abstract: Detecting potential obstacles in railway environments is critical for
preventing serious accidents. Identifying a broad range of obstacle categories
under complex conditions requires large-scale datasets with precisely
annotated, high-quality images. However, existing publicly available datasets
fail to meet these requirements, thereby hindering progress in railway safety
research. To address this gap, we introduce SynRailObs, a high-fidelity
synthetic dataset designed to represent a diverse range of weather conditions
and geographical features. Furthermore, diffusion models are employed to
generate rare and difficult-to-capture obstacles that are typically challenging
to obtain in real-world scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SynRailObs,
we perform experiments in real-world railway environments, testing on both
ballasted and ballastless tracks across various weather conditions. The results
demonstrate that SynRailObs holds substantial potential for advancing obstacle
detection in railway safety applications. Models trained on this dataset show
consistent performance across different distances and environmental conditions.
Moreover, the model trained on SynRailObs exhibits zero-shot capabilities,
which are essential for applications in security-sensitive domains. The data is
available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qiushi910/synrailobs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EA-3DGS是一种针对户外场景的高质量实时渲染方法，通过引入网格结构和高效高斯修剪策略，解决了3D高斯点云在户外场景中的内存和调整问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NeRF方法在建筑场景重建中表现优秀但速度慢，而3D高斯点云方法在户外场景中因缺乏调整机制和内存限制表现不佳。

Method: 提出EA-3DGS，结合自适应四面体网格初始化高斯组件，采用高效修剪和结构感知密集化策略，并使用向量量化减少存储需求。

Result: 在13个场景（包括公开数据集和自采集数据）上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: EA-3DGS在户外场景中实现了高质量实时渲染，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Efficient scene representations are essential for many real-world
applications, especially those involving spatial measurement. Although current
NeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing
building-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference
speeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality
rendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes.
However, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an
effective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required
often lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges,
we propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for
outdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the
initialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral
mesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face,
effectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions. Second, we
propose an efficient Gaussian pruning strategy that evaluates each 3D
Gaussian's contribution to the view and prunes accordingly. To retain
geometry-critical Gaussian points, we also present a structure-aware
densification strategy that densifies Gaussian points in low-curvature regions.
Additionally, we employ vector quantization for parameter quantization of
Gaussian components, significantly reducing disk space requirements with only a
minimal impact on rendering quality. Extensive experiments on 13 scenes,
including eight from four public datasets (MatrixCity-Aerial, Mill-19, Tanks \&
Temples, WHU) and five self-collected scenes acquired through UAV
photogrammetry measurement from SCUT-CA and plateau regions, further
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Conclusion: MoCLIP是一个多功能且有效的框架，能够显著提升运动生成的质量和兼容性。

Abstract: Human motion generation is essential for fields such as animation, robotics,
and virtual reality, requiring models that effectively capture motion dynamics
from text descriptions. Existing approaches often rely on Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based text encoders, but their training on
text-image pairs constrains their ability to understand temporal and kinematic
structures inherent in motion and motion generation. This work introduces
MoCLIP, a fine-tuned CLIP model with an additional motion encoding head,
trained on motion sequences using contrastive learning and tethering loss. By
explicitly incorporating motion-aware representations, MoCLIP enhances motion
fidelity while remaining compatible with existing CLIP-based pipelines and
seamlessly integrating into various CLIP-based methods. Experiments demonstrate
that MoCLIP improves Top-1, Top-2, and Top-3 accuracy while maintaining
competitive FID, leading to improved text-to-motion alignment results. These
results highlight MoCLIP's versatility and effectiveness, establishing it as a
robust framework for enhancing motion generation.

Result: MedImageInsight嵌入+SVM适配器表现最佳（mAUC 93.8%），计算高效且公平性良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型嵌入（尤其是MedImageInsight）支持高效、准确且公平的放射学分类。

Abstract: Foundation models, pretrained on extensive datasets, have significantly
advanced machine learning by providing robust and transferable embeddings
applicable to various domains, including medical imaging diagnostics. This
study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from both general-purpose and
medical domain-specific foundation models for training lightweight adapter
models in multi-class radiography classification, focusing specifically on tube
placement assessment. A dataset comprising 8842 radiographs classified into
seven distinct categories was employed to extract embeddings using six
foundation models: DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, Med-Flamingo, MedImageInsight,
Rad-DINO, and CXR-Foundation. Adapter models were subsequently trained using
classical machine learning algorithms. Among these combinations,
MedImageInsight embeddings paired with an support vector machine adapter
yielded the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) at 93.8%, followed closely
by Rad-DINO (91.1%) and CXR-Foundation (89.0%). In comparison, BiomedCLIP and
DenseNet121 exhibited moderate performance with mAUC scores of 83.0% and 81.8%,
respectively, whereas Med-Flamingo delivered the lowest performance at 75.1%.
Notably, most adapter models demonstrated computational efficiency, achieving
training within one minute and inference within seconds on CPU, underscoring
their practicality for clinical applications. Furthermore, fairness analyses on
adapters trained on MedImageInsight-derived embeddings indicated minimal
disparities, with gender differences in performance within 2% and standard
deviations across age groups not exceeding 3%. These findings confirm that
foundation model embeddings-especially those from MedImageInsight-facilitate
accurate, computationally efficient, and equitable diagnostic classification
using lightweight adapters for radiographic image analysis.

Conclusion: CRT-YOLO框架及其模块在热红外目标检测领域具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Thermal Infrared (TIR) technology involves the use of sensors to detect and
measure infrared radiation emitted by objects, and it is widely utilized across
a broad spectrum of applications. The advancements in object detection methods
utilizing TIR images have sparked significant research interest. However, most
traditional methods lack the capability to effectively extract and fuse
local-global information, which is crucial for TIR-domain feature attention. In
this study, we present a novel and efficient thermal infrared object detection
framework, known as CRT-YOLO, that is based on centralized feature regulation,
enabling the establishment of global-range interaction on TIR information. Our
proposed model integrates efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) modules, which
adeptly capture long-range dependencies while incurring minimal computational
overhead. Additionally, it leverages the Centralized Feature Pyramid (CFP)
network, which offers global regulation of TIR features. Extensive experiments
conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CRT-YOLO model
significantly outperforms conventional methods for TIR image object detection.
Furthermore, the ablation study provides compelling evidence of the
effectiveness of our proposed modules, reinforcing the potential impact of our
approach on advancing the field of thermal infrared object detection.

Motivation: 解决单目RGB图像中未见物体6D姿态估计的挑战，尤其是缺乏先验物体知识的问题。

Method: 使用参考图像和几何对应关系，通过初始姿态预测和渲染-比较迭代细化姿态，并引入相关性体积引导的注意力机制。

Result: 在BOP基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时保持竞争力的运行时。

Conclusion: RefPose通过动态适应新物体形状，显著提升了未见物体的姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a
challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific
knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to
object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric
correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using
object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric
correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage,
RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the
generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a
render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a
correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures
correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods
that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new
object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence.
This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive
evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves
state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.

Abstract: People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) face significant challenges,
struggling to navigate environments and locate objects due to limited visual
cues. Spatial reasoning is crucial for these individuals, as it enables them to
understand and interpret the spatial relationships in their surroundings,
enhancing their ability to navigate and interact more safely and independently.
Current multi-modal large language (MLLM) models for low vision people lack the
spatial reasoning capabilities needed to effectively assist in these tasks.
Moreover, there is a notable absence of lightweight, easy-to-use systems that
allow pBLV to effectively perceive and interact with their surrounding
environment. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial enhanced multi-modal
large language model based approach for visually impaired individuals. By
fine-tuning the MLLM to incorporate spatial reasoning capabilities, our method
significantly improves the understanding of environmental context, which is
critical for navigation and object recognition. The innovation extends to a
hardware component, designed as an attachment for glasses, ensuring increased
accessibility and ease of use. This integration leverages advanced VLMs to
interpret visual data and provide real-time, spatially aware feedback to the
user. Our approach aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning
models and practical, user-friendly assistive devices, offering a robust
solution for visually impaired users to navigate their surroundings more
effectively and independently. The paper includes an in-depth evaluation using
the VizWiz dataset, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and user
experience. Additionally, we design a comprehensive dataset to evaluate our
method's effectiveness in realworld situations, demonstrating substantial

Abstract: Reliable three-dimensional human pose estimation is becoming increasingly
important for real-world applications, yet much of prior work has focused
solely on the performance within a single dataset. In practice, however,
systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups --
conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training,
which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges,
we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated
on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset
comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data.
Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to
systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most
widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to
support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified
interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily
modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures. We
re-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing
literature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error
(MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE)
metrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results.
Additionally, we analyze performance differences resulting from various
pre-processing techniques and dataset preparation parameters -- offering
further insight into model generalization capabilities.

from a 60-year-old female with three-vessel coronary stenosis, we segmented
cardiac chambers and coronary arteries, constructed dynamic models, and
implemented skeletal skinning weight computation to simulate vessel deformation
across 20 cardiac phases. Transparent vascular physical models were

and virtual angiography systems, implemented guidewire 3D reconstruction using
binocular stereo vision, and evaluated the system through angiography
validation and CABG training applications. Results: Morphological consistency
between virtual and real angiography reached 80.9%. Dice similarity
coefficients for guidewire motion ranged from 0.741-0.812, with mean trajectory
errors below 1.1 mm. The transparent model demonstrated advantages in CABG
training, allowing direct visualization while simulating beating heart

effectively reproduces both anatomical structures and dynamic characteristics
of coronary vasculature, offering a dynamic environment with visual and tactile
feedback valuable for education and clinical planning.

Conclusion: VISTA为MLLM模态对齐研究提供了新方向，无需额外模块或数据即可高效提升性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face a critical challenge in
modality alignment, often exhibiting a bias towards textual information at the
expense of other modalities like vision. This paper conducts a systematic
information-theoretic analysis of the widely used cross-entropy loss in MLLMs,
uncovering its implicit alignment objective. Our theoretical investigation
reveals that this implicit objective has inherent limitations, leading to a
degradation of cross-modal alignment as text sequence length increases, thereby
hindering effective multimodal information fusion. To overcome these drawbacks,
we propose Vision-Text Alignment (VISTA), a novel approach guided by our
theoretical insights. VISTA introduces an explicit alignment objective designed
to maximize cross-modal mutual information, preventing the degradation of
visual alignment. Notably, VISTA enhances the visual understanding capabilities
of existing MLLMs without requiring any additional trainable modules or extra
training data, making it both efficient and practical. Our method significantly
outperforms baseline models across more than a dozen benchmark datasets,
including VQAv2, MMStar, and MME, paving the way for new directions in MLLM
modal alignment research.

Result: 实验表明，LACLIP在CulTi数据集上显著优于现有模型，尤其在细粒度语义关联方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CulTi和LACLIP填补了中国文化遗产跨模态研究的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: China has a long and rich history, encompassing a vast cultural heritage that
includes diverse multimodal information, such as silk patterns, Dunhuang
murals, and their associated historical narratives. Cross-modal retrieval plays
a pivotal role in understanding and interpreting Chinese cultural heritage by
bridging visual and textual modalities to enable accurate text-to-image and
image-to-text retrieval. However, despite the growing interest in multimodal
research, there is a lack of specialized datasets dedicated to Chinese cultural
heritage, limiting the development and evaluation of cross-modal learning
models in this domain. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal dataset
named CulTi, which contains 5,726 image-text pairs extracted from two series of
professional documents, respectively related to ancient Chinese silk and
Dunhuang murals. Compared to existing general-domain multimodal datasets, CulTi
presents a challenge for cross-modal retrieval: the difficulty of local
alignment between intricate decorative motifs and specialized textual
descriptions. To address this challenge, we propose LACLIP, a training-free
local alignment strategy built upon a fine-tuned Chinese-CLIP. LACLIP enhances
the alignment of global textual descriptions with local visual regions by
computing weighted similarity scores during inference. Experimental results on
CulTi demonstrate that LACLIP significantly outperforms existing models in
cross-modal retrieval, particularly in handling fine-grained semantic
associations within Chinese cultural heritage.

Conclusion: M4-SAR数据集和E2E-OSDet框架为光学-SAR融合目标检测提供了标准化基准和强大基线。

Abstract: Single-source remote sensing object detection using optical or SAR images
struggles in complex environments. Optical images offer rich textural details
but are often affected by low-light, cloud-obscured, or low-resolution
conditions, reducing the detection performance. SAR images are robust to
weather, but suffer from speckle noise and limited semantic expressiveness.
Optical and SAR images provide complementary advantages, and fusing them can
significantly improve the detection accuracy. However, progress in this field
is hindered by the lack of large-scale, standardized datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose the first comprehensive dataset for optical-SAR fusion
object detection, named Multi-resolution, Multi-polarization, Multi-scene,
Multi-source SAR dataset (M4-SAR). It contains 112,184 precisely aligned image
pairs and nearly one million labeled instances with arbitrary orientations,
spanning six key categories. To enable standardized evaluation, we develop a
unified benchmarking toolkit that integrates six state-of-the-art multi-source
fusion methods. Furthermore, we propose E2E-OSDet, a novel end-to-end
multi-source fusion detection framework that mitigates cross-domain
discrepancies and establishes a robust baseline for future studies. Extensive
experiments on M4-SAR demonstrate that fusing optical and SAR data can improve
$mAP$ by 5.7\% over single-source inputs, with particularly significant gains
in complex environments. The dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了M2AD基准，用于评估视觉异常检测（VAD）在视角和光照交互作用下的鲁棒性，现有方法在此基准上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VAD系统对真实世界中的视角和光照变化敏感，现有基准未能充分评估这一挑战。

Method: 构建了包含119,880张高分辨率图像的M2AD基准，系统采集了10类999个样本的12种视角和10种光照配置（共120种）。

Result: 现有VAD方法在M2AD基准上表现显著不佳，揭示了视角-光照交互的严峻挑战。

Conclusion: M2AD是开发和验证VAD方法应对真实世界复杂性的重要工具，数据集和测试套件将公开。

Abstract: The practical deployment of Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems is
hindered by their sensitivity to real-world imaging variations, particularly
the complex interplay between viewpoint and illumination which drastically
alters defect visibility. Current benchmarks largely overlook this critical
challenge. We introduce Multi-View Multi-Illumination Anomaly Detection (M2AD),
a new large-scale benchmark comprising 119,880 high-resolution images designed
explicitly to probe VAD robustness under such interacting conditions. By
systematically capturing 999 specimens across 10 categories using 12
synchronized views and 10 illumination settings (120 configurations total),
M2AD enables rigorous evaluation. We establish two evaluation protocols:
M2AD-Synergy tests the ability to fuse information across diverse
configurations, and M2AD-Invariant measures single-image robustness against
realistic view-illumination effects. Our extensive benchmarking shows that
state-of-the-art VAD methods struggle significantly on M2AD, demonstrating the
profound challenge posed by view-illumination interplay. This benchmark serves
as an essential tool for developing and validating VAD methods capable of
overcoming real-world complexities. Our full dataset and test suite will be
released at https://hustcyq.github.io/M2AD to facilitate the field.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“自条件”的机制，通过利用去噪网络的内部语义信息来提升扩散模型的生成和识别能力，同时保持计算开销低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索扩散模型在生成预训练中获得的判别性表征是否能用于改进模型自身训练，并提升特征质量而不损害生成能力。

Method: 引入自条件机制，利用去噪网络的内部语义信息引导解码层，形成更紧凑的瓶颈以提升生成质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成FID和识别准确率上均有提升，计算开销仅增加1%，并在多种扩散架构中表现良好。

Conclusion: 自条件机制成功整合了判别性技术（如对比自蒸馏）到扩散模型中，同时保持生成质量，使其成为强大的表征学习器。

Abstract: While diffusion models have gained prominence in image synthesis, their
generative pre-training has been shown to yield discriminative representations,
paving the way towards unified visual generation and understanding. However,
two key questions remain: 1) Can these representations be leveraged to improve
the training of diffusion models themselves, rather than solely benefiting
downstream tasks? 2) Can the feature quality be enhanced to rival or even
surpass modern self-supervised learners, without compromising generative
capability? This work addresses these questions by introducing
self-conditioning, a straightforward yet effective mechanism that internally
leverages the rich semantics inherent in denoising network to guide its own
decoding layers, forming a tighter bottleneck that condenses high-level
semantics to improve generation. Results are compelling: our method boosts both
generation FID and recognition accuracy with 1% computational overhead and
generalizes across diverse diffusion architectures. Crucially,
self-conditioning facilitates an effective integration of discriminative
techniques, such as contrastive self-distillation, directly into diffusion
models without sacrificing generation quality. Extensive experiments on
pixel-space and latent-space datasets show that in linear evaluations, our
enhanced diffusion models, particularly UViT and DiT, serve as strong
representation learners, surpassing various self-supervised models.

TL;DR: ForensicHub是一个统一的多领域假图像检测与定位基准和代码库，旨在打破领域壁垒，提供模块化架构、基线模型和新基准，促进跨领域比较与研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前假图像检测与定位领域（FIDL）缺乏统一基准，导致各领域独立发展，无法跨领域比较，阻碍整体进展。

Method: 提出模块化配置驱动架构，分解法证流程为可互换组件；实现10个基线模型、6个骨干网络、2个新基准，并集成现有基准。

Result: 通过ForensicHub深入分析，提供了8个关键见解，涵盖模型架构、数据集特性和评估标准。

Conclusion: ForensicHub显著推动了FIDL领域的跨领域整合，为未来突破奠定了基础。

Abstract: The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly
fragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image
manipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial
intelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation
localization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a
unified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a
unified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain
independently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without
interoperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the
development of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we
propose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake
image detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset,
model, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the
scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks
in some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven
architecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components
across datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible
composition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6
backbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing
benchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii)
conducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable
insights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation
standards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the
domain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如DocVQA和ChartQA）主要基于扫描或数字文档，未能反映真实场景中的复杂挑战（如光照变化和物理变形）。

Method: WildDoc通过手动捕获多样化的真实文档图像，并在不同条件下多次拍摄每份文档，以评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 评估显示，当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在WildDoc上性能显著下降，鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: WildDoc突出了真实世界文档理解的独特挑战，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced capabilities in Document Understanding. However,
prevailing benchmarks like DocVQA and ChartQA predominantly comprise
\textit{scanned or digital} documents, inadequately reflecting the intricate
challenges posed by diverse real-world scenarios, such as variable illumination
and physical distortions. This paper introduces WildDoc, the inaugural
benchmark designed specifically for assessing document understanding in natural
environments. WildDoc incorporates a diverse set of manually captured document
images reflecting real-world conditions and leverages document sources from
established benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive comparisons with digital or
scanned documents. Further, to rigorously evaluate model robustness, each
document is captured four times under different conditions. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildDoc expose substantial performance declines and
underscore the models' inadequate robustness compared to traditional
benchmarks, highlighting the unique challenges posed by real-world document
understanding. Our project homepage is available at

Motivation: 减少医学图像分割中的手动标注成本，同时提升半监督学习的效果。

Method: 提出双师生学习框架（DTSL），结合跨架构模型和时序滞后模型的一致性，利用Jensen-Shannon散度生成伪标签。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，消融实验验证了模块的有效性。

Conclusion: DTSL框架通过跨架构和时序一致性提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has attracted significant
attention due to its potential to reduce manual annotation costs. The mean
teacher (MT) strategy, commonly understood as introducing smoothed, temporally
lagged consistency regularization, has demonstrated strong performance across
various tasks in this field. In this work, we reinterpret the MT strategy on
supervised data as a form of self-paced learning, regulated by the output
agreement between the temporally lagged teacher model and the ground truth
labels. This idea is further extended to incorporate agreement between a
temporally lagged model and a cross-architectural model, which offers greater
flexibility in regulating the learning pace and enables application to
unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose dual teacher-student learning (DTSL),
a framework that introduces two groups of teacher-student models with different
architectures. The output agreement between the cross-group teacher and student
models is used as pseudo-labels, generated via a Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based consensus label generator (CLG). Extensive experiments on
popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules.

Method: 收集496,377个众包标注，识别离题样本、近似重复和标签错误，结合项目反应理论模型和专家审核生成基准。

Conclusion: CleanPatrick为图像清理策略提供系统比较框架，促进更可靠的数据驱动AI。

Abstract: Robust machine learning depends on clean data, yet current image data
cleaning benchmarks rely on synthetic noise or narrow human studies, limiting
comparison and real-world relevance. We introduce CleanPatrick, the first
large-scale benchmark for data cleaning in the image domain, built upon the
publicly available Fitzpatrick17k dermatology dataset. We collect 496,377
binary annotations from 933 medical crowd workers, identify off-topic samples
(4%), near-duplicates (21%), and label errors (22%), and employ an aggregation
model inspired by item-response theory followed by expert review to derive
high-quality ground truth. CleanPatrick formalizes issue detection as a ranking
task and adopts typical ranking metrics mirroring real audit workflows.
Benchmarking classical anomaly detectors, perceptual hashing, SSIM, Confident
Learning, NoiseRank, and SelfClean, we find that, on CleanPatrick,
self-supervised representations excel at near-duplicate detection, classical
methods achieve competitive off-topic detection under constrained review
budgets, and label-error detection remains an open challenge for fine-grained
medical classification. By releasing both the dataset and the evaluation
framework, CleanPatrick enables a systematic comparison of image-cleaning
strategies and paves the way for more reliable data-centric artificial
intelligence.

Motivation: 街景数据在计算机视觉应用中广泛使用，但现有数据集假设为系统性代表城市，而实际上存在覆盖不均的问题。研究旨在揭示城市特性如何导致数据偏差。

Method: 定量分析全球28个城市的街景数据分布偏差，并提出评估方法；通过阿姆斯特丹的案例研究和半结构化访谈，探讨数据收集过程对城市代表性的影响。

Result: 发现城市布局等特性会导致街景数据偏差，即使密集覆盖；案例研究揭示了数据收集过程中的具体偏差来源。

Conclusion: 城市特性会导致街景数据偏差，需通过评估方法和改进收集过程来减少偏差，提升数据代表性。

Abstract: Street view data is increasingly being used in computer vision applications
in recent years. Machine learning datasets are collected for these applications
using simple sampling techniques. These datasets are assumed to be a systematic
representation of cities, especially when densely sampled. Prior works however,
show that there are clear gaps in coverage, with certain cities or regions
being covered poorly or not at all. Here we demonstrate that a cities'
idiosyncracies, such as city layout, may lead to biases in street view data for
28 cities across the globe, even when they are densely covered. We
quantitatively uncover biases in the distribution of coverage of street view
data and propose a method for evaluation of such distributions to get better
insight in idiosyncracies in a cities' coverage. In addition, we perform a case
study of Amsterdam with semi-structured interviews, showing how idiosyncracies
of the collection process impact representation of cities and regions and
allowing us to address biases at their source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉模型常依赖数据集中的虚假相关性学习偏差，而现有方法需要人工标注或预定义偏差，效率低且不全面。

Method: CUBIC利用图像-文本潜在空间和线性分类器探测，通过分析超类标签潜在表示的变化来识别影响模型预测的概念。

Result: 实验表明，CUBIC能有效发现未知偏差，无需预定义偏差或模型失败样本。

Conclusion: CUBIC为自动识别模型偏差提供了一种高效且无需人工干预的新方法。

Abstract: Deep vision models often rely on biases learned from spurious correlations in
datasets. To identify these biases, methods that interpret high-level,
human-understandable concepts are more effective than those relying primarily
on low-level features like heatmaps. A major challenge for these concept-based
methods is the lack of image annotations indicating potentially bias-inducing
concepts, since creating such annotations requires detailed labeling for each
dataset and concept, which is highly labor-intensive. We present CUBIC (Concept
embeddings for Unsupervised Bias IdentifiCation), a novel method that
automatically discovers interpretable concepts that may bias classifier
behavior. Unlike existing approaches, CUBIC does not rely on predefined bias
candidates or examples of model failures tied to specific biases, as such
information is not always available. Instead, it leverages image-text latent
space and linear classifier probes to examine how the latent representation of
a superclass label$\unicode{x2014}$shared by all instances in the
dataset$\unicode{x2014}$is influenced by the presence of a given concept. By
measuring these shifts against the normal vector to the classifier's decision
boundary, CUBIC identifies concepts that significantly influence model
predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that CUBIC effectively uncovers
previously unknown biases using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without requiring
the samples in the dataset where the classifier underperforms or prior
knowledge of potential biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Visual Mamba在单高光谱图像超分辨率任务中因1D扫描导致的伪影问题。

Method: 引入条带扫描方案和小波分解，平衡高频空间特征与低频光谱特征的模态冲突。

Result: HSRMamba在计算负载和模型大小上表现优异，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: HSRMamba在超分辨率任务中实现了最佳效果，同时保持了高效计算。

Abstract: Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) aims to restore
high-resolution images from low-resolution hyperspectral images. Recently, the
Visual Mamba model has achieved an impressive balance between performance and
computational efficiency. However, due to its 1D scanning paradigm, the model
may suffer from potential artifacts during image generation. To address this
issue, we propose HSRMamba. While maintaining the computational efficiency of
Visual Mamba, we introduce a strip-based scanning scheme to effectively reduce
artifacts from global unidirectional scanning. Additionally, HSRMamba uses
wavelet decomposition to alleviate modal conflicts between high-frequency
spatial features and low-frequency spectral features, further improving
super-resolution performance. Extensive experiments show that HSRMamba not only
excels in reducing computational load and model size but also outperforms
existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型的方法Group Preference Optimization（GPO），通过从成对偏好扩展到组偏好并结合奖励标准化，解决了Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）在T2I任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO在T2I任务中存在两个问题：对偏好对的敏感性和高质量数据收集的耗时性。偏好对的微小差异可能降低DPO性能，而DPO仅依赖相对排名而忽略绝对差异，可能导致错误分类。

Method: 提出GPO方法，将DPO从成对扩展到组偏好，并引入奖励标准化进行重新加权，无需显式数据选择。GPO利用模型自身能力进行自我改进，无需外部数据。

Result: 实验表明，GPO在各种扩散模型和任务中均有效。结合YOLO和OCR等计算机视觉模型，GPO将Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium的计数和文本渲染能力提升了20个百分点。

Conclusion: GPO作为一种即插即用方法，无需推理时的额外开销，显著提升了T2I扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has shown notable improvements in generation quality.
However, applying DPO to T2I faces two challenges: the sensitivity of DPO to
preference pairs and the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating
high-quality data. In this work, we demonstrate that preference pairs with
marginal differences can degrade DPO performance. Since DPO relies exclusively
on relative ranking while disregarding the absolute difference of pairs, it may
misclassify losing samples as wins, or vice versa. We empirically show that
extending the DPO from pairwise to groupwise and incorporating reward
standardization for reweighting leads to performance gains without explicit
data selection. Furthermore, we propose Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an
effective self-improvement method that enhances performance by leveraging the
model's own capabilities without requiring external data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GPO is effective across various diffusion models and tasks.
Specifically, combining with widely used computer vision models, such as YOLO
and OCR, the GPO improves the accurate counting and text rendering capabilities
of the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium by 20 percentage points. Notably, as a
plug-and-play method, no extra overhead is introduced during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督实例分割（SSIS）面临伪标签噪声导致的性能不稳定问题，现有方法通过单一阈值评估类别和掩码质量，导致两者质量难以平衡。

Method: PL-DC框架包括三个部分：1) 实例级解耦双阈值过滤机制；2) 类别级动态实例类别校正模块；3) 像素级掩码不确定性感知机制。

Result: 在COCO和Cityscapes数据集上，PL-DC显著提升了性能，尤其在少量标注数据下表现突出（如1% COCO数据提升11.6 mAP）。

Conclusion: PL-DC通过解耦和校正伪标签质量，有效解决了SSIS中的噪声问题，实现了新的性能突破。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation (SSIS) involves classifying and
grouping image pixels into distinct object instances using limited labeled
data. This learning paradigm usually faces a significant challenge of unstable
performance caused by noisy pseudo-labels of instance categories and pixel
masks. We find that the prevalent practice of filtering instance pseudo-labels
assessing both class and mask quality with a single score threshold, frequently
leads to compromises in the trade-off between the qualities of class and mask
labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel Pseudo-Label Quality Decoupling and
Correction (PL-DC) framework for SSIS to tackle the above challenges. Firstly,
at the instance level, a decoupled dual-threshold filtering mechanism is
designed to decouple class and mask quality estimations for instance-level
pseudo-labels, thereby independently controlling pixel classifying and grouping
qualities. Secondly, at the category level, we introduce a dynamic instance
category correction module to dynamically correct the pseudo-labels of instance
categories, effectively alleviating category confusion. Lastly, we introduce a
pixel-level mask uncertainty-aware mechanism at the pixel level to re-weight
the mask loss for different pixels, thereby reducing the impact of noise
introduced by pixel-level mask pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the COCO
and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that the proposed PL-DC achieves
significant performance improvements, setting new state-of-the-art results for
SSIS. Notably, our PL-DC shows substantial gains even with minimal labeled
data, achieving an improvement of +11.6 mAP with just 1% COCO labeled data and
+15.5 mAP with 5% Cityscapes labeled data. The code will be public.

Conclusion: Hybrid-Emba3D通过几何特征耦合和跨路径混合，有效解决了点云分类中的局部特征提取问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: The point cloud classification tasks face the dual challenge of efficiently
extracting local geometric features while maintaining model complexity. The
Mamba architecture utilizes the linear complexity advantage of state space
models (SSMs) to overcome the computational bottleneck of Transformers while
balancing global modeling capabilities. However, the inherent contradiction
between its unidirectional dependency and the unordered nature of point clouds
impedes modeling spatial correlation in local neighborhoods, thus constraining
geometric feature extraction. This paper proposes Hybrid-Emba3D, a
bidirectional Mamba model enhanced by geometry-feature coupling and cross-path
feature hybridization. The Local geometric pooling with geometry-feature
coupling mechanism significantly enhances local feature discriminative power
via coordinated propagation and dynamic aggregation of geometric information
between local center points and their neighborhoods, without introducing
additional parameters. The designed Collaborative feature enhancer adopts
dual-path hybridization, effectively handling local mutations and sparse key
signals, breaking through the limitations of traditional SSM long-range
modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
new SOTA classification accuracy of 95.99% on ModelNet40 with only 0.03M
additional.

Abstract: Synthetic media generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) pose
significant challenges in verifying authenticity and tracing dataset origins,
raising critical concerns in copyright enforcement, privacy protection, and
legal compliance. This paper introduces a novel forensic framework for
identifying the training dataset (e.g., CelebA or FFHQ) of GAN-generated images
through interpretable feature analysis. By integrating spectral transforms
(Fourier/DCT), color distribution metrics, and local feature descriptors
(SIFT), our pipeline extracts discriminative statistical signatures embedded in
synthetic outputs. Supervised classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) achieve
98-99% accuracy in binary classification (real vs. synthetic) and multi-class
dataset attribution across diverse GAN architectures (StyleGAN, AttGAN, GDWCT,
StarGAN, and StyleGAN2). Experimental results highlight the dominance of
frequency-domain features (DCT/FFT) in capturing dataset-specific artifacts,
such as upsampling patterns and spectral irregularities, while color histograms
reveal implicit regularization strategies in GAN training. We further examine
legal and ethical implications, showing how dataset attribution can address
copyright infringement, unauthorized use of personal data, and regulatory
compliance under frameworks like GDPR and California's AB 602. Our framework
advances accountability and governance in generative modeling, with
applications in digital forensics, content moderation, and intellectual
property litigation.

Abstract: The development of foundation models through pretraining of vision-language
models (VLMs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS).
VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number
of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple
captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically
similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To
overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for
VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary
information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies
through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive
importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two
techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In
the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual
evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique
sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique,
importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of
relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA
strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance
on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed
strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on
the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate
techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法尚未充分利用生物视觉处理系统的见解，PhiNet v2旨在构建更接近人类视觉处理的计算机视觉系统。

Result: PhiNet v2在性能上接近最先进的视觉基础模型，并能从序列输入中学习。

Conclusion: PhiNet v2是迈向更生物合理的计算机视觉系统的重要一步，其处理方式更接近人类认知过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have revolutionized
computer vision through innovative architectures and learning objectives, yet
they have not fully leveraged insights from biological visual processing
systems. Recently, a brain-inspired SSL model named PhiNet was proposed; it is
based on a ResNet backbone and operates on static image inputs with strong
augmentation. In this paper, we introduce PhiNet v2, a novel Transformer-based
architecture that processes temporal visual input (that is, sequences of
images) without relying on strong augmentation. Our model leverages variational
inference to learn robust visual representations from continuous input streams,
similar to human visual processing. Through extensive experimentation, we
demonstrate that PhiNet v2 achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art vision foundation models, while maintaining the ability to
learn from sequential input without strong data augmentation. This work
represents a significant step toward more biologically plausible computer
vision systems that process visual information in a manner more closely aligned
with human cognitive processes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种文本-图像协同概念擦除（Co-Erasing）框架，通过结合视觉监督和文本提示，显著提高了概念擦除的效果和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的概念擦除方法依赖手动设计的文本提示，难以在高效擦除有害内容的同时最小化对其他良性概念的影响。

Method: Co-Erasing通过文本提示和对应不良图像的联合描述，利用负向指导降低目标概念的生成概率，并结合文本引导的图像概念细化策略。

Result: 实验表明，Co-Erasing在擦除效果和可用性之间取得了更好的平衡，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Co-Erasing通过视觉监督和文本引导的结合，有效解决了文本与图像模态间的知识鸿沟问题。

Abstract: Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent
text-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even
harmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually
crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure
(efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In
this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text
and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled
concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address
this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision
into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative
Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the
concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images
induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the
target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses
the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure
efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement
strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to
the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts.
Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms
state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off
between efficacy and usability. Codes are available at

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理任务中是否具备与人类相当的能力。

Method: 构建包含9,794个多模态问题的基准（Human-Aligned Bench），涵盖四种问题类型，并记录人类成功率和易错选项。

Result: 实验显示当前MLLMs在多模态推理任务中的表现与人类存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该基准为下一代模型的开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is to imitate
humans and surpass them. Models such as OpenAI's o1, o3, and DeepSeek's R1 have
demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning
capabilities exhibit exceptional performance and are being gradually integrated
into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, whether these models
possess capabilities comparable to humans in handling reasoning tasks remains
unclear at present. In this paper, we propose Human-Aligned Bench, a benchmark
for fine-grained alignment of multimodal reasoning with human performance.
Specifically, we collected 9,794 multimodal questions that solely rely on
contextual reasoning, including bilingual (Chinese and English) multimodal
questions and pure text-based questions, encompassing four question types:
visual reasoning, definition judgment, analogical reasoning, and logical
judgment. More importantly, each question is accompanied by human success rates
and options that humans are prone to choosing incorrectly. Extensive
experiments on the Human-Aligned Bench reveal notable differences between the
performance of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and human performance. The
findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the
next-generation models.

Conclusion: HACO框架为密集手部接触估计提供了有效的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Hands are essential to human interaction, and understanding contact between
hands and the world can promote comprehensive understanding of their function.
Recently, there have been growing number of hand interaction datasets that
cover interaction with object, other hand, scene, and body. Despite the
significance of the task and increasing high-quality data, how to effectively
learn dense hand contact estimation remains largely underexplored. There are
two major challenges for learning dense hand contact estimation. First, there
exists class imbalance issue from hand contact datasets where majority of
samples are not in contact. Second, hand contact datasets contain spatial
imbalance issue with most of hand contact exhibited in finger tips, resulting
in challenges for generalization towards contacts in other hand regions. To
tackle these issues, we present a framework that learns dense HAnd COntact
estimation (HACO) from imbalanced data. To resolve the class imbalance issue,
we introduce balanced contact sampling, which builds and samples from multiple
sampling groups that fairly represent diverse contact statistics for both
contact and non-contact samples. Moreover, to address the spatial imbalance
issue, we propose vertex-level class-balanced (VCB) loss, which incorporates
spatially varying contact distribution by separately reweighting loss
contribution of each vertex based on its contact frequency across dataset. As a
result, we effectively learn to predict dense hand contact estimation with
large-scale hand contact data without suffering from class and spatial
imbalance issue. The codes will be released.

Abstract: The automatic diagnosis of chest diseases is a popular and challenging task.
Most current methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which
focus on local features while neglecting global features. Recently,
self-attention mechanisms have been introduced into the field of computer
vision, demonstrating superior performance. Therefore, this paper proposes an
effective model, CheX-DS, for classifying long-tail multi-label data in the

DenseNet for medical imaging and the newly popular Swin Transformer model,
utilizing ensemble deep learning techniques to combine the two models and
leverage the advantages of both CNNs and Transformers. The loss function of
CheX-DS combines weighted binary cross-entropy loss with asymmetric loss,
effectively addressing the issue of data imbalance. The NIH ChestX-ray14

outperforms previous studies with an excellent average AUC score of 83.76\%,

TL;DR: 论文提出了CompAlign基准和CompQuest评估框架，用于评估和改进T2I模型在组合图像生成中的表现，尤其是3D空间关系。实验表明模型在复杂任务中表现不佳，但通过改进方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型在生成组合场景（多对象、属性和空间关系）时表现不佳，需要更精确的评估和改进方法。

Method: 提出CompAlign基准（900个复杂提示）和CompQuest框架（分解提示为子问题，用MLLM提供细粒度反馈），并设计对齐框架利用反馈改进模型。

Result: 实验显示模型在复杂3D空间任务中表现较差，开源与商业模型差距明显；改进后模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CompAlign和CompQuest为组合图像生成提供了有效评估和改进工具，改进方法显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art T2I models are capable of generating high-resolution images
given textual prompts. However, they still struggle with accurately depicting
compositional scenes that specify multiple objects, attributes, and spatial
relations. We present CompAlign, a challenging benchmark with an emphasis on
assessing the depiction of 3D-spatial relationships, for evaluating and
improving models on compositional image generation. CompAlign consists of 900
complex multi-subject image generation prompts that combine numerical and
3D-spatial relationships with varied attribute bindings. Our benchmark is
remarkably challenging, incorporating generation tasks with 3+ generation
subjects with complex 3D-spatial relationships. Additionally, we propose
CompQuest, an interpretable and accurate evaluation framework that decomposes
complex prompts into atomic sub-questions, then utilizes a MLLM to provide
fine-grained binary feedback on the correctness of each aspect of generation
elements in model-generated images. This enables precise quantification of
alignment between generated images and compositional prompts. Furthermore, we
propose an alignment framework that uses CompQuest's feedback as preference
signals to improve diffusion models' compositional image generation abilities.
Using adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and
flexible for different tasks. Evaluation of 9 T2I models reveals that: (1)
models remarkable struggle more with compositional tasks with more complex
3D-spatial configurations, and (2) a noticeable performance gap exists between
open-source accessible models and closed-source commercial models. Further
empirical study on using CompAlign for model alignment yield promising results:
post-alignment diffusion models achieve remarkable improvements in
compositional accuracy, especially on complex generation tasks, outperforming
previous approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法在实例级和集群级一致性学习上存在局限性，无法构建跨视图的共享语义空间，且过度依赖一致性导致不可靠的插补和对齐。

Method: FreeCSL通过学习共识原型构建共享空间，并设计基于模块化的启发式图聚类以增强集群语义。

Result: 实验表明，FreeCSL在不完整多视图聚类任务中比现有方法表现更优。

Conclusion: FreeCSL通过共识语义学习和集群结构恢复，显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: In incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC), missing data induce prototype
shifts within views and semantic inconsistencies across views. A feasible
solution is to explore cross-view consistency in paired complete observations,
further imputing and aligning the similarity relationships inherently shared
across views. Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by two-tiered
limitations: (1) Neither instance- nor cluster-level consistency learning
construct a semantic space shared across views to learn consensus semantics.
The former enforces cross-view instances alignment, and wrongly regards
unpaired observations with semantic consistency as negative pairs; the latter
focuses on cross-view cluster counterparts while coarsely handling fine-grained
intra-cluster relationships within views. (2) Excessive reliance on consistency
results in unreliable imputation and alignment without incorporating
view-specific cluster information. Thus, we propose an IMVC framework,
imputation- and alignment-free for consensus semantics learning (FreeCSL). To
bridge semantic gaps across all observations, we learn consensus prototypes
from available data to discover a shared space, where semantically similar
observations are pulled closer for consensus semantics learning. To capture
semantic relationships within specific views, we design a heuristic graph
clustering based on modularity to recover cluster structure with intra-cluster
compactness and inter-cluster separation for cluster semantics enhancement.
Extensive experiments demonstrate, compared to state-of-the-art competitors,
FreeCSL achieves more confident and robust assignments on IMVC task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假负样本在VLP中引入冲突的监督信号，影响嵌入空间学习和硬负采样的效果。

Method: FALCON通过动态选择负样本的硬度，结合跨模态对齐改进的代理指导，自适应构建小批量。

Result: 实验表明，FALCON在ALBEF和BLIP-2框架及多种下游任务中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: FALCON有效缓解假负样本的影响，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: False negatives pose a critical challenge in vision-language pretraining
(VLP) due to the many-to-many correspondence between images and texts in
large-scale datasets. These false negatives introduce conflicting supervision
signals that degrade the learned embedding space and diminish the effectiveness
of hard negative sampling. In this paper, we propose FALCON (False-negative
Aware Learning of COntrastive Negatives), a learning-based mini-batch
construction strategy that adaptively balances the trade-off between hard and
false negatives during VLP. Rather than relying on fixed heuristics, FALCON
employs a negative mining scheduler that dynamically selects negative samples
of appropriate hardness for each anchor instance during mini-batch
construction, guided by a proxy for cross-modal alignment improvement.
Experimental results demonstrate that FALCON significantly improves performance
across two widely adopted VLP frameworks (ALBEF, BLIP-2) and a broad range of
downstream tasks and evaluation settings, underscoring its effectiveness and
robustness in mitigating the impact of false negatives.

Result: DiCo在ImageNet上实现了更高的图像质量和生成速度，DiCo-H达到FID 1.90。

Conclusion: DiCo证明了卷积在扩散模型中的高效性和表现力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a promising diffusion model for visual
generation, demonstrates impressive performance but incurs significant
computational overhead. Intriguingly, analysis of pre-trained DiT models
reveals that global self-attention is often redundant, predominantly capturing
local patterns-highlighting the potential for more efficient alternatives. In
this paper, we revisit convolution as an alternative building block for
constructing efficient and expressive diffusion models. However, naively
replacing self-attention with convolution typically results in degraded
performance. Our investigations attribute this performance gap to the higher
channel redundancy in ConvNets compared to Transformers. To resolve this, we
introduce a compact channel attention mechanism that promotes the activation of
more diverse channels, thereby enhancing feature diversity. This leads to
Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a family of diffusion models built entirely from
standard ConvNet modules, offering strong generative performance with
significant efficiency gains. On class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, DiCo
outperforms previous diffusion models in both image quality and generation
speed. Notably, DiCo-XL achieves an FID of 2.05 at 256x256 resolution and 2.53
at 512x512, with a 2.7x and 3.1x speedup over DiT-XL/2, respectively.
Furthermore, our largest model, DiCo-H, scaled to 1B parameters, reaches an FID
of 1.90 on ImageNet 256x256-without any additional supervision during training.

Conclusion: 测地距离作为一种新距离度量，在多模态学习中表现出优越性，解决了传统度量的局限性。

Abstract: Geodesic distance serves as a reliable means of measuring distance in
nonlinear spaces, and such nonlinear manifolds are prevalent in the current
multimodal learning. In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high
similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance
metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples.
This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in
multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples,
aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach
incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance
for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph
structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by
thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm
to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient
computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through
clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status
updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture
complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal
learning models.

Abstract: Event cameras, which capture brightness changes with high temporal
resolution, inherently generate a significant amount of redundant and noisy
data beyond essential object structures. The primary challenge in event-based
object recognition lies in effectively removing this noise without losing
critical spatial-temporal information. To address this, we propose an Adaptive
Graph-based Noisy Data Removal framework for Event-based Object Recognition.
Specifically, our approach integrates adaptive event segmentation based on
normalized density analysis, a multifactorial edge-weighting mechanism, and
adaptive graph-based denoising strategies. These innovations significantly
enhance the integration of spatiotemporal information, effectively filtering
noise while preserving critical structural features for robust recognition.
Experimental evaluations on four challenging datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves superior recognition accuracies of 83.77%, 76.79%, 99.30%, and
96.89%, surpassing existing graph-based methods by up to 8.79%, and improving
noise reduction performance by up to 19.57%, with an additional accuracy gain
of 6.26% compared to traditional Euclidean-based techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models have made substantial advances in image generation, yet
models trained on large, unfiltered datasets often yield outputs misaligned
with human preferences. Numerous methods have been proposed to fine-tune
pre-trained diffusion models, achieving notable improvements in aligning
generated outputs with human preferences. However, we argue that existing
preference alignment methods neglect the critical role of handling
unconditional/negative-conditional outputs, leading to a diminished capacity to
avoid generating undesirable outcomes. This oversight limits the efficacy of
classifier-free guidance~(CFG), which relies on the contrast between
conditional generation and unconditional/negative-conditional generation to
optimize output quality. In response, we propose a straightforward but
versatile effective approach that involves training a model specifically
attuned to negative preferences. This method does not require new training
strategies or datasets but rather involves minor modifications to existing
techniques. Our approach integrates seamlessly with models such as SD1.5, SDXL,
video diffusion models and models that have undergone preference optimization,
consistently enhancing their alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Image enhancement methods often prioritize pixel level information,
overlooking the semantic features. We propose a novel, unsupervised,
fuzzy-inspired image enhancement framework guided by NSGA-II algorithm that
optimizes image brightness, contrast, and gamma parameters to achieve a balance
between visual quality and semantic fidelity. Central to our proposed method is
the use of a pre trained deep neural network as a feature extractor. To find
the best enhancement settings, we use a GPU-accelerated NSGA-II algorithm that
balances multiple objectives, namely, increasing image entropy, improving
perceptual similarity, and maintaining appropriate brightness. We further
improve the results by applying a local search phase to fine-tune the top
candidates from the genetic algorithm. Our approach operates entirely without
paired training data making it broadly applicable across domains with limited
or noisy labels. Quantitatively, our model achieves excellent performance with
average BRISQUE and NIQE scores of 19.82 and 3.652, respectively, in all
unpaired datasets. Qualitatively, enhanced images by our model exhibit
significantly improved visibility in shadowed regions, natural balance of
contrast and also preserve the richer fine detail without introducing noticable
artifacts. This work opens new directions for unsupervised image enhancement
where semantic consistency is critical.

Abstract: The remarkable ease of use of diffusion models for image generation has led
to a proliferation of synthetic content online. While these models are often
employed for legitimate purposes, they are also used to generate fake images
that support misinformation and hate speech. Consequently, it is crucial to
develop robust tools capable of detecting whether an image has been generated
by such models. Many current detection methods, however, require large volumes
of sample images for training. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the
field, existing datasets often cover only a limited range of models and quickly
become outdated. In this work, we introduce DRAGON, a comprehensive dataset
comprising images from 25 diffusion models, spanning both recent advancements
and older, well-established architectures. The dataset contains a broad variety
of images representing diverse subjects. To enhance image realism, we propose a
simple yet effective pipeline that leverages a large language model to expand
input prompts, thereby generating more diverse and higher-quality outputs, as
evidenced by improvements in standard quality metrics. The dataset is provided
in multiple sizes (ranging from extra-small to extra-large) to accomodate
different research scenarios. DRAGON is designed to support the forensic
community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for
synthetic content. Additionally, the dataset is accompanied by a dedicated test
set, intended to serve as a benchmark for assessing the performance of newly
developed methods.

*Mohamed Ali Chebbi,Ewelina Rupnik,Paul Lopes,Marc Pierrot-Deseilligny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-DeepSimNets是一种用于多视图相似性学习的深度神经网络套件，利用极线几何进行训练，无需繁琐的多视图数据集创建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集匹配方法在多视图重建中表现有限，需要改进相似性学习以提升重建效果。

Method: 通过在线几何先验描述像素关系，生成几何感知特征，并通过平面扫描投影候选深度假设，构建并正则化成本体积。

Result: MV-DeepSimNets在性能和泛化能力上优于现有相似性学习网络和端到端回归模型。

Conclusion: 该方法可直接集成到标准多分辨率图像匹配流程中，适用于航空和卫星影像。

Abstract: We introduce MV-DeepSimNets, a comprehensive suite of deep neural networks
designed for multi-view similarity learning, leveraging epipolar geometry for
training. Our approach incorporates an online geometry prior to characterize
pixel relationships, either along the epipolar line or through homography
rectification. This enables the generation of geometry-aware features from
native images, which are then projected across candidate depth hypotheses using
plane sweeping. Our method geometric preconditioning effectively adapts
epipolar-based features for enhanced multi-view reconstruction, without
requiring the laborious multi-view training dataset creation. By aggregating
learned similarities, we construct and regularize the cost volume, leading to
improved multi-view surface reconstruction over traditional dense matching
approaches. MV-DeepSimNets demonstrates superior performance against leading
similarity learning networks and end-to-end regression models, especially in
terms of generalization capabilities across both aerial and satellite imagery
with varied ground sampling distances. Our pipeline is integrated into MicMac
software and can be readily adopted in standard multi-resolution image matching
pipelines.

*Wuzhou Quan,Mingqiang Wei,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairHyp是一个公平性导向的框架，通过专门模块解决高光谱图像（HSI）中的非均匀性问题，包括空间一致性恢复、特征增强和光谱依赖建模，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HSI模型假设维度同质性，导致性能不佳和偏差表示，FairHyp旨在解决这种非均匀性问题。

Method: FairHyp包含三个模块：Runge-Kutta启发的空间适配器、多感受野卷积模块和双向Mamba扫描的光谱状态空间模型。

Result: 在分类、去噪、超分辨率和修复等任务中，FairHyp表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FairHyp重新定义了HSI建模中的公平性，为高维视觉任务提供了平衡适应性、效率和保真度的新范式。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) representation is fundamentally challenged by
pervasive non-uniformity, where spectral dependencies, spatial continuity, and
feature efficiency exhibit complex and often conflicting behaviors. Most
existing models rely on a unified processing paradigm that assumes homogeneity
across dimensions, leading to suboptimal performance and biased
representations. To address this, we propose FairHyp, a fairness-directed
framework that explicitly disentangles and resolves the threefold
non-uniformity through cooperative yet specialized modules. We introduce a
Runge-Kutta-inspired spatial variability adapter to restore spatial coherence
under resolution discrepancies, a multi-receptive field convolution module with
sparse-aware refinement to enhance discriminative features while respecting
inherent sparsity, and a spectral-context state space model that captures
stable and long-range spectral dependencies via bidirectional Mamba scanning
and statistical aggregation. Unlike one-size-fits-all solutions, FairHyp
achieves dimension-specific adaptation while preserving global consistency and
mutual reinforcement. This design is grounded in the view that non-uniformity
arises from the intrinsic structure of HSI representations, rather than any
particular task setting. To validate this, we apply FairHyp across four
representative tasks including classification, denoising, super-resolution, and
inpaintin, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling a shared structural
flaw. Extensive experiments show that FairHyp consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods under varied imaging conditions. Our findings redefine
fairness as a structural necessity in HSI modeling and offer a new paradigm for
balancing adaptability, efficiency, and fidelity in high-dimensional vision
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTevent数据集为高速机器人感知提供支持，结合事件相机和RGB相机，适用于6D姿态估计和动态物体检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速移动机器人因RGB相机运动模糊和延迟问题难以有效利用其速度，事件相机因其异步和低延迟特性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 创建MTevent数据集，包含75个场景，每个场景平均16秒，使用立体事件相机和RGB相机捕捉16个独特物体在极端条件下的数据。

Result: 在RGB图像上使用FoundationPose进行6D姿态估计，平均召回率为0.22，显示RGB方法在动态环境中的局限性。

Conclusion: MTevent数据集填补了高速运动、长距离感知和真实物体交互的研究空白，为事件视觉在机器人中的应用提供了新资源。

Abstract: Mobile robots are reaching unprecedented speeds, with platforms like Unitree
B2, and Fraunhofer O3dyn achieving maximum speeds between 5 and 10 m/s.
However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the
limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide
real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and
low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic
perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose
estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with
large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an
RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16
unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles,
varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine
high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions,
making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To
establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's
FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with
ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in
such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve
perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为B3的新型批量构建策略，通过预训练教师模型和社区检测算法优化对比学习中的负样本质量，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习的效果受批量大小和质量的显著影响，现有方法需要大批量才能取得好效果，限制了其应用。

Method: 使用预训练教师模型对数据集中的样本进行排序，构建稀疏相似图，并通过社区检测算法识别强负样本簇，从而构建高质量的批量。

Result: 在MMEB多模态嵌入基准测试中，B3方法在7B和2B模型规模上分别比现有最佳方法提高了1.3和2.9分，且仅需64的小批量即可超越现有结果。

Conclusion: B3方法通过优化批量构建，显著提升了对比学习的效率，减少了对大批量的依赖，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a prevalent technique for training embedding
models, which pulls semantically similar examples (positives) closer in the
representation space while pushing dissimilar ones (negatives) further apart. A
key source of negatives are 'in-batch' examples, i.e., positives from other
examples in the batch. Effectiveness of such models is hence strongly
influenced by the size and quality of training batches. In this work, we
propose 'Breaking the Batch Barrier' (B3), a novel batch construction strategy
designed to curate high-quality batches for CL. Our approach begins by using a
pretrained teacher embedding model to rank all examples in the dataset, from
which a sparse similarity graph is constructed. A community detection algorithm
is then applied to this graph to identify clusters of examples that serve as
strong negatives for one another. The clusters are then used to construct
batches that are rich in in-batch negatives. Empirical results on the MMEB
multimodal embedding benchmark (36 tasks) demonstrate that our method sets a
new state of the art, outperforming previous best methods by +1.3 and +2.9
points at the 7B and 2B model scales, respectively. Notably, models trained
with B3 surpass existing state-of-the-art results even with a batch size as
small as 64, which is 4-16x smaller than that required by other methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CROC是一个自动化框架，用于评估文本到图像生成任务的评价指标，通过生成对比测试案例和数据集，揭示了现有指标的鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类评估方法成本高且耗时，自动化替代方案稀缺，因此需要开发一种可扩展的框架来评估评价指标的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CROC框架，通过合成对比测试案例生成伪标签数据集（CROC$^{syn}$），并训练新指标CROCScore。同时引入人工监督基准（CROC$^{hum}$）针对挑战性类别。

Result: CROCScore在开源方法中达到最优性能，同时揭示了现有指标的鲁棒性问题，例如否定提示和身体部位识别的失败率较高。

Conclusion: CROC框架为评价指标的鲁棒性评估提供了自动化解决方案，并展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The assessment of evaluation metrics (meta-evaluation) is crucial for
determining the suitability of existing metrics in text-to-image (T2I)
generation tasks. Human-based meta-evaluation is costly and time-intensive, and
automated alternatives are scarce. We address this gap and propose CROC: a
scalable framework for automated Contrastive Robustness Checks that
systematically probes and quantifies metric robustness by synthesizing
contrastive test cases across a comprehensive taxonomy of image properties.
With CROC, we generate a pseudo-labeled dataset (CROC$^{syn}$) of over one
million contrastive prompt-image pairs to enable a fine-grained comparison of
evaluation metrics. We also use the dataset to train CROCScore, a new metric
that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods,
demonstrating an additional key application of our framework. To complement
this dataset, we introduce a human-supervised benchmark (CROC$^{hum}$)
targeting especially challenging categories. Our results highlight robustness
issues in existing metrics: for example, many fail on prompts involving
negation, and all tested open-source metrics fail on at least 25% of cases
involving correct identification of body parts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在离线任务中表现良好，但在实时交互环境中需要生成语义准确且时序精确的语句，因此需要新的评估方法和模型。

Method: 提出了TGLG基准任务和TRACE评估指标，并开发了VLM-TSI模型，该模型通过时间同步交错视觉和语言令牌实现实时语言生成。

Result: VLM-TSI在TGLG任务中显著优于基线，但整体性能仍有提升空间，表明任务的挑战性。

Conclusion: TGLG任务和VLM-TSI模型为实时视觉语言模型研究提供了新方向，未来需进一步优化。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in offline tasks
such as image captioning and video question answering. However, real-time
interactive environments impose new demands on VLMs, requiring them to generate
utterances that are not only semantically accurate but also precisely timed. We
identify two core capabilities necessary for such settings --
$\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and
propose a new benchmark task, $\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation
(TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in
response to streaming video such that both content and timing align with
dynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets
from sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and
introduce a new metric, $\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring
semantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present
$\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$,
a model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized
manner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based
assumptions. Experimental results show that VLM-TSI significantly outperforms a
strong baseline, yet overall performance remains modest -- highlighting the
difficulty of TGLG and motivating further research in real-time VLMs. Code and

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，MARRS在生成协调且细粒度的反应动作上表现优异。

Conclusion: MARRS框架通过创新方法解决了现有技术的不足，为人类动作-反应合成任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This work aims at a challenging task: human action-reaction synthesis, i.e.,
generating human reactions based on the action sequence of the other as
conditions. Currently, autoregressive modeling approaches have achieved
remarkable performance in motion generation tasks, e.g. text-to-motion.
However, vector quantization (VQ) accompanying autoregressive generation has
inherent disadvantages, including loss of quantization information, low
codebook utilization, etc. Moreover, unlike text-to-motion, which focuses
solely on the movement of body joints, human action-reaction synthesis also
encompasses fine-grained hand movements. In this work, we propose MARRS, a
novel framework designed to generate coordinated and fine-grained reaction
motions in continuous representations. Initially, we present the
Unit-distinguished Motion Variational AutoEncoder (UD-VAE), which segments the
entire body into distinct body and hand units, encoding them independently.
Subsequently, we propose Action-Conditioned Fusion (ACF), which involves
randomly masking a subset of reactive tokens and extracting specific
information about the body and hands from the active tokens. Furthermore, we
introduce Adaptive Unit Modulation (AUM) to facilitate interaction between body
and hand units by using the information from one unit to adaptively modulate
the other. Finally, for the diffusion model, we employ a compact MLP as a noise
predictor for each distinct body unit and incorporate the diffusion loss to
model the probability distribution of each token. Quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

*Chenyu Huang,Peng Ye,Shenghe Zheng,Xiaohui Wang,Lei Bai,Tao Chen,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出动态基础模型转移（DBMS）方法，通过动态调整基础模型以优化任务性能，显著提升高压缩率下的模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用预训练模型作为基础模型并压缩增量参数，可能导致性能显著下降，尤其是在高压缩率下。

Method: 提出DBMS方法，动态调整基础模型以适应目标任务，并通过学习两个参数优化压缩性能。

Result: DBMS在高压缩率下仍能保持微调模型的大部分性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DBMS方法具有通用性，可与其他方法结合，适用于多种模型类型。

Abstract: Transformer-based models with the pretrain-finetune paradigm bring about
significant progress, along with the heavy storage and deployment costs of
finetuned models on multiple tasks. Delta compression attempts to lower the
costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference
between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights) through pruning or
quantization. However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model
as the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may
causes significant performance degradation, especially when the compression
rate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of
different base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the
pre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic
Base Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target
task before performing delta compression. Specifically, we adjust two
parameters, which respectively determine the magnitude of the base model shift
and the overall scale of delta compression, to boost the compression
performance on each task. Through low-cost learning of these two parameters,
our DBMS can maintain most of the finetuned model's performance even under an
extremely high compression ratio setting, significantly surpassing existing
methods. Moreover, our DBMS is orthogonal and can be integrated with a variety
of other methods, and it has been evaluated across different types of models
including language, vision transformer, and multi-modal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频-语言大模型（Video-VLMs）在VLN任务中表现优异，但在实际3D导航中仍面临3D几何理解不足、大规模探索能力有限和动态环境适应性差等挑战。

Method: Dynam3D通过将2D CLIP特征投影到3D空间，构建多层次的3D表示（补丁-实例-区域），并采用动态分层更新策略，实现3D几何和语义理解。

Result: Dynam3D在R2R-CE、REVERIE-CE和NavRAG-CE等VLN基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，并通过预探索、长期记忆和真实机器人实验验证了其实际部署的有效性。

Conclusion: Dynam3D通过动态分层3D表示和语言对齐的预训练，显著提升了VLN任务的性能，并展示了在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core task where embodied agents
leverage their spatial mobility to navigate in 3D environments toward
designated destinations based on natural language instructions. Recently,
video-language large models (Video-VLMs) with strong generalization
capabilities and rich commonsense knowledge have shown remarkable performance
when applied to VLN tasks. However, these models still encounter the following
challenges when applied to real-world 3D navigation: 1) Insufficient
understanding of 3D geometry and spatial semantics; 2) Limited capacity for
large-scale exploration and long-term environmental memory; 3) Poor
adaptability to dynamic and changing environments.To address these limitations,
we propose Dynam3D, a dynamic layered 3D representation model that leverages
language-aligned, generalizable, and hierarchical 3D representations as visual
input to train 3D-VLM in navigation action prediction. Given posed RGB-D
images, our Dynam3D projects 2D CLIP features into 3D space and constructs
multi-level 3D patch-instance-zone representations for 3D geometric and
semantic understanding with a dynamic and layer-wise update strategy. Our
Dynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and
dynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale
exploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging
large-scale 3D-language pretraining and task-specific adaptation, our Dynam3D
sets new state-of-the-art performance on VLN benchmarks including R2R-CE,
REVERIE-CE and NavRAG-CE under monocular settings. Furthermore, experiments for
pre-exploration, lifelong memory, and real-world robot validate the
effectiveness of practical deployment.

Result: 实验表明，MutualNeRF在有限样本下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MutualNeRF通过互信息理论有效提升了NeRF在数据受限场景中的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces MutualNeRF, a framework enhancing Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) performance under limited samples using Mutual Information Theory. While
NeRF excels in 3D scene synthesis, challenges arise with limited data and
existing methods that aim to introduce prior knowledge lack theoretical support
in a unified framework. We introduce a simple but theoretically robust concept,
Mutual Information, as a metric to uniformly measure the correlation between
images, considering both macro (semantic) and micro (pixel) levels.
  For sparse view sampling, we strategically select additional viewpoints
containing more non-overlapping scene information by minimizing mutual
information without knowing ground truth images beforehand. Our framework
employs a greedy algorithm, offering a near-optimal solution.
  For few-shot view synthesis, we maximize the mutual information between
inferred images and ground truth, expecting inferred images to gain more
relevant information from known images. This is achieved by incorporating
efficient, plug-and-play regularization terms.
  Experiments under limited samples show consistent improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines in different settings, affirming the efficacy of our
framework.

Motivation: 当前病理学领域的视觉语言模型在诊断准确性和推理合理性上存在不足，主要原因是数据集缺乏深度和结构化。

Method: 构建高质量数据集，采用三阶段训练流程：知识注入、监督微调和强化学习优化。

Result: Patho-R1和PathoCLIP在多项病理学任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Patho-R1通过高质量数据集和强化学习显著提升了病理学推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled broad progress
in the general medical field. However, pathology still remains a more
challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting
limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such
shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology
datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the
depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists.
In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts
to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we
introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a
three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs
for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality
Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement
learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and
Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning
quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we
propose PathoCLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued
pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both PathoCLIP
and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of
pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal
retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question. Our project

Result: 评估了38个模型，发现大多数模型存在情感幻觉问题，闭源模型表现优于开源模型，且推理能力提供额外优势。

Conclusion: 研究结果启发提出了PEP-MEK框架，显著提升了情感幻觉检测性能。

Abstract: Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Recent advances in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their
capabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations,
generating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge,
despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to
evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce
EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion
hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from
the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven
learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology
provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on
this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology
knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,
we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs
carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion
hallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on
EmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial
issues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform
open-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability
provides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion
psychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct,
these findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an
average improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected
models. Resources will be available at

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation of surgical tools in Robot-assisted Minimally
Invasive Surgery (RMIS) is essential for surgical navigation and robot control.
While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges
with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised
learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting
their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains,
zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation
of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical
tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation
pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D
models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by
incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for
robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments.
Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module,
Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly
boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive
validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in
zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new
benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the
generalisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the
application of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS.

TL;DR: HumaniBench是一个包含32K真实世界图像-问题对的基准测试，旨在评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在公平性、伦理、同理心等人类中心AI原则上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LMMs在视觉语言任务上表现优异，但在与人类价值观对齐的公平性、伦理等方面仍有不足。

Method: 通过GPT4辅助的标注流程和专家验证，构建了HumaniBench，涵盖7项HCAI原则和7种任务。

Result: 评估15种LMMs显示，专有模型表现较好，但开放模型在准确性与人类对齐原则间存在平衡问题。

Conclusion: HumaniBench为诊断LMMs与人类价值观的对齐差距提供了首个专门测试平台。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) now excel on many vision language benchmarks,
however, they still struggle with human centered criteria such as fairness,
ethics, empathy, and inclusivity, key to aligning with human values. We
introduce HumaniBench, a holistic benchmark of 32K real-world image question
pairs, annotated via a scalable GPT4o assisted pipeline and exhaustively
verified by domain experts. HumaniBench evaluates seven Human Centered AI
(HCAI) principles: fairness, ethics, understanding, reasoning, language
inclusivity, empathy, and robustness, across seven diverse tasks, including
open and closed ended visual question answering (VQA), multilingual QA, visual
grounding, empathetic captioning, and robustness tests. Benchmarking 15 state
of the art LMMs (open and closed source) reveals that proprietary models
generally lead, though robustness and visual grounding remain weak points. Some
open-source models also struggle to balance accuracy with adherence to
human-aligned principles. HumaniBench is the first benchmark purpose built
around HCAI principles. It provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing alignment
gaps and guiding LMMs toward behavior that is both accurate and socially
responsible. Dataset, annotation prompts, and evaluation code are available at:

TL;DR: PSDiffusion是一个统一的扩散框架，用于同时生成多层文本到图像，解决了现有方法在多层交互和全局一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多层图像生成方法无法处理层间交互（如全局布局、物理接触和视觉效果），同时保持高质量的透明度。

Method: 提出PSDiffusion框架，通过全局层交互机制，单次前馈过程生成多层图像（RGB背景和多个RGBA前景）。

Result: 模型能够同时生成高质量、完整的多层图像，并确保层间的空间和视觉交互以实现全局一致性。

Conclusion: PSDiffusion在多层图像生成中实现了高质量和全局一致性，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in generating high-quality
images from textual descriptions. Recent works like LayerDiffuse have extended
the previous single-layer, unified image generation paradigm to transparent
image layer generation. However, existing multi-layer generation methods fail
to handle the interactions among multiple layers such as rational global
layout, physics-plausible contacts and visual effects like shadows and
reflections while maintaining high alpha quality. To solve this problem, we
propose PSDiffusion, a unified diffusion framework for simultaneous multi-layer
text-to-image generation. Our model can automatically generate multi-layer
images with one RGB background and multiple RGBA foregrounds through a single
feed-forward process. Unlike existing methods that combine multiple tools for
post-decomposition or generate layers sequentially and separately, our method
introduces a global-layer interactive mechanism that generates layered-images
concurrently and collaboratively, ensuring not only high quality and
completeness for each layer, but also spatial and visual interactions among
layers for global coherence.

<details>

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在成像逆问题中因训练与测试图像分布偏移而性能下降的问题。

Method: 利用间接测量和不同数据集的扩散模型分数函数，提出无监督度量方法估计KL散度。

Result: 该度量方法仅通过损坏测量即可近似干净图像的KL散度，并提升重建质量。

Conclusion: 通过分数对齐减少分布偏移，改善了多种逆问题的重建效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used as priors in imaging inverse problems.
However, their performance often degrades under distribution shifts between the
training and test-time images. Existing methods for identifying and quantifying
distribution shifts typically require access to clean test images, which are
almost never available while solving inverse problems (at test time). We
propose a fully unsupervised metric for estimating distribution shifts using
only indirect (corrupted) measurements and score functions from diffusion
models trained on different datasets. We theoretically show that this metric
estimates the KL divergence between the training and test image distributions.
Empirically, we show that our score-based metric, using only corrupted
measurements, closely approximates the KL divergence computed from clean
images. Motivated by this result, we show that aligning the out-of-distribution
score with the in-distribution score -- using only corrupted measurements --
reduces the KL divergence and leads to improved reconstruction quality across
multiple inverse problems.

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如CLIP）缺乏精确性，无法全面衡量文本引导图像编辑模型的性能。

Method: 通过自动生成多选题验证功能正确性，并使用对象感知掩码技术评估图像内容保留。

Result: GPT-Image-1在指令跟随准确性上表现最佳，但会过度修改无关区域。

Conclusion: GIE-Bench为文本引导图像编辑提供了可扩展、可复现的评估框架。

Abstract: Editing images using natural language instructions has become a natural and
expressive way to modify visual content; yet, evaluating the performance of
such models remains challenging. Existing evaluation approaches often rely on
image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we
introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models
in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional
correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions
that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii)
image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the
image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and
preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing
examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed
editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the
text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing
models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show
that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often
over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the
current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework
for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.

TL;DR: QVGen是一种专为视频扩散模型设计的量化感知训练框架，通过辅助模块和秩衰减策略，在极低比特量化（如4位或更低）下实现高性能和高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算和内存需求高，直接量化效果不佳，需要一种专门的方法来优化其性能。

Method: 引入辅助模块（Φ）减少量化误差，并提出秩衰减策略逐步消除Φ，保留性能的同时消除推理开销。

Result: 在4位量化下，QVGen首次达到与全精度相当的质量，并在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QVGen为视频扩散模型的低比特量化提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet,
their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to
real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution,
quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while
its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we
present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for
high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit
quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis
demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate
convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to
mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced
convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a
rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we
repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based
regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing
components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference
overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs,
with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the
first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings.
Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our
3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and
$+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种协作奖励建模（CRM）框架，通过结合同行评审和课程学习，提高奖励模型在噪声偏好数据下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈中的噪声偏好会导致奖励模型过拟合虚假模式，从而在策略优化中提供误导信号。

Method: 提出CRM框架，通过并行训练两个奖励模型并互相评估数据选择，结合课程学习从易到难结构化偏好数据。

Result: 实验表明，CRM在40%标签噪声下在RewardBench上提升了9.94点准确率。

Conclusion: CRM是一种实用且通用的策略，能够提高奖励模型的泛化能力，并与隐式奖励对齐方法兼容。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values. However, noisy preferences in human feedback often lead to
reward misgeneralization, where RMs overfit to spurious patterns and provide
misleading signals during policy optimization. We systematically analyze the
training dynamics of preference pairs and identify that noisy examples are
harder to fit and introduce instability. Empirical evidence shows that LLMs
optimized using reward models trained on full noisy datasets perform worse than
those trained on filtered, high-quality preferences. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Reward Modeling (CRM), an online framework that enhances
robustness by combining peer review and curriculum learning. Two reward models
are trained in parallel and assess each other's data selections to filter out
potential noise. Curriculum learning structures the preference data from easy
to hard, ensuring synchronized training and stable feedback. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CRM improves generalization, with up to 9.94
points of accuracy gain on RewardBench under 40 percent label noise. CRM is
also compatible with implicit-reward alignment methods, offering a practical
and versatile strategy for robust alignment.

TL;DR: UDDETTS是一种结合离散和维度情感的神经编解码语言模型，用于可控情感TTS，解决了传统方法在情感复杂性和连续性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTS方法依赖离散情感标签，无法捕捉情感的复杂性和连续性，且缺乏平衡的大规模情感语音数据集。

Method: 提出UDDETTS模型，引入ADV空间描述维度情感，支持离散标签或ADV值驱动的情感控制，并设计半监督训练策略。

Result: 实验表明UDDETTS能沿ADV空间三个维度实现线性情感控制，并具有优越的情感语音合成能力。

Conclusion: UDDETTS为可控情感TTS提供了更灵活和有效的方法。

Abstract: Recent neural codec language models have made great progress in the field of
text-to-speech (TTS), but controllable emotional TTS still faces many
challenges. Traditional methods rely on predefined discrete emotion labels to
control emotion categories and intensities, which can't capture the complexity
and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of
large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and
fine-grained emotion annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models
and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose
UDDETTS, a neural codec language model unifying discrete and dimensional
emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the
interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion
description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion
labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised
training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech
datasets with different types of emotion annotations to train the UDDETTS.
Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along the three
dimensions of ADV space, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech
synthesis capabilities.

Conclusion: 混合采样技术与强健的模型和特征选择相结合，显著提升了物联网安全在不平衡数据环境中的防御能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) networks,
the cyber risk has increased exponentially, and therefore, we have to develop
effective IDS that can work well with highly imbalanced datasets. A high rate
of missed threats can be the result, as traditional machine learning models
tend to struggle in identifying attacks when normal data volume is much higher
than the volume of attacks. For example, the dataset used in this study reveals
a strong class imbalance with 94,659 instances of the majority class and only
28 instances of the minority class, making it quite challenging to determine
rare attacks accurately. The challenges presented in this research are
addressed by hybrid sampling techniques designed to improve data imbalance
detection accuracy in IoT domains. After applying these techniques, we evaluate
the performance of several machine learning models such as Random Forest, Soft
Voting, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression with respect to the classification of
cyber-attacks. The obtained results indicate that the Random Forest model
achieved the best performance with a Kappa score of 0.9903, test accuracy of
0.9961, and AUC of 0.9994. Strong performance is also shown by the Soft Voting
model, with an accuracy of 0.9952 and AUC of 0.9997, indicating the benefits of
combining model predictions. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of
hybrid sampling combined with robust model and feature selection for
significantly improving IoT security against cyber-attacks, especially in
highly imbalanced data environments.

Result: 证明了所有使用紧凑位置编码的Transformer都会出现隔离和连续性现象，且这些理论限制在实际中确实存在。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer在学习序列时的固有局限性，为进一步改进提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Understanding how Transformers work and how they process information is key
to the theoretical and empirical advancement of these machines. In this work,
we demonstrate the existence of two phenomena in Transformers, namely isolation
and continuity. Both of these phenomena hinder Transformers to learn even
simple pattern sequences. Isolation expresses that any learnable sequence must
be isolated from another learnable sequence, and hence some sequences cannot be
learned by a single Transformer at the same time. Continuity entails that an
attractor basin forms around a learned sequence, such that any sequence falling
in that basin will collapse towards the learned sequence. Here, we
mathematically prove these phenomena emerge in all Transformers that use
compact positional encoding, and design rigorous experiments, demonstrating
that the theoretical limitations we shed light on occur on the practical scale.

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，MONAQ发现的模型优于手工模型和NAS基线，且更高效。

Conclusion: MONAQ通过多模态输入和LLM的推理能力，为资源受限设备提供了一种高效的时间序列分析解决方案。

Abstract: The growing use of smartphones and IoT devices necessitates efficient
time-series analysis on resource-constrained hardware, which is critical for
sensing applications such as human activity recognition and air quality
prediction. Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS)
automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on
general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the
problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we
propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective
Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query
generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware
constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve
deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data,
time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's
understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate
that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS
baselines while being more efficient.

Conclusion: 论文统一并扩展了现有工作，为贝叶斯逆问题的样本复杂度提供了严格的理论保证，并揭示了相干性在贝叶斯恢复中的关键作用。

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of Bayesian recovery for solving inverse
problems with general prior, forward operator and noise distributions. We
consider posterior sampling according to an approximate prior $\mathcal{P}$,
and establish sufficient conditions for stable and accurate recovery with high
probability. Our main result is a non-asymptotic bound that shows that the
sample complexity depends on (i) the intrinsic complexity of $\mathcal{P}$,
quantified by its so-called approximate covering number, and (ii) concentration
bounds for the forward operator and noise distributions. As a key application,
we specialize to generative priors, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the pushforward of a
latent distribution via a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We show that the sample
complexity scales log-linearly with the latent dimension $k$, thus establishing
the efficacy of DNN-based priors. Generalizing existing results on
deterministic (i.e., non-Bayesian) recovery for the important problem of random
sampling with an orthogonal matrix $U$, we show how the sample complexity is
determined by the coherence of $U$ with respect to the support of
$\mathcal{P}$. Hence, we establish that coherence plays a fundamental role in
Bayesian recovery as well. Overall, our framework unifies and extends prior
work, providing rigorous guarantees for the sample complexity of solving
Bayesian inverse problems with arbitrary distributions.

Motivation: 测试数据分布偏移时，现有TTA方法忽视特征冗余问题，影响模型适应性。

Method: 提出S-FRET直接最小化特征冗余分数，并改进为G-FRET，结合GCN和对比学习。

Result: 实验证明S-FRET有效，G-FRET达到最优性能，提取非冗余且高判别性特征。

Conclusion: G-FRET通过减少冗余和增强判别性，实现更鲁棒的测试时适应。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the generalization of deep
learning models when faced with test data that exhibits distribution shifts
from the training data. In this context, only a pre-trained model and unlabeled
test data are available, making it particularly relevant for privacy-sensitive
applications. In practice, we observe that feature redundancy in embeddings
tends to increase as domain shifts intensify in TTA. However, existing TTA
methods often overlook this redundancy, which can hinder the model's
adaptability to new data. To address this issue, we introduce Feature
Redundancy Elimination for Test-time Adaptation (FRET), a novel perspective for
TTA. A straightforward approach (S-FRET) is to directly minimize the feature
redundancy score as an optimization objective to improve adaptation. Despite
its simplicity and effectiveness, S-FRET struggles with label shifts, limiting
its robustness in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, we further
propose Graph-based FRET (G-FRET), which integrates a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) with contrastive learning. This design not only reduces feature
redundancy but also enhances feature discriminability in both the
representation and prediction layers. Extensive experiments across multiple
model architectures, tasks, and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
S-FRET and show that G-FRET achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further
analysis reveals that G-FRET enables the model to extract non-redundant and
highly discriminative features during inference, thereby facilitating more
robust test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能上均有显著提升，适用于复杂视觉控制任务。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for visual
policy learning that leverages differentiable simulation and first-order
analytical policy gradients. Our approach decouple the rendering process from
the computation graph, enabling seamless integration with existing
differentiable simulation ecosystems without the need for specialized
differentiable rendering software. This decoupling not only reduces
computational and memory overhead but also effectively attenuates the policy
gradient norm, leading to more stable and smoother optimization. We evaluate
our method on standard visual control benchmarks using modern GPU-accelerated
simulation. Experiments show that our approach significantly reduces wall-clock
training time and consistently outperforms all baseline methods in terms of
final returns. Notably, on complex tasks such as humanoid locomotion, our
method achieves a $4\times$ improvement in final return, and successfully
learns a humanoid running policy within 4 hours on a single GPU.

Conclusion: IceMamba为季节性海冰预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案，有助于气候适应策略。

Abstract: The rapid decline of Arctic sea ice resulting from anthropogenic climate
change poses significant risks to indigenous communities, ecosystems, and the
global climate system. This situation emphasizes the immediate necessity for
precise seasonal sea ice forecasts. While dynamical models perform well for
short-term forecasts, they encounter limitations in long-term forecasts and are
computationally intensive. Deep learning models, while more computationally
efficient, often have difficulty managing seasonal variations and uncertainties
when dealing with complex sea ice dynamics. In this research, we introduce
IceMamba, a deep learning architecture that integrates sophisticated attention
mechanisms within the state space model. Through comparative analysis of 25
renowned forecast models, including dynamical, statistical, and deep learning
approaches, our experimental results indicate that IceMamba delivers excellent
seasonal forecasting capabilities for Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration.
Specifically, IceMamba outperforms all tested models regarding average RMSE and
anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and ranks second in Integrated Ice Edge
Error (IIEE). This innovative approach enhances our ability to foresee and
alleviate the effects of sea ice variability, offering essential insights for
strategies aimed at climate adaptation.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for assessing catastrophic

(CP)-based metric, termed the Conformal Prediction Confidence Factor (CPCF), to
quantify and evaluate CF effectively. Our framework leverages adaptive CP to
estimate forgetting by monitoring the model's confidence on previously learned
tasks. This approach provides a dynamic and practical solution for monitoring
and measuring CF of previous tasks as new ones are introduced, offering greater
suitability for real-world applications. Experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate a strong correlation between CPCF and the accuracy of
previous tasks, validating the reliability and interpretability of the proposed
metric. Our results highlight the potential of CPCF as a robust and effective

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统量化方法在动态输入下性能损失和计算开销大的问题。

Method: 使用概率模型对预激活进行建模，通过轻量级代理自适应调整量化参数。

Result: 在多个计算机视觉任务和模型上验证，性能损失可忽略，优于标准量化策略。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和计算开销之间取得了最佳平衡。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic framework for dynamic quantization of neural
networks that allows for a computationally efficient input-adaptive rescaling
of the quantization parameters. Our framework applies a probabilistic model to
the network's pre-activations through a lightweight surrogate, enabling the
adaptive adjustment of the quantization parameters on a per-input basis without
significant memory overhead. We validate our approach on a set of popular
computer vision tasks and models, observing only a negligible loss in
performance. Our method strikes the best performance and computational overhead
tradeoff compared to standard quantization strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在Gaussian噪声下，如何利用已知的侧信息矩阵优化多臂老虎机问题，涵盖标准老虎机、全反馈和图结构反馈等特例。

Method: 构建了一个基于线性规划（LP）的渐近实例依赖下界，优化了估计每个臂次优性差距所需的成本（遗憾）。

Result: 提出了一种针对这一通用设置的渐近最优算法。

Conclusion: 通过LP下界的启发，成功设计了一种适用于一般侧信息设置的渐近最优算法。

Abstract: We study the problem of Gaussian bandits with general side information, as
first introduced by Wu, Szepesvari, and Gyorgy. In this setting, the play of an
arm reveals information about other arms, according to an arbitrary a priori
known side information matrix: each element of this matrix encodes the fidelity
of the information that the ``row'' arm reveals about the ``column'' arm. In
the case of Gaussian noise, this model subsumes standard bandits,
full-feedback, and graph-structured feedback as special cases. In this work, we
first construct an LP-based asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the
regret. The LP optimizes the cost (regret) required to reliably estimate the
suboptimality gap of each arm. This LP lower bound motivates our main
contribution: the first known asymptotically optimal algorithm for this general
setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概率实体嵌入的聚类框架，用于解决屋顶光伏系统的高维时间序列数据集成与管理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着屋顶光伏系统安装数量的增加，如何高效集成和管理高维、空间分布且存在缺失值的时间序列数据成为挑战。

Method: 通过将每个光伏系统的发电模式和不确定性编码为概率分布，利用统计距离和凝聚聚类进行分组。

Result: 在多年度住宅光伏数据集上，该方法生成的聚类结果在代表性和鲁棒性上优于基于物理的基线方法，并支持可靠的缺失值填补。

Conclusion: 该框架为光伏系统数据管理提供了有效的解决方案，并通过超参数研究为模型性能与鲁棒性的平衡提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As the number of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations increases,
aggregators and system operators are required to monitor and analyze these
systems, raising the challenge of integration and management of large,
spatially distributed time-series data that are both high-dimensional and
affected by missing values. In this work, a probabilistic entity
embedding-based clustering framework is proposed to address these problems.
This method encodes each PV system's characteristic power generation patterns
and uncertainty as a probability distribution, then groups systems by their
statistical distances and agglomerative clustering. Applied to a multi-year
residential PV dataset, it produces concise, uncertainty-aware cluster profiles
that outperform a physics-based baseline in representativeness and robustness,
and support reliable missing-value imputation. A systematic hyperparameter
study further offers practical guidance for balancing model performance and
robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZEUS是一种零样本学习方法，用于无监督聚类表格数据，无需额外训练或调参，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据的聚类是一个开放性问题，相似性因数据集而异，且缺乏监督信号导致深度学习聚类方法不稳定。

Method: ZEUS通过分解数据集为有意义组件并预训练合成数据，实现零样本聚类。

Result: 实验表明，ZEUS性能与传统方法和深度学习方法相当或更好，速度更快且更易用。

Conclusion: ZEUS是首个零样本无监督表格数据聚类方法，具有高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Clustering tabular data remains a significant open challenge in data analysis
and machine learning. Unlike for image data, similarity between tabular records
often varies across datasets, making the definition of clusters highly
dataset-dependent. Furthermore, the absence of supervised signals complicates
hyperparameter tuning in deep learning clustering methods, frequently resulting
in unstable performance. To address these issues and reduce the need for
per-dataset tuning, we adopt an emerging approach in deep learning: zero-shot
learning. We propose ZEUS, a self-contained model capable of clustering new
datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. It operates by
decomposing complex datasets into meaningful components that can then be
clustered effectively. Thanks to pre-training on synthetic datasets generated
from a latent-variable prior, it generalizes across various datasets without
requiring user intervention. To the best of our knowledge, ZEUS is the first
zero-shot method capable of generating embeddings for tabular data in a fully
unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that it performs on par
with or better than traditional clustering algorithms and recent deep
learning-based methods, while being significantly faster and more
user-friendly.

TL;DR: GNN-Suite是一个模块化框架，用于构建和评估图神经网络（GNN）在计算生物学中的应用，通过标准化实验和可重复性来比较不同GNN架构的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决计算生物学中GNN架构评估的标准化问题，并提供一种公平比较不同模型性能的方法。

Method: 使用Nextflow工作流标准化实验，构建分子网络（基于STRING和BioGRID数据），并标注节点特征（来自PCAWG、PID和COSMIC-CGC）。比较多种GNN架构（如GAT、GCN等）和逻辑回归基线模型，统一训练参数和评估标准（平衡准确率）。

Result: GCN2在STRING网络中表现最佳（BACC 0.807），所有GNN均优于基线模型，表明基于网络的学习优于仅特征的方法。

Conclusion: GNN-Suite有助于识别最佳模型和数据整合方式，促进可重复研究和标准化基准测试。未来将扩展数据集并优化架构以提高预测准确性。

Abstract: We present GNN-Suite, a robust modular framework for constructing and
benchmarking Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures in computational biology.
GNN-Suite standardises experimentation and reproducibility using the Nextflow
workflow to evaluate GNN performance. We demonstrate its utility in identifying
cancer-driver genes by constructing molecular networks from protein-protein
interaction (PPI) data from STRING and BioGRID and annotating nodes with
features from the PCAWG, PID, and COSMIC-CGC repositories.
  Our design enables fair comparisons among diverse GNN architectures including
GAT, GAT3H, GCN, GCN2, GIN, GTN, HGCN, PHGCN, and GraphSAGE and a baseline
Logistic Regression (LR) model. All GNNs were configured as standardised
two-layer models and trained with uniform hyperparameters (dropout = 0.2; Adam
optimiser with learning rate = 0.01; and an adjusted binary cross-entropy loss
to address class imbalance) over an 80/20 train-test split for 300 epochs. Each
model was evaluated over 10 independent runs with different random seeds to
yield statistically robust performance metrics, with balanced accuracy (BACC)
as the primary measure. Notably, GCN2 achieved the highest BACC (0.807 +/-
0.035) on a STRING-based network, although all GNN types outperformed the LR
baseline, highlighting the advantage of network-based learning over
feature-only approaches.
  Our results show that a common framework for implementing and evaluating GNN
architectures aids in identifying not only the best model but also the most
effective means of incorporating complementary data. By making GNN-Suite
publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible research and promote improved
benchmarking standards in computational biology. Future work will explore
additional omics datasets and further refine network architectures to enhance
predictive accuracy and interpretability in biomedical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络方法仅能建模聚合物的单个单元，无法为具有不同重复单元数量的真实聚合物结构生成一致的向量表示。

Method: GRIN通过结合基于图的最大生成树对齐和重复单元增强，确保结构一致性。

Result: GRIN在均聚物和共聚物基准测试中优于现有方法，能够学习到稳定且重复单元数量不变的表示。

Conclusion: GRIN为聚合物表示学习提供了一种有效且理论支持的方法，能够推广到未见过的聚合物链尺寸。

Abstract: Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units
known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage,
construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network
methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of
polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true
polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we
introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer
representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their
graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree
alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We
provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and
data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal
augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer
benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that
generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.

Result: 随机客户端选择在CFL网络中能有效防御梯度攻击。

Conclusion: 研究结果为CFL系统提供了安全实施的见解，有助于开发更安全的协作学习框架。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has revolutionised collaborative machine
learning by enabling privacy-preserving model training across multiple parties.
However, it remains vulnerable to information leakage during intermediate
computation sharing. While Contrastive Federated Learning (CFL) was introduced
to mitigate these privacy concerns through representation learning, it still
faces challenges from gradient-based attacks. This paper presents a
comprehensive experimental analysis of gradient-based attacks in CFL
environments and evaluates random client selection as a defensive strategy.
Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that random client selection
proves particularly effective in defending against gradient attacks in the CFL
network. Our findings provide valuable insights for implementing robust
security measures in contrastive federated learning systems, contributing to
the development of more secure collaborative learning frameworks

Conclusion: DSO为科学发现中的符号优化提供了强大且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Symbolic Optimization (DSO) is a novel computational framework that
enables symbolic optimization for scientific discovery, particularly in
applications involving the search for intricate symbolic structures. One
notable example is equation discovery, which aims to automatically derive
mathematical models expressed in symbolic form. In DSO, the discovery process
is formulated as a sequential decision-making task. A generative neural network
learns a probabilistic model over a vast space of candidate symbolic
expressions, while reinforcement learning strategies guide the search toward
the most promising regions. This approach integrates gradient-based
optimization with evolutionary and local search techniques, and it incorporates
in-situ constraints, domain-specific priors, and advanced policy optimization
methods. The result is a robust framework capable of efficiently exploring
extensive search spaces to identify interpretable and physically meaningful
models. Extensive evaluations on benchmark problems have demonstrated that DSO
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability. In
this chapter, we provide a comprehensive overview of the DSO framework and
illustrate its transformative potential for automating symbolic optimization in
scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效整合外生文本并与LLM的概率特性对齐，限制了上下文感知和分布建模能力。

Method: CAPTime采用预训练时间序列编码器编码时间模式，通过可学习交互与文本对齐，结合混合分布专家和冻结LLM实现概率预测。

Result: 实验表明CAPTime在多模态任务中具有更高的准确性和泛化能力，且在数据稀缺情况下表现稳健。

Conclusion: CAPTime通过上下文感知和概率解码，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy
markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods
struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the
probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either
employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on
deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation
paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To
address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic
multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed
abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal
patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual
contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal
representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen
LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs'
inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series
forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of
CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights
its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.

Abstract: The composite current source (CCS) model has been adopted as an advanced
timing model that represents the current behavior of cells for improved
accuracy and better capability than traditional non-linear delay models (NLDM)
to model complex dynamic effects and interactions under advanced process nodes.
However, the high accuracy requirement, large amount of data and extensive
simulation cost pose severe challenges to CCS characterization. To address
these challenges, we introduce a novel Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) model
with active learning(AL) to establish the characterization framework
efficiently and accurately. Our approach significantly outperforms conventional
commercial tools as well as learning based approaches by achieving an average
absolute error of 2.05 ps and a relative error of 2.27% for current waveform of
57 cells under 9 process, voltage, temperature (PVT) corners with TSMC 22nm
process. Additionally, our model drastically reduces the runtime to 27% and the
storage by up to 19.5x compared with that required by commercial tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏和延迟奖励是现实世界强化学习应用的主要障碍，需要一种通用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: ARES利用Transformer的注意力机制，通过离线训练生成密集奖励函数，输入为片段及其最终回报。

Result: 实验表明，ARES在极端延迟奖励场景下显著提升学习效果，适用于低质量数据和多样化环境。

Conclusion: ARES是首个完全离线、鲁棒性强且不限于目标任务的奖励塑形方法。

Abstract: Sparse and delayed reward functions pose a significant obstacle for
real-world Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose
Attention-based REward Shaping (ARES), a general and robust algorithm which
uses a transformer's attention mechanism to generate shaped rewards and create
a dense reward function for any environment. ARES requires a set of episodes
and their final returns as input. It can be trained entirely offline and is
able to generate meaningful shaped rewards even when using small datasets or
episodes produced by agents taking random actions. ARES is compatible with any
RL algorithm and can handle any level of reward sparsity. In our experiments,
we focus on the most challenging case where rewards are fully delayed until the
end of each episode. We evaluate ARES across a diverse range of environments,
widely used RL algorithms, and baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
the shaped rewards it produces. Our results show that ARES can significantly
improve learning in delayed reward settings, enabling RL agents to train in
scenarios that would otherwise require impractical amounts of data or even be
unlearnable. To our knowledge, ARES is the first approach that works fully
offline, remains robust to extreme reward delays and low-quality data, and is
not limited to goal-based tasks.

Result: 学生模型重组、压缩或丢弃教师组件，更依赖少数组件；蒸馏保留功能行为但内部计算显著变化。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏虽能压缩模型并保留功能，但内部计算的变化可能影响模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation compresses a larger neural model (teacher) into
smaller, faster student models by training them to match teacher outputs.
However, the internal computational transformations that occur during this
process remain poorly understood. We apply techniques from mechanistic
interpretability to analyze how internal circuits, representations, and
activation patterns differ between teacher and student. Focusing on GPT2-small
and its distilled counterpart DistilGPT2, we find that student models
reorganize, compress, and discard teacher components, often resulting in
stronger reliance on fewer individual components. To quantify functional
alignment beyond output similarity, we introduce an alignment metric based on
influence-weighted component similarity, validated across multiple tasks. Our
findings reveal that while knowledge distillation preserves broad functional
behaviors, it also causes significant shifts in internal computation, with
important implications for the robustness and generalization capacity of
distilled models.

Abstract: Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by
combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling
efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task
data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited
in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their
applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we
introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model
merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language
models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five
key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding,
coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and
assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance,
forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide
practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that
model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques
such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge
retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost
on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task
models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training
pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to
advance the understanding and practical application of model merging. We open

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的攻击方法在离散语言空间中难以应用梯度优化，需要一种更高效的方法来发现LLM的漏洞。

Method: LARGO通过在LLM的连续潜在空间中优化对抗性潜在向量，并递归调用LLM将其解码为自然语言。

Result: 在AdvBench和JailbreakBench基准测试中，LARGO的攻击成功率比现有最佳方法（如AutoDAN）高出44个百分点。

Conclusion: LARGO展示了通过梯度优化攻击LLM内部的有效性，为越狱攻击提供了新的高效方法。

Abstract: Efficient red-teaming method to uncover vulnerabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial. While recent attacks often use LLMs as optimizers,
the discrete language space make gradient-based methods struggle. We introduce
LARGO (Latent Adversarial Reflection through Gradient Optimization), a novel
latent self-reflection attack that reasserts the power of gradient-based
optimization for generating fluent jailbreaking prompts. By operating within
the LLM's continuous latent space, LARGO first optimizes an adversarial latent
vector and then recursively call the same LLM to decode the latent into natural
language. This methodology yields a fast, effective, and transferable attack
that produces fluent and stealthy prompts. On standard benchmarks like AdvBench
and JailbreakBench, LARGO surpasses leading jailbreaking techniques, including
AutoDAN, by 44 points in attack success rate. Our findings demonstrate a potent
alternative to agentic LLM prompting, highlighting the efficacy of interpreting
and attacking LLM internals through gradient optimization.

Result: 实验表明，Ready2Unlearn能减少删除时间、保留模型能力并防止被删除数据意外恢复。

Conclusion: Ready2Unlearn为机器学习模型提供了主动的删除准备策略，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces Ready2Unlearn, a learning-time optimization approach
designed to facilitate future unlearning processes. Unlike the majority of
existing unlearning efforts that focus on designing unlearning algorithms,
which are typically implemented reactively when an unlearning request is made
during the model deployment phase, Ready2Unlearn shifts the focus to the
training phase, adopting a "forward-looking" perspective. Building upon
well-established meta-learning principles, Ready2Unlearn proactively trains
machine learning models with unlearning readiness, such that they are well
prepared and can handle future unlearning requests in a more efficient and
principled manner. Ready2Unlearn is model-agnostic and compatible with any
gradient ascent-based machine unlearning algorithms. We evaluate the method on
both vision and language tasks under various unlearning settings, including
class-wise unlearning and random data unlearning. Experimental results show
that by incorporating such preparedness at training time, Ready2Unlearn
produces an unlearning-ready model state, which offers several key advantages
when future unlearning is required, including reduced unlearning time, improved
retention of overall model capability, and enhanced resistance to the
inadvertent recovery of forgotten data. We hope this work could inspire future
efforts to explore more proactive strategies for equipping machine learning
models with built-in readiness towards more reliable and principled machine
unlearning.

Conclusion: FairSHAP是一种模型无关、透明的方法，可无缝集成到现有机器学习流程中。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, particularly in
high-stakes domains where biased decisions can lead to serious societal
consequences. Existing preprocessing approaches generally lack transparent
mechanisms for identifying which features or instances are responsible for
unfairness. This obscures the rationale behind data modifications. We introduce
FairSHAP, a novel pre-processing framework that leverages Shapley value
attribution to improve both individual and group fairness. FairSHAP identifies
fairness-critical instances in the training data using an interpretable measure
of feature importance, and systematically modifies them through instance-level
matching across sensitive groups. This process reduces discriminative risk - an
individual fairness metric - while preserving data integrity and model
accuracy. We demonstrate that FairSHAP significantly improves demographic
parity and equality of opportunity across diverse tabular datasets, achieving
fairness gains with minimal data perturbation and, in some cases, improved
predictive performance. As a model-agnostic and transparent method, FairSHAP
integrates seamlessly into existing machine learning pipelines and provides
actionable insights into the sources of bias.Our code is on

*Jiacheng Liang,Tanqiu Jiang,Yuhui Wang,Rongyi Zhu,Fenglong Ma,Ting Wang*

TL;DR: AutoRAN是一个自动化框架，利用弱对齐的推理模型攻击强推理模型，通过迭代优化提示实现高成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示强推理模型的关键漏洞，强调需要针对推理模型改进安全措施。

Method: 利用弱对齐模型模拟目标模型的高层推理结构，生成并迭代优化提示。

Result: 在多种基准数据集上对GPT-o3/o4-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash等模型实现接近100%的成功率。

Conclusion: 弱推理模型可有效攻击强推理模型，需加强推理模型的安全设计。

Abstract: This paper presents AutoRAN, the first automated, weak-to-strong jailbreak
attack framework targeting large reasoning models (LRMs). At its core, AutoRAN
leverages a weak, less-aligned reasoning model to simulate the target model's
high-level reasoning structures, generates narrative prompts, and iteratively
refines candidate prompts by incorporating the target model's intermediate
reasoning steps. We evaluate AutoRAN against state-of-the-art LRMs including
GPT-o3/o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash across multiple benchmark datasets
(AdvBench, HarmBench, and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that AutoRAN
achieves remarkable success rates (approaching 100%) within one or a few turns
across different LRMs, even when judged by a robustly aligned external model.
This work reveals that leveraging weak reasoning models can effectively exploit
the critical vulnerabilities of much more capable reasoning models,
highlighting the need for improved safety measures specifically designed for
reasoning-based models. The code for replicating AutoRAN and running records
are available at: (https://github.com/JACKPURCELL/AutoRAN-public). (warning:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练的统一基础模型，用于质谱数据的多任务分析，通过去新测序预训练提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱数据复杂且需要高效计算分析，机器学习虽已广泛应用，但缺乏统一模型。

Method: 预训练质谱编码器（去新测序任务），并在四个下游任务上微调。

Result: 预训练模型提升了质谱质量、嵌合性、磷酸化和糖基化状态预测的性能。

Conclusion: 基础模型能学习通用质谱表示，提升数据有限任务的表现，优化蛋白质组学实验。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry is the dominant technology in the field of proteomics,
enabling high-throughput analysis of the protein content of complex biological
samples. Due to the complexity of the instrumentation and resulting data,
sophisticated computational methods are required for the processing and
interpretation of acquired mass spectra. Machine learning has shown great
promise to improve the analysis of mass spectrometry data, with numerous
purpose-built methods for improving specific steps in the data acquisition and
analysis pipeline reaching widespread adoption. Here, we propose unifying
various spectrum prediction tasks under a single foundation model for mass
spectra. To this end, we pre-train a spectrum encoder using de novo sequencing
as a pre-training task. We then show that using these pre-trained spectrum
representations improves our performance on the four downstream tasks of
spectrum quality prediction, chimericity prediction, phosphorylation
prediction, and glycosylation status prediction. Finally, we perform multi-task
fine-tuning and find that this approach improves the performance on each task
individually. Overall, our work demonstrates that a foundation model for tandem
mass spectrometry proteomics trained on de novo sequencing learns generalizable
representations of spectra, improves performance on downstream tasks where
training data is limited, and can ultimately enhance data acquisition and
analysis in proteomics experiments.

TL;DR: ImputeINR提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的时间序列插值方法，能有效处理高缺失率数据，并在医疗数据下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据中常存在大量缺失值，现有插值方法对稀疏数据建模效果差，尤其在高缺失率情况下表现不佳。

Method: 利用隐式神经表示（INR）学习时间序列的连续函数，实现与采样频率无关的细粒度插值。

Result: 在八个数据集和五种缺失率下的实验表明，ImputeINR在高缺失率时间序列数据中表现优越。

Conclusion: ImputeINR不仅提升了插值性能，还显著改善了医疗数据下游疾病诊断任务的准确性。

Abstract: Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing
values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream
disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete
data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in
particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by
employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions
for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous
functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling
frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on
extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight
datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation
performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series
data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values
in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis
tasks. Codes are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DeepSeekMoE在DeepSeek系列模型中表现突出，但其共享专家策略和归一化Sigmoid门控机制的理论价值尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过统计视角对共享专家策略和归一化Sigmoid门控机制进行收敛分析，并在合成数据和真实数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明，这两种机制在样本效率上具有优势；实验验证了理论发现，并对路由器行为进行了详细分析。

Conclusion: 研究为专家和门控结构的设计提供了理论支持，并展示了DeepSeekMoE的优越性。

Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) methods are a key component in most large language
model architectures, including the recent series of DeepSeek models. Compared
to other MoE implementations, DeepSeekMoE stands out because of two unique
features: the deployment of a shared expert strategy and of the normalized
sigmoid gating mechanism. Despite the prominent role of DeepSeekMoE in the
success of the DeepSeek series of models, there have been only a few attempts
to justify theoretically the value of the shared expert strategy, while its
normalized sigmoid gating has remained unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
undertake a comprehensive theoretical study of these two features of
DeepSeekMoE from a statistical perspective. We perform a convergence analysis
of the expert estimation task to highlight the gains in sample efficiency for
both the shared expert strategy and the normalized sigmoid gating, offering
useful insights into the design of expert and gating structures. To verify
empirically our theoretical findings, we carry out several experiments on both
synthetic data and real-world datasets for (vision) language modeling tasks.
Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the router behaviors,
ranging from router saturation, router change rate, to expert utilization.

Result: 在CartPole和Pendulum等环境中，LORO的累积奖励比纯RL基线高4倍。

Conclusion: LORO结合LLM和RL的优势，既能收敛到最优策略，又具有高样本效率。

Abstract: We investigate the usage of Large Language Model (LLM) in collecting
high-quality data to warm-start Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for
learning in some classical Markov Decision Process (MDP) environments. In this
work, we focus on using LLM to generate an off-policy dataset that sufficiently
covers state-actions visited by optimal policies, then later using an RL
algorithm to explore the environment and improve the policy suggested by the
LLM. Our algorithm, LORO, can both converge to an optimal policy and have a
high sample efficiency thanks to the LLM's good starting policy. On multiple
OpenAI Gym environments, such as CartPole and Pendulum, we empirically
demonstrate that LORO outperforms baseline algorithms such as pure LLM-based
policies, pure RL, and a naive combination of the two, achieving up to $4
\times$ the cumulative rewards of the pure RL baseline.

Abstract: We focus on the problem of identifying samples in a set that do not conform
to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. An effective
way to solve this problem is to embed data in a high dimensional space, called
Preference Space, where anomalies can be identified as the most isolated
points. In this work, we employ Locality Sensitive Hashing to avoid explicit

Motivation: 解决在噪声和异常值污染的数据集中恢复多种几何结构的问题，特别是由参数模型混合定义的结构（如平面、圆柱体、单应性和基本矩阵）。

Method: 通过偏好分析和聚类进行鲁棒拟合，MultiLink算法结合了即时模型拟合和模型选择，采用新的链接方案决定是否合并两个聚类。

Result: 实验表明，MultiLink在速度和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，对异常值阈值不敏感，并能弥补假设采样的局限性。

Conclusion: MultiLink在多类别和单类别问题中均优于现有方法，代码已公开。

Abstract: We address the problem of recovering multiple structures of different classes
in a dataset contaminated by noise and outliers. In particular, we consider
geometric structures defined by a mixture of underlying parametric models (e.g.
planes and cylinders, homographies and fundamental matrices), and we tackle the
robust fitting problem by preference analysis and clustering. We present a new
algorithm, termed MultiLink, that simultaneously deals with multiple classes of
models. MultiLink combines on-the-fly model fitting and model selection in a
novel linkage scheme that determines whether two clusters are to be merged. The
resulting method features many practical advantages with respect to methods
based on preference analysis, being faster, less sensitive to the inlier
threshold, and able to compensate limitations deriving from hypotheses
sampling. Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that Multi-Link
favourably compares with state of the art alternatives, both in multi-class and
single-class problems. Code is publicly made available for download.

Conclusion: PIF框架在异常检测中表现出高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting anomalies as samples that do not conform
to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. To this end,
we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation
Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods
with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the
data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional
manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three
isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most
general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of
distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a
locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在数据稀缺时容易过拟合，高斯过程（GPs）作为一种替代方法，但需扩展至更复杂的图结构（如单纯复形）以提升预测能力。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多种应用中提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为高斯过程在图和单纯复形预测中的广泛应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting the labels of graph-structured data is crucial in scientific
applications and is often achieved using graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
when data is scarce, GNNs suffer from overfitting, leading to poor performance.
Recently, Gaussian processes (GPs) with graph-level inputs have been proposed
as an alternative. In this work, we extend the Gaussian process framework to
simplicial complexes (SCs), enabling the handling of edge-level attributes and
attributes supported on higher-order simplices. We further augment the
resulting SC representations by considering their Hodge decompositions,
allowing us to account for homological information, such as the number of
holes, in the SC. We demonstrate that our framework enhances the predictions
across various applications, paving the way for GPs to be more widely used for
graph and SC-level predictions.

Motivation: 研究SGMs在估计未知分布时的性能，特别是在较弱的假设条件下（如仅要求分布是α-次高斯分布），填补现有研究的不足。

Method: 使用深度ReLU神经网络，通过分数匹配损失衡量，证明了网络在特定时间步长内能近似分数并达到接近最优的收敛速率。

Result: 在α-次高斯分布假设下，SGMs能以接近最优的速率收敛，且在Sobolev或Besov类密度函数下，通过早期停止策略达到接近极小极大收敛速率。

Conclusion: SGMs在较温和假设下仍能高效估计未知分布，去除了对分数函数Lipschitz连续性和目标密度严格正下界的关键假设。

Abstract: This paper studies the approximation and generalization abilities of
score-based neural network generative models (SGMs) in estimating an unknown
distribution $P_0$ from $n$ i.i.d. observations in $d$ dimensions. Assuming
merely that $P_0$ is $\alpha$-sub-Gaussian, we prove that for any time step $t
\in [t_0, n^{O(1)}]$, where $t_0 \geq O(\alpha^2n^{-2/d}\log n)$, there exists
a deep ReLU neural network with width $\leq O(\log^3n)$ and depth $\leq
O(n^{3/d}\log_2n)$ that can approximate the scores with $\tilde{O}(n^{-1})$
mean square error and achieve a nearly optimal rate of
$\tilde{O}(n^{-1}t_0^{-d/2})$ for score estimation, as measured by the score
matching loss. Our framework is universal and can be used to establish
convergence rates for SGMs under milder assumptions than previous work. For
example, assuming further that the target density function $p_0$ lies in
Sobolev or Besov classes, with an appropriately early stopping strategy, we
demonstrate that neural network-based SGMs can attain nearly minimax
convergence rates up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis removes several
crucial assumptions, such as Lipschitz continuity of the score function or a
strictly positive lower bound on the target density.

Method: 提出Prior Guidance (PG)框架，用可学习的分布替代标准高斯先验，并通过行为正则化目标优化。

Result: PG在多样化的长时程离线强化学习基准测试中表现优于现有扩散策略和规划器。

Conclusion: PG是一种高效且性能优越的方法，能够直接生成高价值轨迹，无需昂贵的奖励优化或多候选采样。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement
learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing,
generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners
facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories
through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However,
existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance,
Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce
suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur
prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior
Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard
Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable
distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly
generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the
diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates
at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy
that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically
demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and
planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统PCA方法在高维空间中计算成本高，而Oja算法等子空间跟踪方法需要全维观测。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出一种变体，每次迭代仅采集两个压缩测量：一个沿当前估计方向，一个沿随机正交方向。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为带噪声子空间跟踪的自适应感知提供了收敛保证，对高维数据应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of efficient principal component analysis
(PCA) in high-dimensional spaces by analyzing a compressively sampled variant
of Oja's algorithm with adaptive sensing. Traditional PCA methods incur
substantial computational costs that scale poorly with data dimensionality,
whereas subspace tracking algorithms like Oja's offer more efficient
alternatives but typically require full-dimensional observations. We analyze a
variant where, at each iteration, only two compressed measurements are taken:
one in the direction of the current estimate and one in a random orthogonal
direction. We prove that this adaptive sensing approach achieves global
convergence in the presence of noise when tracking the leading eigenvector of a
datastream with eigengap $\Delta=\lambda_1-\lambda_2$. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that the algorithm experiences two phases: (1) a warmup phase
requiring $O(\lambda_1\lambda_2d^2/\Delta^2)$ iterations to achieve a
constant-level alignment with the true eigenvector, followed by (2) a local
convergence phase where the sine alignment error decays at a rate of
$O(\lambda_1\lambda_2d^2/\Delta^2 t)$ for iterations $t$. The guarantee aligns
with existing minimax lower bounds with an added factor of $d$ due to the
compressive sampling. This work provides the first convergence guarantees in
adaptive sensing for subspace tracking with noise. Our proof technique is also
considerably simpler than those in prior works. The results have important
implications for applications where acquiring full-dimensional samples is
challenging or costly.

Motivation: 现有偏好优化技术仅适用于单一目标，而实际用户需求是多目标的，需解决多目标对齐问题。

Method: 提出MOPO算法，通过约束KL正则化优化，直接处理成对偏好数据，无需点奖励假设或启发式提示工程。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，MOPO能逼近Pareto前沿，优于基线方法，且对超参数鲁棒。

Conclusion: MOPO有效解决多目标对齐问题，适用于大规模训练，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Post-training of LLMs with RLHF, and subsequently preference optimization
algorithms such as DPO, IPO, etc., made a big difference in improving human
alignment. However, all such techniques can only work with a single (human)
objective. In practice, human users have multiple objectives, such as
helpfulness and harmlessness, and there is no natural way to aggregate them
into a single objective. In this paper, we address the multi-objective
preference-alignment problem, where a policy must optimize several, potentially
conflicting, objectives. We introduce the Multi-Objective Preference
Optimization (MOPO) algorithm, which frames alignment as a constrained
KL-regularized optimization: the primary objective is maximized while secondary
objectives are lower-bounded by tunable safety thresholds. Unlike prior work,
MOPO operates directly on pairwise preference data, requires no point-wise
reward assumption, and avoids heuristic prompt-context engineering. The method
recovers policies on the Pareto front whenever the front is attainable;
practically, it reduces to simple closed-form iterative updates suitable for
large-scale training. On synthetic benchmarks with diverse canonical preference
structures, we show that MOPO approximates the Pareto front. When fine-tuning a
1.3B-parameter language model on real-world human-preference datasets, MOPO
attains higher rewards and yields policies that Pareto-dominate baselines;
ablation studies confirm optimization stability and robustness to
hyperparameters.

Abstract: This paper proposes CTP, a novel deep learning framework that integrates
convolutional neural network(CNN), Transformer architectures, and
physics-informed neural network(PINN) for ocean front prediction. Ocean fronts,
as dynamic interfaces between distinct water masses, play critical roles in
marine biogeochemical and physical processes. Existing methods such as LSTM,
ConvLSTM, and AttentionConv often struggle to maintain spatial continuity and
physical consistency over multi-step forecasts. CTP addresses these challenges
by combining localized spatial encoding, long-range temporal attention, and
physical constraint enforcement. Experimental results across south China
sea(SCS) and Kuroshio(KUR) regions from 1993 to 2020 demonstrate that CTP
achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance in both single-step and multi-step
predictions, significantly outperforming baseline models in accuracy, $F_1$
score, and temporal stability.

Abstract: In Computer Science (CS) education, understanding factors contributing to
students' programming difficulties is crucial for effective learning support.
By identifying specific issues students face, educators can provide targeted
assistance to help them overcome obstacles and improve learning outcomes. While
identifying sources of struggle, such as misconceptions, in real-time can be
challenging in current educational practices, analyzing logical errors in
students' code can offer valuable insights. This paper presents a scalable
framework for automatically detecting logical errors in students' programming
solutions. Our framework is based on an explainable Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
embedding model, the Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN), that
identifies the structural components of programs containing logical errors. We
conducted a series of experiments to evaluate its effectiveness, and the
results suggest that our framework can accurately capture students' logical
errors and, more importantly, provide us with deeper insights into their
learning processes, offering a valuable tool for enhancing programming
education.

dimensions--for instance, navigating an unfamiliar city involves planning
itineraries that sequence locations and timing cultural experiences. However,
existing Question-Answering (QA) datasets lack sufficient
spatiotemporal-sensitive questions, making them inadequate benchmarks for
evaluating models' spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce POI-QA, a novel spatiotemporal-sensitive QA dataset centered on
Point of Interest (POI), constructed through three key steps: mining and
aligning open-source vehicle trajectory data from GAIA with high-precision
geographic POI data, rigorous manual validation of noisy spatiotemporal facts,
and generating bilingual (Chinese/English) QA pairs that reflect
human-understandable spatiotemporal reasoning tasks. Our dataset challenges
models to parse complex spatiotemporal dependencies, and evaluations of
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B) reveal stark
limitations: even the top-performing model (Qwen2.5-7B fine-tuned with
RAG+LoRA) achieves a top 10 Hit Ratio (HR@10) of only 0.41 on the easiest task,
far below human performance at 0.56. This underscores persistent weaknesses in
LLMs' ability to perform consistent spatiotemporal reasoning, while
highlighting POI-QA as a robust benchmark to advance algorithms sensitive to
spatiotemporal dynamics. The dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PITA的自监督学习框架，通过物理约束解决自回归PDE基础模型中的误差累积问题，显著提升了模型的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归PDE基础模型在处理时间依赖性数据时存在误差累积的捷径问题，尤其在分布外数据上表现不佳。

Method: 提出PITA框架，通过物理约束自监督信号对齐不同时间步的物理动态，无需依赖已知物理先验。

Result: 实验表明PITA显著提升了现有基础模型在多种时间依赖性PDE数据上的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PITA通过自监督学习有效解决了自回归PDE模型的误差累积问题，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Auto-regressive partial differential equation (PDE) foundation models have
shown great potential in handling time-dependent data. However, these models
suffer from the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction,
causing error accumulation. The challenge becomes particularly evident for
out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random
model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with
this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a
self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving.
Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time
steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints
into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation
data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization
ability to the out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA
significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation
models on diverse time-dependent PDE data. The code is available at

TL;DR: PALL提出了一种隐私感知的终身学习方法，结合稀疏子网络和记忆机制，实现高效学习和选择性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决终身学习和机器遗忘之间的矛盾需求，满足数据隐私法规要求。

Method: 通过优化任务特定的稀疏子网络和参数共享，结合记忆机制实现精确遗忘。

Result: 在图像分类任务中验证了PALL的可扩展性和高效性。

Conclusion: PALL为负责任AI提供了一种结合终身学习和隐私遗忘的先进解决方案。

Abstract: Lifelong learning algorithms enable models to incrementally acquire new
knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Contrarily, the
field of machine unlearning focuses on explicitly forgetting certain previous
knowledge from pretrained models when requested, in order to comply with data
privacy regulations on the right-to-be-forgotten. Enabling efficient lifelong
learning with the capability to selectively unlearn sensitive information from
models presents a critical and largely unaddressed challenge with contradicting
objectives. We address this problem from the perspective of simultaneously
preventing catastrophic forgetting and allowing forward knowledge transfer
during task-incremental learning, while ensuring exact task unlearning and
minimizing memory requirements, based on a single neural network model to be
adapted. Our proposed solution, privacy-aware lifelong learning (PALL),
involves optimization of task-specific sparse subnetworks with parameter
sharing within a single architecture. We additionally utilize an episodic
memory rehearsal mechanism to facilitate exact unlearning without performance
degradations. We empirically demonstrate the scalability of PALL across various
architectures in image classification, and provide a state-of-the-art solution
that uniquely integrates lifelong learning and privacy-aware unlearning
mechanisms for responsible AI applications.

### [197] [Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10947)
*Kehan Long,Jorge Cortés,Nikolay Atanasov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过增强RL价值函数和神经网络残差项来学习广义Lyapunov函数的方法，用于验证学习控制策略的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Lyapunov方法难以适用于学习控制策略，因此需要一种更灵活的方法来验证稳定性。

Method: 通过线性二次调节器（LQR）问题获得直觉，提出广义Lyapunov条件，并结合神经网络残差项学习Lyapunov函数。

Result: 成功验证了Gymnasium和DeepMind Control基准上的RL策略稳定性，并扩展了吸引区域的认证范围。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习控制策略的稳定性认证提供了一种更灵活的方式，连接了经典控制理论和现代学习方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of certifying the stability of closed-loop systems under
control policies derived from optimal control or reinforcement learning (RL).
Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict step-wise decrease in the Lyapunov
function but such a certificate is difficult to construct for a learned control
policy. The value function associated with an RL policy is a natural Lyapunov
function candidate but it is not clear how it should be modified. To gain
intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make
two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value
function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the
system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease
requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only
decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider
the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov
functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms.
Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on
Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly
train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov
loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of
attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our
formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with
learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging
classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs的失败模式通常归因于局部最优解，但研究发现实际原因是算术精度不足（FP32）。改用FP64后，优化成功，解决了PDE问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，揭示PINNs失败模式的真正原因是数值精度不足而非局部最优解。

Method: 通过比较FP32和FP64精度下的优化表现，分析PINNs的训练动态。

Result: FP64精度下，LBFGS优化器成功避免了失败模式，解决了PDE问题。

Conclusion: 算术精度是神经网络可靠求解PDE的关键因素，FP64能有效避免优化停滞。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often exhibit failure modes in which
the PDE residual loss converges while the solution error stays large, a
phenomenon traditionally blamed on local optima separated from the true
solution by steep loss barriers. We challenge this understanding by demonstrate
that the real culprit is insufficient arithmetic precision: with standard FP32,
the LBFGS optimizer prematurely satisfies its convergence test, freezing the
network in a spurious failure phase. Simply upgrading to FP64 rescues
optimization, enabling vanilla PINNs to solve PDEs without any failure modes.
These results reframe PINN failure modes as precision induced stalls rather
than inescapable local minima and expose a three stage training dynamic
unconverged, failure, success whose boundaries shift with numerical precision.
Our findings emphasize that rigorous arithmetic precision is the key to
dependable PDE solving with neural networks.

TL;DR: SD²是一种基于扩散模型的生成式隐写方法，通过结合比特位锁定和扩散采样注入，实现了在生成过程中精确嵌入信息，平衡了安全性、容量和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间和频域隐写方法在安全性、容量和感知质量之间存在权衡，扩散模型为自适应图像合成提供了新途径，但精确信息嵌入仍具挑战性。

Method: SD²结合比特位锁定和扩散采样注入，利用扩散模型的表达能力合成多样载体图像，同时确保100%信息恢复。

Result: SD²在安全性、嵌入容量和稳定性上显著优于现有方法，且不影响图像保真度。

Conclusion: SD²为可控生成提供了新思路，并为安全视觉通信开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Data steganography aims to conceal information within visual content, yet
existing spatial- and frequency-domain approaches suffer from trade-offs
between security, capacity, and perceptual quality. Recent advances in
generative models, particularly diffusion models, offer new avenues for
adaptive image synthesis, but integrating precise information embedding into
the generative process remains challenging. We introduce Shackled Dancing
Diffusion, or SD$^2$, a plug-and-play generative steganography method that
combines bit-position locking with diffusion sampling injection to enable
controllable information embedding within the generative trajectory. SD$^2$
leverages the expressive power of diffusion models to synthesize diverse
carrier images while maintaining full message recovery with $100\%$ accuracy.
Our method achieves a favorable balance between randomness and constraint,
enhancing robustness against steganalysis without compromising image fidelity.
Extensive experiments show that SD$^2$ substantially outperforms prior methods
in security, embedding capacity, and stability. This algorithm offers new
insights into controllable generation and opens promising directions for secure
visual communication.

Motivation: 针对不同查询可能检索到相似子图的问题，提出SubGCache以减少计算开销。

Method: 聚类查询基于子图嵌入，为每个聚类构建代表性子图并预计算其KV缓存，查询时直接复用。

Result: 实验表明，SubGCache在保持生成质量的同时，推理延迟降低高达6.68倍。

Conclusion: SubGCache有效提升了图检索增强生成的效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to incorporate structured knowledge via graph retrieval as
contextual input, enhancing more accurate and context-aware reasoning. We
observe that for different queries, it could retrieve similar subgraphs as
prompts, and thus we propose SubGCache, which aims to reduce inference latency
by reusing computation across queries with similar structural prompts (i.e.,
subgraphs). Specifically, SubGCache clusters queries based on subgraph
embeddings, constructs a representative subgraph for each cluster, and
pre-computes the key-value (KV) cache of the representative subgraph. For each
query with its retrieved subgraph within a cluster, it reuses the pre-computed
KV cache of the representative subgraph of the cluster without computing the KV
tensors again for saving computation. Experiments on two new datasets across
multiple LLM backbones and graph-based RAG frameworks demonstrate that
SubGCache consistently reduces inference latency with comparable and even
improved generation quality, achieving up to 6.68$\times$ reduction in
time-to-first-token (TTFT).

Result: CPBO成功通过探索可行区域找到最优解，并在广告设计应用中验证其潜力。

Conclusion: CPBO为带约束的偏好优化提供了有效解决方案，适用于实际场景如广告设计。

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) is a variant of Bayesian
optimization that observes relative preferences (e.g., pairwise comparisons)
instead of direct objective values, making it especially suitable for
human-in-the-loop scenarios. However, real-world optimization tasks often
involve inequality constraints, which existing PBO methods have not yet
addressed. To fill this gap, we propose constrained preferential Bayesian
optimization (CPBO), an extension of PBO that incorporates inequality
constraints for the first time. Specifically, we present a novel acquisition
function for this purpose. Our technical evaluation shows that our CPBO method
successfully identifies optimal solutions by focusing on exploring feasible
regions. As a practical application, we also present a designer-in-the-loop
system for banner ad design using CPBO, where the objective is the designer's
subjective preference, and the constraint ensures a target predicted
click-through rate. We conducted a user study with professional ad designers,
demonstrating the potential benefits of our approach in guiding creative design
under real-world constraints.

Motivation: 传统GNN在捕捉关系数据的复杂结构和长程依赖方面存在局限，而现有图变换器在关系实体图上的应用面临位置编码、时间动态性和结构信息丢失等挑战。

Method: RelGT采用多元素标记化策略（特征、类型、跳数距离、时间和局部结构），结合局部子图采样和全局可学习质心注意力机制。

Result: 在RelBench基准的21个任务中，RelGT性能优于GNN基线高达18%。

Conclusion: RelGT证明了图变换器在关系深度学习中的潜力，为复杂关系数据建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building
state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by
representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph
Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex
structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational
data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on
general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique
challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive,
heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal
dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization
schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational
Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed
specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element
tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features,
type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of
heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our
architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global
attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide
representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT
consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing
Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时LLM代理训练中信用分配的挑战，同时保持组强化学习的优势。

Method: 提出两层次结构（宏观轨迹组和微观步骤组）估计相对优势，无需额外模型或数据。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop基准上性能提升>12%和>9%，且资源开销不变。

Conclusion: GiGPO有效平衡了信用分配的细粒度和计算效率，适用于复杂代理任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven
frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical
reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training
remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold
over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit
assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this
work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL
algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while
preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory,
and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating
relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative
advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level,
GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively
constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across
trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together,
enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure
effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step
effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We
evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers
fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\%
on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining
the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no
additional time cost.

Conclusion: GenoArmory为GFM安全性提供重要工具，GenoAdv数据集进一步支持研究，任务类型和模型设计显著影响脆弱性。

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic
Foundation Models (GFMs), named GenoArmory. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks,
GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to
systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks.
Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five
state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three
defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and
comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model
architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we
introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM
safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to
adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the
impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks
frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that
these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Motivation: 异构网络的多样性和动态性增加了决策复杂性，传统DRL批评模型的浅层架构难以应对多任务复杂性。

Result: 实验表明ReaCritic在异构网络和标准任务中提升了收敛速度和最终性能。

Conclusion: ReaCritic通过引入推理能力显著提升了DRL在动态环境中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) pose critical challenges for intelligent
management due to the diverse user requirements and time-varying wireless
conditions. These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which
limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods.
In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic
structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by
estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use
shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates,
limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent
progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision
quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a large reasoning
transformer-based criticmodel scaling scheme that brings reasoning ability into
DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs
and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a
broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances
generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance
across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer和LLM方法在时间序列预测中忽视局部动态，仅依赖全局依赖。

Method: Logo-LLM从预训练LLM的不同层提取多尺度特征，并引入Local-Mixer和Global-Mixer模块对齐和整合特征。

Result: 实验表明Logo-LLM在多种基准测试中表现优异，具有强泛化能力和低计算开销。

Conclusion: Logo-LLM通过多尺度特征建模显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical across multiple domains, where time
series data exhibits both local patterns and global dependencies. While
Transformer-based methods effectively capture global dependencies, they often
overlook short-term local variations in time series. Recent methods that adapt
large language models (LLMs) into time series forecasting inherit this
limitation by treating LLMs as black-box encoders, relying solely on the
final-layer output and underutilizing hierarchical representations. To address
this limitation, we propose Logo-LLM, a novel LLM-based framework that
explicitly extracts and models multi-scale temporal features from different
layers of a pre-trained LLM. Through empirical analysis, we show that shallow
layers of LLMs capture local dynamics in time series, while deeper layers
encode global trends. Moreover, Logo-LLM introduces lightweight Local-Mixer and
Global-Mixer modules to align and integrate features with the temporal input
across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Logo-LLM achieves
superior performance across diverse benchmarks, with strong generalization in
few-shot and zero-shot settings while maintaining low computational overhead.

Motivation: 探索背景知识（BK）图在生物医学领域机器学习中的实际贡献，特别是在癌症亚型分类任务中，BK是否真能提升模型性能。

Method: 引入评估框架，包括合成实验（BK明确有用）和BK图扰动模拟，测试BK感知模型在合成和真实生物医学数据中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BK在GNN中的应用需谨慎设计，其与模型架构的匹配是关键，未来研究应关注如何优化这种匹配以实现性能提升。

Abstract: In complex and low-data domains such as biomedical research, incorporating
background knowledge (BK) graphs, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks, into graph-based machine learning pipelines is a promising research
direction. However, while BK is often assumed to improve model performance, its
actual contribution and the impact of imperfect knowledge remain poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the role of BK in an important
real-world task: cancer subtype classification. Surprisingly, we find that (i)
state-of-the-art GNNs using BK perform no better than uninformed models like
linear regression, and (ii) their performance remains largely unchanged even
when the BK graph is heavily perturbed. To understand these unexpected results,
we introduce an evaluation framework, which employs (i) a synthetic setting
where the BK is clearly informative and (ii) a set of perturbations that
simulate various imperfections in BK graphs. With this, we test the robustness
of BK-aware models in both synthetic and real-world biomedical settings. Our
findings reveal that careful alignment of GNN architectures and BK
characteristics is necessary but holds the potential for significant
performance improvements.

Abstract: The implementation of thermally sprayed components in steel manufacturing
presents challenges for production and plant maintenance. While enhancing
performance through specialized surface properties, these components may
encounter difficulties in meeting modified requirements due to standardization
in the refurbishment process. This article proposes updating the established
coating process for thermally spray coated components for steel manufacturing
(TCCSM) by integrating real-time data analytics and predictive quality
management. Two essential components--the data aggregator and the quality
predictor--are designed through continuous process monitoring and the
application of data-driven methodologies to meet the dynamic demands of the
evolving steel landscape. The quality predictor is powered by the simple and
effective multiple kernel learning strategy with the goal of realizing
predictive quality. The data aggregator, designed with sensors, flow meters,
and intelligent data processing for the thermal spray coating process, is
proposed to facilitate real-time analytics. The performance of this combination
was verified using small-scale tests that enabled not only the accurate
prediction of coating quality based on the collected data but also proactive
notification to the operator as soon as significant deviations are identified.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) as foundation models have significantly
enhanced performance across a wide range of visual and textual tasks, without
requiring large-scale training from scratch for downstream tasks. However,
these deterministic VLMs fail to capture the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty
in natural language and visual data. Recent probabilistic post-hoc adaptation
methods address this by mapping deterministic embeddings onto probability
distributions; however, existing approaches do not account for the asymmetric
uncertainty structure of the modalities, and the constraint that meaningful
deterministic embeddings reside on a unit hypersphere, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the asymmetric uncertainty
structure inherent in textual and visual data, and propose AsymVLM to build

*Kihun Hong,Sejun Park,Ganguk Hwang*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一框架，用于解决垂直联邦学习中的数据对齐、未标记数据和多机构协作问题，实验表明其性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有垂直联邦学习方法对数据对齐、参与方数量和数据标记有严格限制，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将数据对齐问题重新解释为缺失数据问题，提出了一种支持任意对齐和标记场景的统一框架。

Result: 在168种实验配置中，该方法在160种情况下优于基线，平均领先9.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 这是首个同时处理任意数据对齐、未标记数据和多机构协作的垂直联邦学习框架。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has attracted significant attention for enabling
collaborative learning without exposing private data. Among the primary
variants of FL, vertical federated learning (VFL) addresses feature-partitioned
data held by multiple institutions, each holding complementary information for
the same set of users. However, existing VFL methods often impose restrictive
assumptions such as a small number of participating parties, fully aligned
data, or only using labeled data. In this work, we reinterpret alignment gaps
in VFL as missing data problems and propose a unified framework that
accommodates both training and inference under arbitrary alignment and labeling
scenarios, while supporting diverse missingness mechanisms. In the experiments
on 168 configurations spanning four benchmark datasets, six training-time
missingness patterns, and seven testing-time missingness patterns, our method
outperforms all baselines in 160 cases with an average gap of 9.6 percentage
points over the next-best competitors. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first VFL framework to jointly handle arbitrary data alignment, unlabeled
data, and multi-party collaboration all at once.

*Zhexiang Li,Haoyu Wang,Yutong Bao,David Woodruff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种预评分机制，通过K-means聚类、K-median聚类和杠杆评分排序改进HyperAttention，显著降低了困惑度并提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HyperAttention的均匀残差采样限制了关键键的捕获，导致困惑度上升。

Method: 引入三种预评分方法（K-means、K-median、杠杆评分）替代均匀残差采样，优化键的优先级。

Result: 在ChatGLM2上困惑度从12降至8.3，速度比FlashAttention快20倍，ViT上表现与LevAttention相当或更优。

Conclusion: 预评分机制显著提升了Transformer的效率和建模准确性，实现了速度与精度的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures deeply enhance long-context
language modeling. Among them, HyperAttention achieves competitive efficiency
by combining a single-level LSH-based clustering with uniform residual
sampling. However,such a sampling limits crucial keys' capturing, which in turn
raises the overall perplexity. In this paper, we propose a pre-scoring
mechanism to assist HyperAttention to prioritize significant keys.
Specifically, we introduce three scoring methods: K-means clustering, K-median
clustering, and leverage score-based ranking (inspired by LevAttention) to
filter keys effectively. We further replace HyperAttention's original uniform
residual sampling entirely, relying exclusively on our pre-scoring mechanism.
Experiments on ChatGLM2 (131k token context) reduce perplexity from 12 to 8.3,
which outperforms standard HyperAttention. Moreover, when running on the
Vision-Transformer (ViT), our method shows that it can guarantee similar
accuracy compared with LevAttention, and will surpass LevAttention given
specific parameters. Although this method introduces computational overhead,
its combination with HyperAttention remains 20 times faster than
FlashAttention, providing a balanced trade-off between speed and modeling
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating pre-scoring
into hierarchical attention mechanisms, significantly improving Transformer's
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为随机分布蒸馏（RDD）的新方法，通过将目标网络的输出建模为正态分布样本，结合伪计数和差异项，统一了基于计数和预测误差的探索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习中，探索是一个关键挑战，现有方法（如基于计数和预测误差的方法）各有局限性，需要一种更有效的统一方法。

Method: RDD方法通过采样目标网络的输出为正态分布样本，将预测网络与目标网络的差异作为内在奖励，结合伪计数和差异项实现探索。

Result: 实验表明，RDD在高维空间中保留了预测误差方法的优势，同时实现了类似伪计数的奖励衰减模式，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RDD有效统一了两种探索方法，提升了在线强化学习的探索能力。

Abstract: Exploration remains a critical challenge in online reinforcement learning, as
an agent must effectively explore unknown environments to achieve high returns.
Currently, the main exploration algorithms are primarily count-based methods
and curiosity-based methods, with prediction-error methods being a prominent
example. In this paper, we propose a novel method called \textbf{R}andom
\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{D}istillation (RDD), which samples the output of
a target network from a normal distribution. RDD facilitates a more extensive
exploration by explicitly treating the difference between the prediction
network and the target network as an intrinsic reward. Furthermore, by
introducing randomness into the output of the target network for a given state
and modeling it as a sample from a normal distribution, intrinsic rewards are
bounded by two key components: a pseudo-count term ensuring proper exploration
decay and a discrepancy term accounting for predictor convergence. We
demonstrate that RDD effectively unifies both count-based and prediction-error
approaches. It retains the advantages of prediction-error methods in
high-dimensional spaces, while also implementing an intrinsic reward decay mode
akin to the pseudo-count method. In the experimental section, RDD is compared
with more advanced methods in a series of environments. Both theoretical
analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in
improving online exploration for reinforcement learning tasks.

Result: 证明停止机制能表达分级模态μ-演算中的节点分类器，并实现新的模型检查算法。

Conclusion: 停止机制和计数算法为循环GNN提供了更强的表达能力和实用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of machine-learning models that
operate on graph-structured data. Their expressive power is intimately related
to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for
recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or
suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a
halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can
express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for
the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. A recent
breakthrough in the study of the expressivity of graded modal mu-calculus in
the finite suggests that conversely, restricted to node classifiers definable
in monadic second-order logic, recurrent GNNs can express only node classifiers
definable in graded modal mu-calculus. To prove our main result, we develop a
new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of
independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking
algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size.
In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a
halting recurrent GNN.

Motivation: 解决现有深度生存模型在数据稀缺情况下校准性不足的问题，提供更稳健的不确定性估计。

Method: 提出非参数、架构无关的框架，采用两阶段数据增强方案，并设计均值场变分算法进行高效后验推断。

Result: 在合成基准和真实数据集上，NeuralSurv在保持或超越判别性能的同时，校准性优于现有深度生存模型。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在数据稀缺情况下显著提升模型校准性和不确定性估计的稳健性。

Abstract: We introduce NeuralSurv, the first deep survival model to incorporate
Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our non-parametric, architecture-agnostic
framework flexibly captures time-varying covariate-risk relationships in
continuous time via a novel two-stage data-augmentation scheme, for which we
establish theoretical guarantees. For efficient posterior inference, we
introduce a mean-field variational algorithm with coordinate-ascent updates
that scale linearly in model size. By locally linearizing the Bayesian neural
network, we obtain full conjugacy and derive all coordinate updates in closed
form. In experiments, NeuralSurv delivers superior calibration compared to
state-of-the-art deep survival models, while matching or exceeding their
discriminative performance across both synthetic benchmarks and real-world
datasets. Our results demonstrate the value of Bayesian principles in
data-scarce regimes by enhancing model calibration and providing robust,
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the survival function.

Motivation: 模拟内存计算在深度学习训练和迁移学习中具有潜力，但现有算法因设备非线性和不对称性而效果不佳。

Result: 评估了c-TTv2算法的性能，并研究了其对设备规格变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: c-TTv2算法在模拟内存计算中表现出潜力，但仍需进一步验证其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing is a next-generation computing paradigm that
promises fast, parallel, and energy-efficient deep learning training and
transfer learning (TL). However, achieving this promise has remained elusive
due to a lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit
asymmetric and non-linear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device
variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training
algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Also, recently introduced
algorithms have enjoyed limited attention, as they require bi-directionally
switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly
sensitive. A new algorithm chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which
leverages the chopped technique to address many of the challenges mentioned
above. In this paper, we assess the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for
analog TL using a Swin-ViT model on a subset of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also
investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device
specifications, including weight transfer noise, symmetry point skew, and
symmetry point variability

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Double Binary Factorization（DBF）的新方法，通过将稠密权重矩阵分解为两个二进制矩阵和缩放向量的乘积，保留了二进制表示的高效性，同时在1-bit和2-bit量化范围内表现优于或与现有方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算和存储需求增加的问题，同时避免二进制量化（±1）导致的显著精度下降。

Method: 提出DBF方法，将权重矩阵分解为两个二进制矩阵和缩放向量的乘积，并通过调整分解的中间维度实现细粒度的压缩比控制。

Result: 在1-bit量化范围内优于现有二值化方法，在2-bit范围内与QuIP#和QTIP等最佳量化方法竞争。

Conclusion: DBF不仅高效且灵活，还能通过非均匀层间压缩比算法进一步优化压缩效果。

Abstract: Binary quantization approaches, which replace weight matrices with binary
matrices and substitute costly multiplications with cheaper additions, offer a
computationally efficient approach to address the increasing computational and
storage requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the severe
quantization constraint ($\pm1$) can lead to significant accuracy degradation.
In this paper, we propose Double Binary Factorization (DBF), a novel method
that factorizes dense weight matrices into products of two binary (sign)
matrices, each accompanied by scaling vectors. DBF preserves the efficiency
advantages of binary representations while achieving compression rates that are
competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in a
1-bit per weight range, DBF is better than existing binarization approaches. In
a 2-bit per weight range, DBF is competitive with the best quantization methods
like QuIP\# and QTIP. Unlike most existing compression techniques, which offer
limited compression level choices, DBF allows fine-grained control over
compression ratios by adjusting the factorization's intermediate dimension.
Based on this advantage, we further introduce an algorithm for estimating
non-uniform layer-wise compression ratios for DBF, based on previously
developed channel pruning criteria.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Q学习的损失函数ShiQ，用于优化预训练大语言模型（LLM），解决了传统Q学习在LLM中直接应用无效的问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法（如直接策略优化）在LLM中占主导，而Q学习方法因其样本效率和离线学习能力在非LLM任务中表现优异，但直接应用于LLM无效。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过从Bellman方程推导理论基础的损失函数，将Q学习方法适配到LLM，并提出算法ShiQ，支持离策略、逐标记学习。

Result: 在合成数据和真实基准（如UltraFeedback和BFCL-V3）上验证了ShiQ在单轮和多轮LLM任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: ShiQ为LLM提供了一种高效、实用的Q学习方法，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: The fine-tuning of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using
reinforcement learning (RL) is generally formulated as direct policy
optimization. This approach was naturally favored as it efficiently improves a
pretrained LLM, seen as an initial policy. Another RL paradigm, Q-learning
methods, has received far less attention in the LLM community while
demonstrating major success in various non-LLM RL tasks. In particular,
Q-learning effectiveness comes from its sample efficiency and ability to learn
offline, which is particularly valuable given the high computational cost of
sampling with LLMs. However, naively applying a Q-learning-style update to the
model's logits is ineffective due to the specificity of LLMs. Our core
contribution is to derive theoretically grounded loss functions from Bellman
equations to adapt Q-learning methods to LLMs. To do so, we carefully adapt
insights from the RL literature to account for LLM-specific characteristics,
ensuring that the logits become reliable Q-value estimates. We then use this
loss to build a practical algorithm, ShiQ for Shifted-Q, that supports
off-policy, token-wise learning while remaining simple to implement. Finally,
we evaluate ShiQ on both synthetic data and real-world benchmarks, e.g.,
UltraFeedback and BFCL-V3, demonstrating its effectiveness in both single-turn
and multi-turn LLM settings

Motivation: 现实工业场景中，多模式过程的健康状态类别通常仅部分重叠，现有方法难以应对数据不完整和分布差异的挑战。

Method: 通过健康类别数据构建模式间映射生成多模式样本，利用插值丰富故障数据多样性，结合自适应实例归一化和时空注意力机制提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，TSA-SAN显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSA-SAN通过自适应和注意力机制有效提升了多模式故障诊断的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have shown promising performance in fault diagnosis for
multimode process. Most existing studies assume that the collected health state
categories from different operating modes are identical. However, in real
industrial scenarios, these categories typically exhibit only partial overlap.
The incompleteness of the available data and the large distributional
differences between the operating modes pose a significant challenge to
existing fault diagnosis methods. To address this problem, a novel fault
diagnosis model named self-adaptive temporal-spatial attention network
(TSA-SAN) is proposed. First, inter-mode mappings are constructed using healthy
category data to generate multimode samples. To enrich the diversity of the
fault data, interpolation is performed between healthy and fault samples.
Subsequently, the fault diagnosis model is trained using real and generated
data. The self-adaptive instance normalization is established to suppress
irrelevant information while retaining essential statistical features for
diagnosis. In addition, a temporal-spatial attention mechanism is constructed
to focus on the key features, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the
model. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be
available on Github at https://github.com/GuangqiangLi/TSA-SAN.

Motivation: KCI测试在因果发现中表现优异，但计算复杂度高，难以应用于大规模数据集。FastKCI旨在解决这一计算瓶颈。

Method: 采用混合专家方法，基于高斯混合模型对条件变量进行分区，并行执行局部KCI测试，并通过重要性加权采样汇总结果。

Result: 实验表明，FastKCI在保持原始KCI统计性能的同时，显著提升了计算速度。

Conclusion: FastKCI为大规模数据中的条件独立性测试提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) testing is a powerful
nonparametric method commonly employed in causal discovery tasks. Despite its
flexibility and statistical reliability, cubic computational complexity limits
its application to large datasets. To address this computational bottleneck, we
propose \textit{FastKCI}, a scalable and parallelizable kernel-based
conditional independence test that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach
inspired by embarrassingly parallel inference techniques for Gaussian
processes. By partitioning the dataset based on a Gaussian mixture model over
the conditioning variables, FastKCI conducts local KCI tests in parallel,
aggregating the results using an importance-weighted sampling scheme.
Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks on real-world production data
validate that FastKCI maintains the statistical power of the original KCI test
while achieving substantial computational speedups. FastKCI thus represents a
practical and efficient solution for conditional independence testing in causal
inference on large-scale data.

Result: BiDist在合作、竞争和社会困境任务中表现出卓越的泛化能力，显著扩展了策略分布空间。

Conclusion: BiDist是一种简洁高效的解决方案，无需复杂存储，理论和实验均验证其有效性。

Abstract: Population-population generalization is a challenging problem in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly when agents encounter unseen
co-players. However, existing self-play-based methods are constrained by the
limitation of inside-space generalization. In this study, we propose
Bidirectional Distillation (BiDist), a novel mixed-play framework, to overcome
this limitation in MARL. BiDist leverages knowledge distillation in two
alternating directions: forward distillation, which emulates the historical
policies' space and creates an implicit self-play, and reverse distillation,
which systematically drives agents towards novel distributions outside the
known policy space in a non-self-play manner. In addition, BiDist operates as a
concise and efficient solution without the need for the complex and costly
storage of past policies. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical
evidence to support BiDist's effectiveness. Our results highlight its
remarkable generalization ability across a variety of cooperative, competitive,
and social dilemma tasks, and reveal that BiDist significantly diversifies the
policy distribution space. We also present comprehensive ablation studies to
reinforce BiDist's effectiveness and key success factors. Source codes are
available in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Finding the most similar subsequences between two multidimensional time
series has many applications: e.g. capturing dependency in stock market or
discovering coordinated movement of baboons. Considering one pattern occurring
in one time series, we might be wondering whether the same pattern occurs in
another time series with some distortion that might have a different length.
Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient framework
that deals with this problem yet. In this work, we propose an algorithm that
provides the exact solution of finding the most similar multidimensional
subsequences between time series where there is a difference in length both
between time series and between subsequences. The algorithm is built based on
theoretical guarantee of correctness and efficiency. The result in simulation
datasets illustrated that our approach not just only provided correct solution,
but it also utilized running time only quarter of time compared against the
baseline approaches. In real-world datasets, it extracted the most similar
subsequences even faster (up to 20 times faster against baseline methods) and
provided insights regarding the situation in stock market and following
relations of multidimensional time series of baboon movement. Our approach can
be used for any time series. The code and datasets of this work are provided

Result: 实验表明DB-PINN在收敛速度和预测精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DB-PINN有效解决了PINNs中的不平衡问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a new learning
paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing the
constraints of physical equations, boundary conditions (BCs), and initial
conditions (ICs) into the loss function. Despite their successes, vanilla PINNs
still suffer from poor accuracy and slow convergence due to the intractable
multi-objective optimization issue. In this paper, we propose a novel
Dual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN), which dynamically adjusts loss weights by
integrating inter-balancing and intra-balancing to alleviate two imbalance
issues in PINNs. Inter-balancing aims to mitigate the gradient imbalance
between PDE residual loss and condition-fitting losses by determining an
aggregated weight that offsets their gradient distribution discrepancies.
Intra-balancing acts on condition-fitting losses to tackle the imbalance in
fitting difficulty across diverse conditions. By evaluating the fitting
difficulty based on the loss records, intra-balancing can allocate the
aggregated weight proportionally to each condition loss according to its
fitting difficulty levels. We further introduce a robust weight update strategy
to prevent abrupt spikes and arithmetic overflow in instantaneous weight values
caused by large loss variances, enabling smooth weight updating and stable
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DB-PINN achieves significantly
superior performance than those popular gradient-based weighting methods in
terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. Our code and supplementary
material are available at https://github.com/chenhong-zhou/DualBalanced-PINNs.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various

To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{GraphOracle}}, a
relation-centric foundation model that unifies reasoning across knowledge
graphs by converting them into Relation-Dependency Graphs (RDG), explicitly
encoding compositional patterns with fewer edges than prior methods. A
query-dependent attention mechanism is further developed to learn inductive
representations for both relations and entities. Pre-training on diverse
knowledge graphs, followed by minutes-level fine-tuning, enables effective
generalization to unseen entities, relations, and entire graphs. Through
comprehensive experiments on 31 diverse benchmarks spanning transductive,
inductive, and cross-domain settings, we demonstrate consistent
state-of-the-art performance with minimal adaptation, improving the prediction
performance by up to 35\% compared to the strongest baselines.

Result: 理论证明双自适应步长规则是最小极大最优的，实验显示优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FedDuA无需额外通信或计算成本，性能优越且对超参数鲁棒。

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed learning framework where clients
collaboratively train a global model without sharing their raw data. FedAvg is
a popular algorithm for federated learning, but it often suffers from slow
convergence due to the heterogeneity of local datasets and anisotropy in the
parameter space. In this work, we formalize the central server optimization
procedure through the lens of mirror descent and propose a novel framework,
called FedDuA, which adaptively selects the global learning rate based on both
inter-client and coordinate-wise heterogeneity in the local updates. We prove
that our proposed doubly adaptive step-size rule is minimax optimal and provide
a convergence analysis for convex objectives. Although the proposed method does
not require additional communication or computational cost on clients,
extensive numerical experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms
baselines in various settings and is robust to the choice of hyperparameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable
ability to capture complex image distributions, but the geometric properties of
the learned data manifold remain poorly understood. We address this gap by
introducing a score-based Riemannian metric that leverages the Stein score
function from diffusion models to characterize the intrinsic geometry of the
data manifold without requiring explicit parameterization. Our approach defines
a metric tensor in the ambient space that stretches distances perpendicular to
the manifold while preserving them along tangential directions, effectively
creating a geometry where geodesics naturally follow the manifold's contours.
We develop efficient algorithms for computing these geodesics and demonstrate
their utility for both interpolation between data points and extrapolation
beyond the observed data distribution. Through experiments on synthetic data
with known geometry, Rotated MNIST, and complex natural images via Stable
Diffusion, we show that our score-based geodesics capture meaningful
transformations that respect the underlying data distribution. Our method
consistently outperforms baseline approaches on perceptual metrics (LPIPS) and
distribution-level metrics (FID, KID), producing smoother, more realistic image
transitions. These results reveal the implicit geometric structure learned by
diffusion models and provide a principled way to navigate the manifold of
natural images through the lens of Riemannian geometry.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种公平性感知的无监督异常检测方法FairAD，通过将不同人口统计组的数据映射到共同目标分布，确保公平性，并提出了无阈值公平性指标。

Motivation: 在金融、医疗等高社会影响领域，无监督异常检测可能因数据偏见导致不公平，需解决组间公平性问题。

Result: 实验表明，FairAD在准确性和公平性之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于平衡和倾斜数据。

Conclusion: FairAD为无监督异常检测中的公平性问题提供了有效解决方案，并通过无阈值指标简化了公平性评估。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is a critical task in many high-social-impact
applications such as finance, healthcare, social media, and cybersecurity,
where demographics involving age, gender, race, disease, etc, are used
frequently. In these scenarios, possible bias from anomaly detection systems
can lead to unfair treatment for different groups and even exacerbate social
bias. In this work, first, we thoroughly analyze the feasibility and necessary
assumptions for ensuring group fairness in unsupervised anomaly detection.
Second, we propose a novel fairness-aware anomaly detection method FairAD. From
the normal training data, FairAD learns a projection to map data of different
demographic groups to a common target distribution that is simple and compact,
and hence provides a reliable base to estimate the density of the data. The
density can be directly used to identify anomalies while the common target
distribution ensures fairness between different groups. Furthermore, we propose
a threshold-free fairness metric that provides a global view for model's
fairness, eliminating dependence on manual threshold selection. Experiments on
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an improved
trade-off between detection accuracy and fairness under both balanced and
skewed data across different groups.

*Desong Zhang,Jia Hu,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNNs trained with direct encoding and BPTT are vulnerable to catastrophic collapse from heterogeneous data. DEP method mitigates this by reducing Hessian spectral radius.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerability of SNNs trained with direct encoding and BPTT to heterogeneous data, which causes catastrophic collapse.

Method: Developed Dominant Eigencomponent Projection (DEP), a hyperparameter-free method that orthogonally projects gradients to remove dominant components and reduce Hessian spectral radius.

Result: DEP effectively mitigates vulnerability to heterogeneous data poisoning and enhances SNN robustness compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DEP provides a safer and more reliable solution for SNN deployment by addressing the vulnerability issue.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) process information via discrete spikes,
enabling them to operate at remarkably low energy levels. However, our
experimental observations reveal a striking vulnerability when SNNs are trained
using the mainstream method--direct encoding combined with backpropagation
through time (BPTT): even a single backward pass on data drawn from a slightly
different distribution can lead to catastrophic network collapse. Our
theoretical analysis attributes this vulnerability to the repeated inputs
inherent in direct encoding and the gradient accumulation characteristic of
BPTT, which together produce an exceptional large Hessian spectral radius. To
address this challenge, we develop a hyperparameter-free method called Dominant
Eigencomponent Projection (DEP). By orthogonally projecting gradients to
precisely remove their dominant components, DEP effectively reduces the Hessian
spectral radius, thereby preventing SNNs from settling into sharp minima.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DEP not only mitigates the vulnerability
of SNNs to heterogeneous data poisoning, but also significantly enhances
overall robustness compared to key baselines, providing strong support for
safer and more reliable SNN deployment.

Motivation: 解决图神经网络中缺乏共识的图结构选择问题，并提升Covariance Neural Networks（VNN）的性能。

Method: 构建密度矩阵，将样本协方差矩阵作为准哈密顿量，用作图移位算子（GSO），以提取数据的不同尺度特征。

Conclusion: 密度矩阵方法为脑机接口的迁移学习提供了有效基础，尤其在处理未见个体数据时表现突出。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network
data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph
structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address
this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator
(GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density
Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of
the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density
matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different
scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this
approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of
the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and
outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying
covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can
achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG
motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This
shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the
notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen
individuals.

*Ashok Arora,Neetesh Kumar*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型双向循环模型架构，用于提升部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）中的样本效率和减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观测的强化学习场景中，传统方法如循环网络和基于Transformer的模型存在参数过多或性能不足的问题。

Method: 采用双向循环单元替代多层前馈层，以更好地捕捉和利用序列依赖性和上下文信息。

Result: 在23个POMDP环境中，新模型平均性能优于现有方法87.39%至482.04%。

Conclusion: 该架构显著提升了样本效率和模型性能，适用于部分可观测环境。

Abstract: In real-world reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios, agents often encounter
partial observability, where incomplete or noisy information obscures the true
state of the environment. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs) are commonly used to model these environments, but effective
performance requires memory mechanisms to utilise past observations. While
recurrence networks have traditionally addressed this need, transformer-based
models have recently shown improved sample efficiency in RL tasks. However,
their application to POMDPs remains underdeveloped, and their real-world
deployment is constrained due to the high parameter count. This work introduces
a novel bi-recurrent model architecture that improves sample efficiency and
reduces model parameter count in POMDP scenarios. The architecture replaces the
multiple feed forward layers with a single layer of bi-directional recurrence
unit to better capture and utilize sequential dependencies and contextual
information. This approach improves the model's ability to handle partial
observability and increases sample efficiency, enabling effective learning from
comparatively fewer interactions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
model architecture, experiments were conducted on a total of 23 POMDP
environments. The proposed model architecture outperforms existing
transformer-based, attention-based, and recurrence-based methods by a margin
ranging from 87.39% to 482.04% on average across the 23 POMDP environments.

Conclusion: 球面几何先验在球面域学习中具有显著优势，提出的方法在性能和可扩展性上均表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce a generalized attention mechanism for spherical domains,
enabling Transformer architectures to natively process data defined on the
two-dimensional sphere - a critical need in fields such as atmospheric physics,
cosmology, and robotics, where preserving spherical symmetries and topology is
essential for physical accuracy. By integrating numerical quadrature weights
into the attention mechanism, we obtain a geometrically faithful spherical
attention that is approximately rotationally equivariant, providing strong
inductive biases and leading to better performance than Cartesian approaches.
To further enhance both scalability and model performance, we propose
neighborhood attention on the sphere, which confines interactions to geodesic
neighborhoods. This approach reduces computational complexity and introduces
the additional inductive bias for locality, while retaining the symmetry
properties of our method. We provide optimized CUDA kernels and
memory-efficient implementations to ensure practical applicability. The method
is validated on three diverse tasks: simulating shallow water equations on the
rotating sphere, spherical image segmentation, and spherical depth estimation.
Across all tasks, our spherical Transformers consistently outperform their
planar counterparts, highlighting the advantage of geometric priors for
learning on spherical domains.

Result: EVA在DVS128-Gesture和N-Cars识别任务中表现优于现有方法，并在Gen1检测任务中达到47.7 mAP。

Conclusion: EVA为实时事件视觉应用提供了突破性解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras deliver visual data with high temporal resolution, low latency,
and minimal redundancy, yet their asynchronous, sparse sequential nature
challenges standard tensor-based machine learning (ML). While the recent
asynchronous-to-synchronous (A2S) paradigm aims to bridge this gap by
asynchronously encoding events into learned representations for ML pipelines,
existing A2S approaches often sacrifice representation expressivity and
generalizability compared to dense, synchronous methods. This paper introduces
EVA (EVent Asynchronous representation learning), a novel A2S framework to
generate highly expressive and generalizable event-by-event representations.
Inspired by the analogy between events and language, EVA uniquely adapts
advances from language modeling in linear attention and self-supervised
learning for its construction. In demonstration, EVA outperforms prior A2S
methods on recognition tasks (DVS128-Gesture and N-Cars), and represents the
first A2S framework to successfully master demanding detection tasks, achieving
a remarkable 47.7 mAP on the Gen1 dataset. These results underscore EVA's
transformative potential for advancing real-time event-based vision
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种伪量化训练（PQT）方法，通过高斯权重采样解决了全量化训练（FQT）的稳定性问题，并在低精度浮点参数下实现了高效和稳定的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全量化训练（FQT）虽然能加速训练，但面临一致性和稳定性挑战，需要大量数据支持。伪量化训练（PQT）尚未被充分研究，但有望解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种浮点友好的噪声分布$R$，支持随机精度退火，并通过高效的伪量化（加法后浮点转换）实现低精度浮点参数训练。

Result: 高斯权重采样具有可扩展性（支持低至FP6的精度）、高效性（计算开销低至1.40%）和稳定性（性能接近或超过BF16基线）。

Conclusion: PQT方法为低精度浮点参数训练提供了有效的理论基础，并在实际训练中表现出高效和稳定的性能。

Abstract: Ever-growing scale of large language models (LLMs) is pushing for improved
efficiency, favoring fully quantized training (FQT) over BF16. While FQT
accelerates training, it faces consistency challenges and requires searching
over an exponential number of cases, each needing over 200B tokens to ensure
stability.
  Pseudo-quantization training (PQT) addresses the issues of FQT, although it
is not well-studied. We explore the practical implications of PQT in detail and
propose a noise distribution $R$ that is floating-point (FP)-friendly, with
ideal properties including stochastic precision annealing. As a result, the
proposed method serves as an effective theoretical foundation for low-precision
FP parameters through PQT, utilizing efficient fake quantization via an
addition and subsequent FP casting.
  We demonstrate that Gaussian weight sampling is (1) scalable: supports
low-precision FP parameters down to FP6 and high-precision noise up to 9-bit
with BF16 operator. The proposed method is (2) efficient: incurring
computational overhead as low as 1.40\% on the A100 GPU in terms of Llama2
training tokens per second, and requiring 2 bytes per parameter in GPU memory.
We demonstrate that PQT with Gaussian weight sampling is (3) stable: closely
following or even surpassing performance of the BF16 baseline while
pre-training GPT2 and Llama2 models with up to 1B parameters and 300B tokens.

Abstract: The intrinsic complexity of human biology presents ongoing challenges to
scientific understanding. Researchers collaborate across disciplines to expand
our knowledge of the biological interactions that define human life. AI
methodologies have emerged as powerful tools across scientific domains,
particularly in computational biology, where graph data structures effectively
model biological entities such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
and gene functional networks. Those networks are used as datasets for paramount
network medicine tasks, such as gene-disease association prediction, drug
repurposing, and polypharmacy side effect studies. Reliable predictions from
machine learning models require high-quality foundational data. In this work,
we present a comprehensive multi-purpose biological knowledge graph constructed
by integrating and refining multiple publicly available datasets. Building upon
the Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG), we define a pipeline tasked with
a) cleaning inconsistencies and redundancies present in DRKG, b) coalescing
information from the main available public data sources, and c) enriching the
graph nodes with expressive feature vectors such as molecular fingerprints and
gene ontologies. Biologically and chemically relevant features improve the
capacity of machine learning models to generate accurate and well-structured
embedding spaces. The resulting resource represents a coherent and reliable
biological knowledge graph that serves as a state-of-the-art platform to
advance research in computational biology and precision medicine. Moreover, it
offers the opportunity to benchmark graph-based machine learning and network
medicine models on relevant tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed dataset by benchmarking it against the task of drug repurposing, PPI
prediction, and side-effect prediction, modeled as link prediction problems.

Motivation: 现有方法在从快照数据推断随机、不平衡动力学时，无法充分模拟细胞间交互，而细胞间通信是生命过程的基础，会影响细胞状态转换动力学。

Result: 在合成基因调控数据和真实scRNA-seq数据集上验证了方法的有效性，CytoBridge能更准确地识别生长、转换和交互模式，消除虚假转换，并重构发育景观。

Conclusion: UMFSB和CytoBridge为从稀疏时间分辨数据中建模细胞动力学提供了更灵活的解决方案，尤其在模拟细胞间交互方面表现优异。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics from sparsely time-resolved snapshot data is crucial
for understanding complex cellular processes and behavior. Existing methods
leverage optimal transport, Schr\"odinger bridge theory, or their variants to
simultaneously infer stochastic, unbalanced dynamics from snapshot data.
However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to account for
cell-cell interactions. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios
since intercellular communications are fundamental life processes and can
influence cell state-transition dynamics. To address this challenge, we
formulate the Unbalanced Mean-Field Schr\"odinger Bridge (UMFSB) framework to
model unbalanced stochastic interaction dynamics from snapshot data. Inspired
by this framework, we further propose CytoBridge, a deep learning algorithm
designed to approximate the UMFSB problem. By explicitly modeling cellular
transitions, proliferation, and interactions through neural networks,
CytoBridge offers the flexibility to learn these processes directly from data.
The effectiveness of our method has been extensively validated using both
synthetic gene regulatory data and real scRNA-seq datasets. Compared to
existing methods, CytoBridge identifies growth, transition, and interaction
patterns, eliminates false transitions, and reconstructs the developmental
landscape with greater accuracy.

Result: 该方法显著减少了干扰，提升了视觉和语言任务的性能，且无需额外内存即可添加新模型。

Conclusion: 随机正交变换是一种数据与模型无关的解决方案，支持高效灵活的多模型服务。

Abstract: From a multi-model compression perspective, model merging enables
memory-efficient serving of multiple models fine-tuned from the same base, but
suffers from degraded performance due to interference among their task-specific
parameter adjustments (i.e., deltas). In this paper, we reformulate model
merging as a compress-and-retrieve scheme, revealing that the task interference
arises from the summation of irrelevant deltas during model retrieval. To
address this issue, we use random orthogonal transformations to decorrelate
these vectors into self-cancellation. We show that this approach drastically
reduces interference, improving performance across both vision and language
tasks. Since these transformations are fully defined by random seeds, adding
new models requires no extra memory. Further, their data- and model-agnostic
nature enables easy addition or removal of models with minimal compute
overhead, supporting efficient and flexible multi-model serving.

Result: 在XAI-TRIS基准测试中，PatternLocal表现优于其他XAI方法，减少了非线性任务中的错误归因。

Conclusion: PatternLocal能有效减少抑制变量的影响，提供更可靠和可操作的模型解释。

Abstract: Suppressor variables can influence model predictions without being dependent
on the target outcome and they pose a significant challenge for Explainable AI
(XAI) methods. These variables may cause false-positive feature attributions,
undermining the utility of explanations. Although effective remedies exist for
linear models, their extension to non-linear models and to instance-based
explanations has remained limited. We introduce PatternLocal, a novel XAI
technique that addresses this gap. PatternLocal begins with a locally linear
surrogate, e.g. LIME, KernelSHAP, or gradient-based methods, and transforms the
resulting discriminative model weights into a generative representation,
thereby suppressing the influence of suppressor variables while preserving
local fidelity. In extensive hyperparameter optimization on the XAI-TRIS
benchmark, PatternLocal consistently outperformed other XAI methods and reduced
false-positive attributions when explaining non-linear tasks, thereby enabling
more reliable and actionable insights.

Abstract: Recent research highlights the potential of multimodal foundation models in
tackling complex decision-making challenges. However, their large parameters
make real-world deployment resource-intensive and often impractical for
constrained systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for
task-specific agents but suffers from high sample complexity, limiting
practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce LVLM to
Policy (LVLM2P), a novel framework that distills knowledge from large
vision-language models (LVLM) into more efficient RL agents. Our approach
leverages the LVLM as a teacher, providing instructional actions based on
trajectories collected by the RL agent, which helps reduce less meaningful
exploration in the early stages of learning, thereby significantly accelerating
the agent's learning progress. Additionally, by leveraging the LVLM to suggest
actions directly from visual observations, we eliminate the need for manual
textual descriptors of the environment, enhancing applicability across diverse
tasks. Experiments show that LVLM2P significantly enhances the sample
efficiency of baseline RL algorithms.

Abstract: The Traffic Assignment Problem is a fundamental, yet computationally
expensive, task in transportation modeling, especially for large-scale
networks. Traditional methods require iterative simulations to reach
equilibrium, making real-time or large-scale scenario analysis challenging. In
this paper, we propose a learning-based approach using Message-Passing Neural
Networks as a metamodel to approximate the equilibrium flow of the Stochastic
User Equilibrium assignment. Our model is designed to mimic the algorithmic
structure used in conventional traffic simulators allowing it to better capture
the underlying process rather than just the data. We benchmark it against other
conventional deep learning techniques and evaluate the model's robustness by
testing its ability to predict traffic flows on input data outside the domain
on which it was trained. This approach offers a promising solution for
accelerating out-of-distribution scenario assessments, reducing computational
costs in large-scale transportation planning, and enabling real-time
decision-making.

Abstract: Driven by the relentless growth in model parameters, which renders full

parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
rapidly adapting large models to a wide range of downstream tasks. Among the
PEFT family, orthogonal fine-tuning and its variants have demonstrated
remarkable performance by preserving hyperspherical energy, which encodes
pairwise angular similarity between neurons. However, these methods are
inherently memory-inefficient due to the need to store intermediate activations
from multiple full-dimensional sparse matrices. To address this limitation, we
propose Memory-efficient Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (MOFT) with principal subspace
adaptation. Specifically, we first establish a theoretical condition under
which orthogonal transformations within a low-rank subspace preserve
hyperspherical energy. Based on this insight, we constrain orthogonal
fine-tuning to the principal subspace defined by the top-r components obtained
through singular value decomposition and impose an additional constraint on the
projection matrix to satisfy the preservation condition. To enhance MOFT's
flexibility across tasks, we relax strict orthogonality by introducing two
learnable scaling vectors. Extensive experiments on 37 diverse tasks and four
models across NLP and CV demonstrate that MOFT consistently outperforms key
baselines while significantly reducing the memory footprint of orthogonal
fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决POI推荐领域对老旧数据集的依赖和缺乏全球多样性数据的问题。

Method: 构建并公开Massive-STEPS数据集，包含12个城市的语义POI元数据，并基于此数据集对多种POI推荐模型进行基准测试。

Result: Massive-STEPS提供了更丰富、更近期的数据，支持监督和零样本方法，促进了可重复研究。

Conclusion: Massive-STEPS为人类移动性和POI推荐研究提供了公平、可重复的数据支持。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility through Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation
is increasingly important for applications such as urban planning, personalized
services, and generative agent simulation. However, progress in this field is
hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from
2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that
reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS
(Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale,
publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and
enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and
culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and
longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a
wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised
and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban
contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and
equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation. The dataset and
benchmarking code are available at:

Conclusion: Set-Sequence模型高效灵活，适用于变长单元预测，代码将开源。

Abstract: In many financial prediction problems, the behavior of individual units (such
as loans, bonds, or stocks) is influenced by observable unit-level factors and
macroeconomic variables, as well as by latent cross-sectional effects.
Traditional approaches attempt to capture these latent effects via handcrafted
summary features. We propose a Set-Sequence model that eliminates the need for
handcrafted features. The Set model first learns a shared cross-sectional
summary at each period. The Sequence model then ingests the summary-augmented
time series for each unit independently to predict its outcome. Both components
are learned jointly over arbitrary sets sampled during training. Our approach
harnesses the set nature of the cross-section and is computationally efficient,
generating set summaries in linear time relative to the number of units. It is
also flexible, allowing the use of existing sequence models and accommodating a
variable number of units at inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
our Set-Sequence model significantly outperforms benchmarks on stock return
prediction and mortgage behavior tasks. Code will be released.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，APN在效率和准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APN为不规则多元时间序列预测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is crucial in
key areas such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy.
However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two
main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in
irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods
are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a
general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we
design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves
adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a
time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular
sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a
channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to
effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's
efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental
results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Result: 在131K RULER基准测试中，性能平均提升36%，恢复88%的二次注意力准确率，同时保持98.5%的稀疏性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了稀疏注意力的性能，同时保持了计算效率，适用于任何稀疏注意力方法。

Abstract: The attention mechanism of a transformer has a quadratic complexity, leading
to high inference costs and latency for long sequences. However, attention
matrices are mostly sparse, which implies that many entries may be omitted from
computation for efficient inference. Sparse attention inference methods aim to
reduce this computational burden; however, they also come with a troublesome
performance degradation. We discover that one reason for this degradation is
that the sparse calculation induces a distributional shift in the attention
outputs. The distributional shift causes decoding-time queries to fail to align
well with the appropriate keys from the prefill stage, leading to a drop in
performance. We propose a simple, novel, and effective procedure for correcting
this distributional shift, bringing the distribution of sparse attention
outputs closer to that of quadratic attention. Our method can be applied on top
of any sparse attention method, and results in an average 36%pt performance
increase, recovering 88% of quadratic attention accuracy on the 131K RULER
benchmark when applied on top of sliding window attention with sink tokens
while only adding a small overhead. Our method can maintain approximately 98.5%
sparsity over full quadratic attention, making our model 32 times faster than
Flash Attention 2 when processing 1M token prefills.

Motivation: 传统低秩张量模型对称处理所有维度，无法有效捕捉时空数据中时间维度的低频稳定性和高频变化特性。

Method: 提出FLoST模型，利用傅里叶变换分解时间维度，低频部分用低秩矩阵表示，高频部分用稀疏性表示。

Result: FLoST在准确性和计算效率上优于现有模型，参数更少，尤其适用于大时间维度数据。

Conclusion: FLoST为时空数据重建提供了更高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor completion is crucial in many scientific domains with missing data
problems. Traditional low-rank tensor models, including CP, Tucker, and
Tensor-Train, exploit low-dimensional structures to recover missing data.
However, these methods often treat all tensor modes symmetrically, failing to
capture the unique spatiotemporal patterns inherent in scientific data, where
the temporal component exhibits both low-frequency stability and high-frequency
variations. To address this, we propose a novel model, \underline{F}ourier
\underline{Lo}w-rank and \underline{S}parse \underline{T}ensor (FLoST), which
decomposes the tensor along the temporal dimension using a Fourier transform.
This approach captures low-frequency components with low-rank matrices and
high-frequency fluctuations with sparsity, resulting in a hybrid structure that
efficiently models both smooth and localized variations. Compared to the
well-known tubal-rank model, which assumes low-rankness across all frequency
components, FLoST requires significantly fewer parameters, making it
computationally more efficient, particularly when the time dimension is large.
Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, we demonstrate that
FLoST outperforms existing tensor completion models in terms of both accuracy
and computational efficiency, offering a more interpretable solution for
spatiotemporal data reconstruction.

Motivation: 标准的多类分类通常使用argmax规则，缺乏灵活性。本文旨在通过几何视角和阈值调整，提升分类网络的预测能力。

Method: 将softmax输出的概率解释改为多维单纯形上的几何解释，引入多维阈值，并定义基于阈值的随机变量的得分导向损失。

Result: 实验表明，多维阈值调整能显著提升多种网络和数据集的性能，得分导向损失与标准损失函数竞争性相当。

Conclusion: 该框架为多类分类提供了灵活的后验优化方法，扩展了二元分类中的优势到多类场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a threshold-based framework for multiclass
classification that generalizes the standard argmax rule. This is done by
replacing the probabilistic interpretation of softmax outputs with a geometric
one on the multidimensional simplex, where the classification depends on a
multidimensional threshold. This change of perspective enables for any trained
classification network an a posteriori optimization of the classification score
by means of threshold tuning, as usually carried out in the binary setting.
This allows a further refinement of the prediction capability of any network.
Moreover, this multidimensional threshold-based setting makes it possible to
define score-oriented losses, which are based on the interpretation of the
threshold as a random variable. Our experiments show that the multidimensional
threshold tuning yields consistent performance improvements across various
networks and datasets, and that the proposed multiclass score-oriented losses
are competitive with standard loss functions, resembling the advantages
observed in the binary case.

Result: SubROC在案例研究和多数据集比较中展示了其识别模型优缺点的能力。

Conclusion: SubROC为识别和解释模型在不同子群体中的表现提供了高效、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly employed in real-world applications
like medicine or economics, thus, potentially affecting large populations.
However, ML models often do not perform homogeneously across such populations
resulting in subgroups of the population (e.g., sex=female AND
marital_status=married) where the model underperforms or, conversely, is
particularly accurate. Identifying and describing such subgroups can support
practical decisions on which subpopulation a model is safe to deploy or where
more training data is required. The potential of identifying and analyzing such
subgroups has been recognized, however, an efficient and coherent framework for
effective search is missing. Consequently, we introduce SubROC, an open-source,
easy-to-use framework based on Exceptional Model Mining for reliably and
efficiently finding strengths and weaknesses of classification models in the
form of interpretable population subgroups. SubROC incorporates common
evaluation measures (ROC and PR AUC), efficient search space pruning for fast
exhaustive subgroup search, control for class imbalance, adjustment for
redundant patterns, and significance testing. We illustrate the practical
benefits of SubROC in case studies as well as in comparative analyses across
multiple datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双向信息流（BIF）的层次高斯过程框架，通过双向信息交换提升样本效率和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统层次高斯过程模型仅单向传递信息，限制了样本效率和收敛速度。

Method: BIF框架在父模型和子模型之间建立双向信息交换，支持在线学习。

Result: BIF在合成和实际神经刺激优化任务中表现优于传统方法，父模型和子模型的R²分数分别提高了85%和5倍。

Conclusion: BIF通过双向信息流显著提升了层次高斯过程模型的性能，适用于具有层次结构的问题。

Abstract: Hierarchical Gaussian Process (H-GP) models divide problems into different
subtasks, allowing for different models to address each part, making them
well-suited for problems with inherent hierarchical structure. However, typical
H-GP models do not fully take advantage of this structure, only sending
information up or down the hierarchy. This one-way coupling limits sample
efficiency and slows convergence. We propose Bidirectional Information Flow
(BIF), an efficient H-GP framework that establishes bidirectional information
exchange between parent and child models in H-GPs for online training. BIF
retains the modular structure of hierarchical models - the parent combines
subtask knowledge from children GPs - while introducing top-down feedback to
continually refine children models during online learning. This mutual exchange
improves sample efficiency, enables robust training, and allows modular reuse
of learned subtask models. BIF outperforms conventional H-GP Bayesian
Optimization methods, achieving up to 85% and 5x higher $R^2$ scores for the
parent and children respectively, on synthetic and real-world neurostimulation
optimization tasks.

Result: 研究发现，表达能力更强的GNNs可能泛化性能更差，除非其增加的复杂性通过更大的训练集或更小的训练与测试图距离来平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为GNNs的表达能力与泛化性能之间的关系提供了理论支持，并通过实证结果验证了这些发现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning on structured
data, yet the relationship between their expressivity and predictive
performance remains unclear. We introduce a family of premetrics that capture
different degrees of structural similarity between graphs and relate these
similarities to generalization, and consequently, the performance of expressive
GNNs. By considering a setting where graph labels are correlated with
structural features, we derive generalization bounds that depend on the
distance between training and test graphs, model complexity, and training set
size. These bounds reveal that more expressive GNNs may generalize worse unless
their increased complexity is balanced by a sufficiently large training set or
reduced distance between training and test graphs. Our findings relate
expressivity and generalization, offering theoretical insights supported by
empirical results.

Result: FedACS在动态异构环境中以$O(1/\sqrt{R})$的速率收敛到正确最优解，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedACS是一种通用且高效的方法，能显著减少通信和计算成本，同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) commonly involves clients with diverse communication
and computational capabilities. Such heterogeneity can significantly distort
the optimization dynamics and lead to objective inconsistency, where the global
model converges to an incorrect stationary point potentially far from the
pursued optimum. Despite its critical impact, the joint effect of communication
and computation heterogeneity has remained largely unexplored, due to the
intrinsic complexity of their interaction. In this paper, we reveal the
fundamentally distinct mechanisms through which heterogeneous communication and
computation drive inconsistency in FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first unified theoretical analysis of general heterogeneous FL, offering a
principled understanding of how these two forms of heterogeneity jointly
distort the optimization trajectory under arbitrary choices of local solvers.
Motivated by these insights, we propose Federated Heterogeneity-Aware Client
Sampling, FedACS, a universal method to eliminate all types of objective
inconsistency. We theoretically prove that FedACS converges to the correct
optimum at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{R})$, even in dynamic heterogeneous
environments. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FedACS
outperforms state-of-the-art and category-specific baselines by 4.3%-36%, while
reducing communication costs by 22%-89% and computation loads by 14%-105%,
respectively.

Conclusion: FALDA通过减少认知不确定性，专注于随机不确定性，实现了高效且准确的时间序列预测。

Abstract: We propose the Fourier Adaptive Lite Diffusion Architecture (FALDA), a novel
probabilistic framework for time series forecasting. First, we introduce the
Diffusion Model for Residual Regression (DMRR) framework, which unifies
diffusion-based probabilistic regression methods. Within this framework, FALDA
leverages Fourier-based decomposition to incorporate a component-specific
architecture, enabling tailored modeling of individual temporal components. A
conditional diffusion model is utilized to estimate the future noise term,
while our proposed lightweight denoiser, DEMA (Decomposition MLP with AdaLN),
conditions on the historical noise term to enhance denoising performance.
Through mathematical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that
FALDA effectively reduces epistemic uncertainty, allowing probabilistic
learning to primarily focus on aleatoric uncertainty. Experiments on six
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that FALDA consistently outperforms existing
probabilistic forecasting approaches across most datasets for long-term time
series forecasting while achieving enhanced computational efficiency without
compromising accuracy. Notably, FALDA also achieves superior overall
performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) point forecasting approaches,
with improvements of up to 9%.

Conclusion: 改进方法有效降低了通信开销并提升了边缘设备学习的可靠性。

Abstract: Diffusion learning is a framework that endows edge devices with advanced
intelligence. By processing and analyzing data locally and allowing each agent
to communicate with its immediate neighbors, diffusion effectively protects the
privacy of edge devices, enables real-time response, and reduces reliance on
central servers. However, traditional diffusion learning relies on
communication at every iteration, leading to communication overhead, especially
with large learning models. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of edge
devices, stemming from power outages or signal loss, poses challenges to
reliable communication between neighboring agents. To mitigate these issues,
this paper investigates an enhanced diffusion learning approach incorporating
local updates and partial agent participation. Local updates will curtail
communication frequency, while partial agent participation will allow for the
inclusion of agents based on their availability. We prove that the resulting
algorithm is stable in the mean-square error sense and provide a tight analysis
of its Mean-Square-Deviation (MSD) performance. Various numerical experiments
are conducted to illustrate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) describe phenomena ranging from
turbulence and epidemics to quantum mechanics and financial markets. Despite
recent advances in computational science, solving such PDEs for real-world
applications remains prohibitively expensive because of the necessity of
resolving a broad range of spatiotemporal scales. In turn, practitioners often
rely on coarse-grained approximations of the original PDEs, trading off
accuracy for reduced computational resources. To mitigate the loss of detail
inherent in such approximations, closure models are employed to represent
unresolved spatiotemporal interactions. We present a framework for developing
closure models for PDEs using synthetic data acquired through the method of
manufactured solutions. These data are used in conjunction with reinforcement
learning to provide closures for coarse-grained PDEs. We illustrate the
efficacy of our method using the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Burgers'
equations and the two-dimensional advection equation. Moreover, we demonstrate
that closure models trained for inhomogeneous PDEs can be effectively
generalized to homogeneous PDEs. The results demonstrate the potential for
developing accurate and computationally efficient closure models for systems
with scarce data.

Conclusion: 通过将架构选择与初始预测统计联系起来，本文为归一化层对早期训练行为的影响提供了理论依据，并为更可控和可解释的网络设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization,
are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve
training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is
well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization
affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open
question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of
normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of
network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these
choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which
can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a
subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces
systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks,
which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices
to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled
understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and
offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.

environments by modelling the temporal features using a nonparametric density
estimation network. The novel framework consists of two components, a Stacked
Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (SREnc-Dec) module that captures temporal features in
a latent space, and a Multi-Receptive-field Wavelet Probabilistic Network
(MRWPN) that creates an ensemble probabilistic model to characterise the latent
space. This formulation extends the standard wavelet probabilistic networks to
wavelet deep probabilistic networks, which can handle higher data
dimensionality. The MRWPN module can adapt to different rates of data variation
in different datasets without imposing strong distribution assumptions,
resulting in a more robust and accurate detection for Time Series Anomaly
Detection (TSAD) tasks in the non-stationary environment. We carry out the
assessment on 45 real-world time series datasets from various domains, verify
the performance of RWPNN in TSAD tasks with several constraints, and show its
ability to provide early warnings for anomalous events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单高效的图校准方法，通过减少最后一层参数的权重衰减来解决GNN的欠自信问题，并通过节点级校准补充类中心级校准。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在基于图的任务中表现优异，但其预测置信度常被错误校准，表现为欠自信，影响决策可靠性。现有方法引入额外组件，未能捕捉模型与置信度的内在关系，导致理论保证有限且计算开销增加。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论框架和实验验证，有效解决了GNN的置信度校准问题，提升了决策可靠性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness on
graph-based tasks. However, their predictive confidence is often miscalibrated,
typically exhibiting under-confidence, which harms the reliability of their
decisions. Existing calibration methods for GNNs normally introduce additional
calibration components, which fail to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the model and the prediction confidence, resulting in limited
theoretical guarantees and increased computational overhead. To address this
issue, we propose a simple yet efficient graph calibration method. We establish
a unified theoretical framework revealing that model confidence is jointly
governed by class-centroid-level and node-level calibration at the final layer.
Based on this insight, we theoretically show that reducing the weight decay of
the final-layer parameters alleviates GNN under-confidence by acting on the
class-centroid level, while node-level calibration acts as a finer-grained
complement to class-centroid level calibration, which encourages each test node
to be closer to its predicted class centroid at the final-layer
representations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迭代求解器耗时较长，优化代理通过机器学习模型快速近似求解参数化优化问题，但需要进一步提升其准确性和可靠性。

Method: 采用Sobolev训练范式，在完全监督和自监督两种设置下，通过引入求解器的方向导数信息来优化代理模型。

Result: 在完全监督设置下，均方误差和约束违规显著减少；在自监督设置下，最优性差距减半。

Conclusion: Sobolev训练为大规模安全关键优化任务提供了快速可靠的代理模型。

Abstract: Optimization proxies - machine learning models trained to approximate the
solution mapping of parametric optimization problems in a single forward pass -
offer dramatic reductions in inference time compared to traditional iterative
solvers. This work investigates the integration of solver sensitivities into
such end to end proxies via a Sobolev training paradigm and does so in two
distinct settings: (i) fully supervised proxies, where exact solver outputs and
sensitivities are available, and (ii) self supervised proxies that rely only on
the objective and constraint structure of the underlying optimization problem.
By augmenting the standard training loss with directional derivative
information extracted from the solver, the proxy aligns both its predicted
solutions and local derivatives with those of the optimizer. Under Lipschitz
continuity assumptions on the true solution mapping, matching first order
sensitivities is shown to yield uniform approximation error proportional to the
training set covering radius. Empirically, different impacts are observed in
each studied setting. On three large Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow
benchmarks, supervised Sobolev training cuts mean squared error by up to 56
percent and the median worst case constraint violation by up to 400 percent
while keeping the optimality gap below 0.22 percent. For a mean variance
portfolio task trained without labeled solutions, self supervised Sobolev
training halves the average optimality gap in the medium risk region (standard
deviation above 10 percent of budget) and matches the baseline elsewhere.
Together, these results highlight Sobolev training whether supervised or self
supervised as a path to fast reliable surrogates for safety critical large
scale optimization workloads.

*Andreas Roth,Thomas Liebig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多输入多输出（MIMO）图卷积的直接近似方法，并引入了局部化MIMO图卷积（LMGC），证明了其在多计算图下的表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络（GNNs）通常在单输入单输出（SISO）情况下近似图卷积，而实际应用多为多输入多输出（MIMO）场景，因此需要直接针对MIMO情况设计近似方法。

Method: 通过卷积定理推导MIMO图卷积，并直接在其上进行近似，提出局部化MIMO图卷积（LMGC），该方法可推广到多种线性消息传递神经网络。

Result: 理论证明LMGC在单计算图下对多重集是单射的，多计算图下表示线性独立。实验验证LMGC能结合多种方法的优势。

Conclusion: LMGC为MIMO图卷积提供了一种有效的局部化近似方法，具有理论保证和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Most graph neural networks (GNNs) utilize approximations of the general graph
convolution derived in the graph Fourier domain. While GNNs are typically
applied in the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) case, the approximations are
performed in the single-input single-output (SISO) case. In this work, we first
derive the MIMO graph convolution through the convolution theorem and
approximate it directly in the MIMO case. We find the key MIMO-specific
property of the graph convolution to be operating on multiple computational
graphs, or equivalently, applying distinct feature transformations for each
pair of nodes. As a localized approximation, we introduce localized MIMO graph
convolutions (LMGCs), which generalize many linear message-passing neural
networks. For almost every choice of edge weights, we prove that LMGCs with a
single computational graph are injective on multisets, and the resulting
representations are linearly independent when more than one computational graph
is used. Our experimental results confirm that an LMGC can combine the benefits
of various methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过显式优化神经切线核（NTK）来提升性能，替代传统的深度神经网络（DNN）训练方法，实验表明该方法优于传统DNN及其诱导的NTK。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN训练通过梯度下降隐式学习NTK，但显式优化NTK可能更有效，挑战DNN在特定场景中的主导地位。

Method: 使用核对齐风险估计器（KARE）显式训练NTK，以最小化泛化误差，而非传统的经验风险最小化。

Result: 实验显示，显式训练的NTK性能优于原始DNN及其诱导的NTK。

Conclusion: 显式训练NTK是一种过参数化特征学习形式，可能在某些场景中超越传统DNN优化。

Abstract: The performance of the data-dependent neural tangent kernel (NTK; Jacot et
al. (2018)) associated with a trained deep neural network (DNN) often matches
or exceeds that of the full network. This implies that DNN training via
gradient descent implicitly performs kernel learning by optimizing the NTK. In
this paper, we propose instead to optimize the NTK explicitly. Rather than
minimizing empirical risk, we train the NTK to minimize its generalization
error using the recently developed Kernel Alignment Risk Estimator (KARE; Jacot
et al. (2020)). Our simulations and real data experiments show that NTKs
trained with KARE consistently match or significantly outperform the original
DNN and the DNN- induced NTK (the after-kernel). These results suggest that
explicitly trained kernels can outperform traditional end-to-end DNN
optimization in certain settings, challenging the conventional dominance of
DNNs. We argue that explicit training of NTK is a form of over-parametrized
feature learning.

Motivation: 研究时间序列基础模型在预测物理系统时的表现，揭示其预测策略的局限性。

Method: 通过对比基础模型与直接上下文复制模型的预测效果，分析其预测策略。

Result: 基础模型的预测效果不如简单的上下文复制模型，且计算成本更高。

Conclusion: 上下文复制是一种简单但难以超越的基线方法，有助于识别更高级的上下文学习策略。

Abstract: Recently-developed time series foundation models for scientific machine
learning exhibit emergent abilities to predict physical systems. These
abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future
states of a system given only a short trajectory as context. Here, we show that
foundation models applied to physical systems can give accurate predictions,
but that they fail to develop meaningful representations of the underlying
physics. Instead, foundation models often forecast by context parroting, a
simple zero-shot forecasting strategy that copies directly from the context. As
a result, a naive direct context parroting model scores higher than
state-of-the-art time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of
dynamical systems, at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a
parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains why
large language models trained on text can be repurposed for time series
forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between
forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the attractor,
providing insight into the previously observed in-context neural scaling laws.
Context parroting thus serves as a simple but tough-to-beat baseline for future
time-series foundation models and can help identify in-context learning
strategies beyond parroting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图对比学习方法依赖随机扰动或局部结构保持，缺乏对全局结构一致性的控制。

Method: FractalGCL采用基于重归一化的数据增强和分形维度感知的对比损失，并通过理论推导降低计算开销。

Result: 实验表明FractalGCL在标准基准和交通网络上表现优异，计算成本降低61%。

Conclusion: FractalGCL通过分形理论提升了图对比学习的性能与效率。

Abstract: While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention
in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies
on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent
positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or
local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural
consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose
Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework that
leverages fractal self-similarity to enforce global topological coherence.
FractalGCL introduces two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation
that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a
fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according
to their fractal dimensions. While combining the two innovations markedly
boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational
overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension
estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension
discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a
centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in
dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training
time by approximately 61%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only
delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms
traditional baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about
remarkably 7%. Codes are available at

Result: 在40个基准数据集上的实验验证了LGBQPC的优越性能。

Conclusion: LGBQPC显著提升了GBDPC在复杂数据结构中的表现。

Abstract: The density peaks clustering (DPC) algorithm has attracted considerable
attention for its ability to detect arbitrarily shaped clusters based on a
simple yet effective assumption. Recent advancements integrating granular-ball
(GB) computing with DPC have led to the GB-based DPC (GBDPC) algorithm, which
improves computational efficiency. However, GBDPC demonstrates limitations when
handling complex clustering tasks, particularly those involving data with
complex manifold structures or non-uniform density distributions. To overcome
these challenges, this paper proposes the local GB quality peaks clustering
(LGBQPC) algorithm, which offers comprehensive improvements to GBDPC in both GB
generation and clustering processes based on the principle of justifiable
granularity (POJG). Firstly, an improved GB generation method, termed GB-POJG+,
is developed, which systematically refines the original GB-POJG in four key
aspects: the objective function, termination criterion for GB division,
definition of abnormal GB, and granularity level adaptation strategy. GB-POJG+
simplifies parameter configuration by requiring only a single penalty
coefficient and ensures high-quality GB generation while maintaining the number
of generated GBs within an acceptable range. In the clustering phase, two key
innovations are introduced based on the GB k-nearest neighbor graph: relative
GB quality for density estimation and geodesic distance for GB distance metric.
These modifications substantially improve the performance of GBDPC on datasets
with complex manifold structures or non-uniform density distributions.
Extensive numerical experiments on 40 benchmark datasets, including both
synthetic and publicly available datasets, validate the superior performance of
the proposed LGBQPC algorithm.

Abstract: End-to-end learning has become a widely applicable and studied problem in
training predictive ML models to be aware of their impact on downstream
decision-making tasks. These end-to-end models often outperform traditional
methods that separate training from the optimization and only myopically focus
on prediction error. However, the computational complexity of end-to-end
frameworks poses a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale
problems. While training an ML model using gradient descent, each time we need
to compute a gradient we must solve an expensive optimization problem. We
present a meta-optimization method that learns efficient algorithms to
approximate optimization problems, dramatically reducing computational overhead
of solving the decision problem in general, an aspect we leverage in the
training within the end-to-end framework. Our approach introduces a neural
network architecture that near-optimally solves optimization problems while
ensuring feasibility constraints through alternate projections. We prove
exponential convergence, approximation guarantees, and generalization bounds
for our learning method. This method offers superior computational efficiency,
producing high-quality approximations faster and scaling better with problem
size compared to existing techniques. Our approach applies to a wide range of
optimization problems including deterministic, single-stage as well as
two-stage stochastic optimization problems. We illustrate how our proposed
method applies to (1) an electricity generation problem using real data from an
electricity routing company coordinating the movement of electricity throughout
13 states, (2) a shortest path problem with a computer vision task of
predicting edge costs from terrain maps, (3) a two-stage multi-warehouse
cross-fulfillment newsvendor problem, as well as a variety of other
newsvendor-like problems.

Conclusion: 连通区域数量是衡量隐式偏差的有效指标，且与泛化性能密切相关，为优化超参数提供了理论依据。

Abstract: One explanation for the strong generalization ability of neural networks is
implicit bias. Yet, the definition and mechanism of implicit bias in non-linear
contexts remains little understood. In this work, we propose to characterize
implicit bias by the count of connected regions in the input space with the
same predicted label. Compared with parameter-dependent metrics (e.g., norm or
normalized margin), region count can be better adapted to nonlinear,
overparameterized models, because it is determined by the function mapping and
is invariant to reparametrization. Empirically, we found that small region
counts align with geometrically simple decision boundaries and correlate well
with good generalization performance. We also observe that good hyper-parameter
choices such as larger learning rates and smaller batch sizes can induce small
region counts. We further establish the theoretical connections and explain how
larger learning rate can induce small region counts in neural networks.

Abstract: When the distribution of the data used to train a classifier differs from
that of the test data, i.e., under dataset shift, well-established routines for
calibrating the decision scores of the classifier, estimating the proportion of
positives in a test sample, or estimating the accuracy of the classifier,
become particularly challenging. This paper investigates the interconnections
among three fundamental problems, calibration, quantification, and classifier
accuracy prediction, under dataset shift conditions. Specifically, we prove
their equivalence through mutual reduction, i.e., we show that access to an
oracle for any one of these tasks enables the resolution of the other two.
Based on these proofs, we propose new methods for each problem based on direct
adaptations of well-established methods borrowed from the other disciplines.
Our results show such methods are often competitive, and sometimes even surpass
the performance of dedicated approaches from each discipline. The main goal of
this paper is to fostering cross-fertilization among these research areas,
encouraging the development of unified approaches and promoting synergies
across the fields.

Abstract: Accurate electricity load forecasting is essential for grid stability,
resource optimization, and renewable energy integration. While
transformer-based deep learning models like TimeGPT have gained traction in
time-series forecasting, their effectiveness in long-term electricity load
prediction remains uncertain. This study evaluates forecasting models ranging
from classical regression techniques to advanced deep learning architectures
using data from the ESD 2025 competition. The dataset includes two years of
historical electricity load data, alongside temperature and global horizontal
irradiance (GHI) across five sites, with a one-day-ahead forecasting horizon.
Since actual test set load values remain undisclosed, leveraging predicted
values would accumulate errors, making this a long-term forecasting challenge.
We employ (i) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
and (ii) frame the task as a regression problem, using temperature and GHI as
covariates to predict load for each hour, (iii) ultimately stacking 24 models
to generate yearly forecasts.
  Our results reveal that deep learning models, including TimeGPT, fail to
consistently outperform simpler statistical and machine learning approaches due
to the limited availability of training data and exogenous variables. In
contrast, XGBoost, with minimal feature engineering, delivers the lowest error
rates across all test cases while maintaining computational efficiency. This
highlights the limitations of deep learning in long-term electricity
forecasting and reinforces the importance of model selection based on dataset
characteristics rather than complexity. Our study provides insights into
practical forecasting applications and contributes to the ongoing discussion on
the trade-offs between traditional and modern forecasting methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual learning is emerging as an important paradigm, rooted in
causality, which promises to alleviate common issues of graph neural networks
(GNNs), such as fairness and interpretability. However, as in many real-world
application domains where conducting randomized controlled trials is
impractical, one has to rely on available observational (factual) data to
detect counterfactuals. In this paper, we introduce and tackle the problem of
searching for counterfactual evidences for the GNN-based node classification
task. A counterfactual evidence is a pair of nodes such that, regardless they
exhibit great similarity both in the features and in their neighborhood
subgraph structures, they are classified differently by the GNN. We develop
effective and efficient search algorithms and a novel indexing solution that
leverages both node features and structural information to identify
counterfactual evidences, and generalizes beyond any specific GNN. Through
various downstream applications, we demonstrate the potential of counterfactual
evidences to enhance fairness and accuracy of GNNs.

Result: 在视觉导航任务（FrozenLake、Maze、MiniBehavior）中，视觉规划优于基于文本的推理方法。

Conclusion: 视觉规划是一种有前景的替代方案，为需要直观图像推理的任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse
tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for
both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is
present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most
natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving
spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new
paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual
representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed
via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual
domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a
novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement
Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,
leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of
representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our
visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct
reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a
viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new
avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.

Motivation: 研究神经网络的泛化能力是深度学习的核心问题，‘grokking’现象为理解其机制提供了独特视角。

Method: 将神经网络参数视为自由度，训练损失为系统能量，通过采样Boltzmann熵景观分析‘grokking’。

Result: 实验表明‘grokking’在记忆到泛化的过渡中无熵垒，且高熵状态有助于泛化。

Conclusion: 研究提出了新的优化器WanD，消除了‘grokking’，并挑战了现有理论，为优化器设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central
question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where
NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a
near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying
mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for
grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a
physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is
the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of
liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later
generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration.
This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density)
landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in
transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in
the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous
theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a
high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking
entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's
far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on
Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any
constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides
strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to
weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new
potential ways for optimizer design.

Result: 超参数选择显著影响模型性能和不确定性质量，不同不确定性表达方式下最优参数化可能不同。

Conclusion: 需仔细调整超参数以平衡预测性能和校准质量，且不确定性表达方式可能影响最优参数化。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals encode information about relative changes
in blood volume that can be used to assess various aspects of cardiac health
non-invasively, e.g.\ to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) or predict blood
pressure (BP). Deep networks are well-equipped to handle the large quantities
of data acquired from wearable measurement devices. However, they lack
interpretability and are prone to overfitting, leaving considerable risk for
poor performance on unseen data and misdiagnosis. Here, we describe the use of
two scalable uncertainty quantification techniques: Monte Carlo Dropout and the
recently proposed Improved Variational Online Newton. These techniques are used
to assess the trustworthiness of models trained to perform AF classification
and BP regression from raw PPG time series. We find that the choice of
hyperparameters has a considerable effect on the predictive performance of the
models and on the quality and composition of predicted uncertainties. E.g. the
stochasticity of the model parameter sampling determines the proportion of the
total uncertainty that is aleatoric, and has varying effects on predictive
performance and calibration quality dependent on the chosen uncertainty
quantification technique and the chosen expression of uncertainty. We find
significant discrepancy in the quality of uncertainties over the predicted
classes, emphasising the need for a thorough evaluation protocol that assesses
local and adaptive calibration. This work suggests that the choice of
hyperparameters must be carefully tuned to balance predictive performance and
calibration quality, and that the optimal parameterisation may vary depending
on the chosen expression of uncertainty.

TL;DR: MoE-CAP是一个专为稀疏混合专家（MoE）系统设计的基准测试，揭示了当前硬件下难以平衡成本、准确性和性能（CAP）的挑战，并提出了稀疏感知性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏MoE架构在扩展大型语言模型时效率高，但依赖于异构计算和内存资源，导致CAP之间的权衡复杂化，现有基准测试难以准确捕捉这些权衡。

Method: 引入MoE-CAP基准测试，提出CAP雷达图和稀疏感知性能指标（S-MBU和S-MFU），以评估MoE系统在不同硬件和部署场景下的性能。

Result: 分析表明，当前硬件下难以同时优化CAP的三个维度，通常只能优化两个而牺牲第三个。

Conclusion: MoE-CAP为MoE系统的实际部署提供了更准确的性能评估工具，揭示了CAP权衡的动态性。

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is increasingly favored for
scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently, but it depends on
heterogeneous compute and memory resources. These factors jointly affect system
Cost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing
benchmarks often fail to capture these trade-offs accurately, complicating
practical deployment decisions. To address this, we introduce MoE-CAP, a
benchmark specifically designed for MoE systems. Our analysis reveals that
achieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE
systems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the
third-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose
the CAP Radar Diagram. We further introduce sparsity-aware performance
metrics-Sparse Memory Bandwidth Utilization (S-MBU) and Sparse Model FLOPS
Utilization (S-MFU)-to enable accurate performance benchmarking of MoE systems
across diverse hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.

Result: Mergenetic在多任务和多语言中表现优异，且仅需普通硬件支持。

Conclusion: Mergenetic为进化模型合并提供了一个高效、灵活的开源解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging allows combining the capabilities of existing models into a new
one - post hoc, without additional training. This has made it increasingly
popular thanks to its low cost and the availability of libraries that support
merging on consumer GPUs. Recent work shows that pairing merging with
evolutionary algorithms can boost performance, but no framework currently
supports flexible experimentation with such strategies in language models. We
introduce Mergenetic, an open-source library for evolutionary model merging.
Mergenetic enables easy composition of merging methods and evolutionary
algorithms while incorporating lightweight fitness estimators to reduce
evaluation costs. We describe its design and demonstrate that Mergenetic
produces competitive results across tasks and languages using modest hardware.

Abstract: We present MegaScale-MoE, a production system tailored for the efficient
training of large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. MoE emerges as a
promising architecture to scale large language models (LLMs) to unprecedented
sizes, thereby enhancing model performance. However, existing MoE training
systems experience a degradation in training efficiency, exacerbated by the
escalating scale of MoE models and the continuous evolution of hardware.
  Recognizing the pivotal role of efficient communication in enhancing MoE
training, MegaScale-MoE customizes communication-efficient parallelism
strategies for attention and FFNs in each MoE layer and adopts a holistic
approach to overlap communication with computation at both inter- and
intra-operator levels. Additionally, MegaScale-MoE applies communication
compression with adjusted communication patterns to lower precision, further
improving training efficiency. When training a 352B MoE model on 1,440 NVIDIA
Hopper GPUs, MegaScale-MoE achieves a training throughput of 1.41M tokens/s,
improving the efficiency by 1.88$\times$ compared to Megatron-LM. We share our
operational experience in accelerating MoE training and hope that by offering
our insights in system design, this work will motivate future research in MoE

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IWDD是一种新的生成框架，结合扩散模型预训练和重要性加权分数蒸馏，用于快速准确的因果估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决观测数据中个体化治疗效果估计的挑战，尤其是协变量不平衡和非随机治疗分配带来的混淆偏差。

Method: 提出重要性加权扩散蒸馏（IWDD），将逆概率加权（IPW）融入扩散模型蒸馏，并引入随机化调整以减少梯度估计方差。

Result: IWDD在样本外预测性能上达到最优，显著提升因果估计效果。

Conclusion: IWDD为个体化治疗策略开发提供了有效工具，代码将开源以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data is a
central challenge in causal inference, largely due to covariate imbalance and
confounding bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. While inverse
probability weighting (IPW) is a well-established solution to this problem, its
integration into modern deep learning frameworks remains limited. In this work,
we propose Importance-Weighted Diffusion Distillation (IWDD), a novel
generative framework that combines the pretraining of diffusion models with
importance-weighted score distillation to enable accurate and fast causal
estimation-including potential outcome prediction and treatment effect
estimation. We demonstrate how IPW can be naturally incorporated into the
distillation of pretrained diffusion models, and further introduce a
randomization-based adjustment that eliminates the need to compute IPW
explicitly-thereby simplifying computation and, more importantly, provably
reducing the variance of gradient estimates. Empirical results show that IWDD
achieves state-of-the-art out-of-sample prediction performance, with the
highest win rates compared to other baselines, significantly improving causal
estimation and supporting the development of individualized treatment
strategies. We will release our PyTorch code for reproducibility and future
research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信号衰减的多智能体强化学习方法，解决了传统方法对全局状态观测的依赖问题，适用于无线通信和雷达网络中的功率分配任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习方法需要全局状态观测，限制了算法的去中心化和可扩展性。信号衰减特性在无线通信和雷达网络中普遍存在，但相关应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了两种约束多智能体马尔可夫决策过程模型，推导了全局价值函数和梯度估计的局部邻域近似方法，并开发了去中心化的鞍点策略梯度算法。

Result: 通过雷达网络中的目标检测功率分配问题验证了方法的有效性，并提供了误差界限分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为无线通信和雷达网络中的其他问题提供了可扩展的去中心化解决方案模型。

Abstract: Classic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods require that agents
enjoy global state observability, preventing development of decentralized
algorithms and limiting scalability. Recent work has shown that, under
assumptions on decaying inter-agent influence, global observability can be
replaced by local neighborhood observability at each agent, enabling
decentralization and scalability. Real-world applications enjoying such decay
properties remain underexplored, however, despite the fact that signal power
decay, or signal attenuation, due to path loss is an intrinsic feature of many
problems in wireless communications and radar networks. In this paper, we show
that signal attenuation enables decentralization in MARL by considering the
illustrative special case of performing power allocation for target detection
in a radar network. To achieve this, we propose two new constrained multi-agent
Markov decision process formulations of this power allocation problem, derive
local neighborhood approximations for global value function and gradient
estimates and establish corresponding error bounds, and develop decentralized
saddle point policy gradient algorithms for solving the proposed problems. Our
approach, though oriented towards the specific radar network problem we
consider, provides a useful model for future extensions to additional problems
in wireless communications and radar networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在微控制器（MCU）上运行AI模型时，内存效率和实时性是关键挑战。

Method: 采用基于补丁的融合方法，通过有向无环图探索融合解空间，优化CNN的数据流。

Result: msf-CNN比现有技术（MCUNetV2和StreamNet）减少50%的RAM使用。

Conclusion: msf-CNN为系统设计者提供了更高的灵活性和效率。

Abstract: AI spans from large language models to tiny models running on
microcontrollers (MCUs). Extremely memory-efficient model architectures are
decisive to fit within an MCU's tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. However,
inference latency must remain small to fit real-time constraints. An approach
to tackle this is patch-based fusion, which aims to optimize data flows across
neural network layers. In this paper, we introduce msf-CNN, a novel technique
that efficiently finds optimal fusion settings for convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) by walking through the fusion solution space represented as a
directed acyclic graph. Compared to previous work on CNN fusion for MCUs,
msf-CNN identifies a wider set of solutions. We published an implementation of
msf-CNN running on various microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32). We
show that msf-CNN can achieve inference using 50% less RAM compared to the
prior art (MCUNetV2 and StreamNet). We thus demonstrate how msf-CNN offers
additional flexibility for system designers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究分析了物理信息机器学习（PIML）在交通流建模中的表现，发现其失败原因并非物理残差阻碍优化，而是需要ML与物理梯度形成锐角且位于锥形区域内。实验表明，物理残差可能降低模型性能，稀疏采样和时间平均数据会误导物理残差。CFL条件是数据集适用性的关键指标，高阶模型误差下限更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨PIML在交通流建模中的失败原因，挑战物理残差阻碍优化的常见假设。

Method: 通过扰动训练模型并分析Hessian矩阵的主特征向量，评估损失值，研究ML与物理梯度的关系。

Result: 物理残差不直接阻碍优化，但需满足梯度条件；稀疏采样和平均数据会误导模型；CFL条件是关键指标；高阶模型误差更大。

Conclusion: PIML成功需满足梯度条件，数据集需符合CFL条件，高阶模型性能可能更差。

Abstract: This study critically examines the performance of physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) approaches for traffic flow modeling, defining the failure of a
PIML model as the scenario where it underperforms both its purely data-driven
and purely physics-based counterparts. We analyze the loss landscape by
perturbing trained models along the principal eigenvectors of the Hessian
matrix and evaluating corresponding loss values. Our results suggest that
physics residuals in PIML do not inherently hinder optimization, contrary to a
commonly assumed failure cause. Instead, successful parameter updates require
both ML and physics gradients to form acute angles with the quasi-true gradient
and lie within a conical region. Given inaccuracies in both the physics models
and the training data, satisfying this condition is often difficult.
Experiments reveal that physical residuals can degrade the performance of LWR-
and ARZ-based PIML models, especially under highly physics-driven settings.
Moreover, sparse sampling and the use of temporally averaged traffic data can
produce misleadingly small physics residuals that fail to capture actual
physical dynamics, contributing to model failure. We also identify the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition as a key indicator of dataset
suitability for PIML, where successful applications consistently adhere to this
criterion. Lastly, we observe that higher-order models like ARZ tend to have
larger error lower bounds than lower-order models like LWR, which is consistent
with the experimental findings of existing studies.

TL;DR: LLM-Explorer是一种高效且经济的移动应用探索代理，通过减少对LLM的依赖并专注于知识维护，显著降低了成本和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的探索方法过度依赖LLM生成动作，导致高昂的token费用和计算资源消耗，且效果不佳。

Method: LLM-Explorer主要利用LLM维护知识而非生成动作，通过知识指导动作生成，减少对LLM的直接依赖。

Result: 在20个典型应用上与5个基线方法比较，LLM-Explorer实现了最快和最高的覆盖率，成本比现有LLM方法低148倍。

Conclusion: LLM-Explorer证明了通过优化LLM使用方式，可以在保持高效探索的同时显著降低成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automated
mobile app exploration, an important and challenging problem that used to
suffer from the difficulty of generating meaningful UI interactions. However,
existing LLM-based exploration approaches rely heavily on LLMs to generate
actions in almost every step, leading to a huge cost of token fees and
computational resources. We argue that such extensive usage of LLMs is neither
necessary nor effective, since many actions during exploration do not require,
or may even be biased by the abilities of LLMs. Further, based on the insight
that a precise and compact knowledge plays the central role for effective
exploration, we introduce LLM-Explorer, a new exploration agent designed for
efficiency and affordability. LLM-Explorer uses LLMs primarily for maintaining
the knowledge instead of generating actions, and knowledge is used to guide
action generation in a LLM-less manner. Based on a comparison with 5 strong
baselines on 20 typical apps, LLM-Explorer was able to achieve the fastest and
highest coverage among all automated app explorers, with over 148x lower cost
than the state-of-the-art LLM-based approach.

Conclusion: VulTrial通过多代理交互和角色调优显著提升漏洞检测性能，同时展示了在成本效益模型上的潜力。

Abstract: Detecting vulnerabilities in source code remains a critical yet challenging
task, especially when benign and vulnerable functions share significant
similarities. In this work, we introduce VulTrial, a courtroom-inspired
multi-agent framework designed to enhance automated vulnerability detection. It
employs four role-specific agents, which are security researcher, code author,
moderator, and review board. Through extensive experiments using GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4o we demonstrate that Vultrial outperforms single-agent and multi-agent
baselines. Using GPT-4o, VulTrial improves the performance by 102.39% and
84.17% over its respective baseline. Additionally, we show that role-specific
instruction tuning in multi-agent with small data (50 pair samples) improves
the performance of VulTrial further by 139.89% and 118.30%. Furthermore, we
analyze the impact of increasing the number of agent interactions on VulTrial's
overall performance. While multi-agent setups inherently incur higher costs due
to increased token usage, our findings reveal that applying VulTrial to a
cost-effective model like GPT-3.5 can improve its performance by 69.89%
compared to GPT-4o in a single-agent setting, at a lower overall cost.

Abstract: Decompilers are fundamental tools for critical security tasks, from
vulnerability discovery to malware analysis, yet their evaluation remains
fragmented. Existing approaches primarily focus on syntactic correctness
through synthetic micro-benchmarks or subjective human ratings, failing to
address real-world requirements for semantic fidelity and analyst usability. We
present DecompileBench, the first comprehensive framework that enables
effective evaluation of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows through
three key components: \textit{real-world function extraction} (comprising
23,400 functions from 130 real-world programs), \textit{runtime-aware
validation}, and \textit{automated human-centric assessment} using LLM-as-Judge
to quantify the effectiveness of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows.
Through a systematic comparison between six industrial-strength decompilers and
six recent LLM-powered approaches, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods
surpass commercial tools in code understandability despite 52.2% lower
functionality correctness. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based
approaches to transform human-centric reverse engineering. We open source

Abstract: Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science,

simulations (DNS) of such systems are computationally prohibitive. To address
this, we present a novel physics-informed spatio-temporal surrogate model for
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid
flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks for spatial feature
extraction with an innovative recurrent architecture inspired by large language
models, comprising a context builder and a sequence generator to capture
temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial
differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Given the
sensitivity of turbulent convection to initial conditions, we quantify
uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key
features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost,
offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.

residents were organized into 19 groups to record their pedestrian mobility
while engaging in protocolized playful social actions. Their GPS identified
opportunity units for meaningful public space activation. Although 56% of
observed actions occurred within expert-defined units, the remaining 44% took
place elsewhere. Clustering analysis of geo-located action stops revealed seven
distinct clusters, highlighting overlooked areas with significant social
potential. These findings underscore the complementarity of top-down and
bottom-up approaches, demonstrating how citizen science and community science
approaches enriches urban diagnostics by integrating subjective,
community-based perspectives in public space placemaking and informing
inclusive, adaptive sustainable urban transformation strategies.

TL;DR: 扩散模型在图像、音频等领域表现优异，但其正向过程对高频成分的快速噪声化导致逆向过程生成质量下降。通过调整正向过程，使所有频率噪声化速率一致，可显著提升高频主导数据的生成质量。

Conclusion: 调整正向过程的噪声化速率可以改善高频成分的生成质量，为扩散模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models on data modalities
such as images, audio, proteins and materials. These modalities share the
property of exponentially decaying variance and magnitude in the Fourier
domain. Under the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
forward process of additive white noise, this property results in
high-frequency components being corrupted faster and earlier in terms of their
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than low-frequency ones. The reverse process then
generates low-frequency information before high-frequency details. In this
work, we study the inductive bias of the forward process of diffusion models in
Fourier space. We theoretically analyse and empirically demonstrate that the
faster noising of high-frequency components in DDPM results in violations of
the normality assumption in the reverse process. Our experiments show that this
leads to degraded generation quality of high-frequency components. We then
study an alternate forward process in Fourier space which corrupts all
frequencies at the same rate, removing the typical frequency hierarchy during
generation, and demonstrate marked performance improvements on datasets where
high frequencies are primary, while performing on par with DDPM on standard
imaging benchmarks.

*Frederik Köhne,Anton Schiela*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的指数移动平均方法（$p$-EMA），通过调整权重分配方式，解决了传统EMA在随机收敛性上的不足，并提供了理论保证和应用示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指数移动平均（EMA）在随机动态系统中无法实现强收敛性，因为其权重分配方式导致噪声无法完全消除。

Method: 提出$p$-EMA方法，将权重分配调整为次谐波速率递减，从而确保噪声逐渐减少。

Result: 在温和的自相关假设下，$p$-EMA具有随机收敛性保证。

Conclusion: $p$-EMA不仅解决了EMA的收敛性问题，还为随机梯度下降（SGD）中的自适应步长控制提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Averaging, or smoothing, is a fundamental approach to obtain stable,
de-noised estimates from noisy observations. In certain scenarios, observations
made along trajectories of random dynamical systems are of particular interest.
One popular smoothing technique for such a scenario is exponential moving
averaging (EMA), which assigns observations a weight that decreases
exponentially in their age, thus giving younger observations a larger weight.
However, EMA fails to enjoy strong stochastic convergence properties, which
stems from the fact that the weight assigned to the youngest observation is
constant over time, preventing the noise in the averaged quantity from
decreasing to zero. In this work, we consider an adaptation to EMA, which we
call $p$-EMA, where the weights assigned to the last observations decrease to
zero at a subharmonic rate. We provide stochastic convergence guarantees for
this kind of averaging under mild assumptions on the autocorrelations of the
underlying random dynamical system. We further discuss the implications of our
results for a recently introduced adaptive step size control for Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD), which uses $p$-EMA for averaging noisy observations.

Motivation: 研究在几何边界条件下分类问题的学习率，填补理论空白，尤其是无噪声场景下的下界推导。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov熵的Lebesgue范数描述函数类，推导学习率的上界和下界。

Result: 在Barron正则函数和强边界Hölder连续函数中，学习率接近最优的O(n^-1)；在强边界凸函数中，学习率接近O(n^-1/2)。

Conclusion: 论文在几何边界条件下提供了广泛函数类的最优学习率，解决了理论难题，并展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study classification problems using binary estimators where the decision
boundary is described by horizon functions and where the data distribution
satisfies a geometric margin condition. We establish upper and lower bounds for
the minimax learning rate over broad function classes with bounded Kolmogorov
entropy in Lebesgue norms. A key novelty of our work is the derivation of lower
bounds on the worst-case learning rates under a geometric margin condition -- a
setting that is almost universally satisfied in practice but remains
theoretically challenging. Moreover, our results deal with the noiseless
setting, where lower bounds are particularly hard to establish. We apply our
general results to classification problems with decision boundaries belonging
to several function classes: for Barron-regular functions, and for
H\"older-continuous functions with strong margins, we identify optimal rates
close to the fast learning rates of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ for $n \in
\mathbb{N}$ samples. Also for merely convex decision boundaries, in a strong
margin case optimal rates near $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ can be achieved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The success of unsupervised learning raises the question of whether also
supervised models can be trained without using the information in the output
$y$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is indeed possible. The key step
is to formulate the model as a smoother, i.e. on the form $\hat{f}=Sy$, and to
construct the smoother matrix $S$ independently of $y$, e.g. by training on
random labels. We present a simple model selection criterion based on the
distribution of the out-of-sample predictions and show that, in contrast to
cross-validation, this criterion can be used also without access to $y$. We
demonstrate on real and synthetic data that $y$-free trained versions of linear
and kernel ridge regression, smoothing splines, and neural networks perform
similarly to their standard, $y$-based, versions and, most importantly,
significantly better than random guessing.

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化定价问题，显著提升了贝叶斯网络结构学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a score-based Integer Programming (IP) approach
for solving the Bayesian Network Structure Learning (BNSL) problem.
State-of-the-art BNSL IP formulations suffer from the exponentially large
number of variables and constraints. A standard approach in IP to address such
challenges is to employ row and column generation techniques, which dynamically
generate rows and columns, while the complex pricing problem remains a
computational bottleneck for BNSL. For the general class of $\ell_0$-penalized
likelihood scores, we show how the pricing problem can be reformulated as a
difference of submodular optimization problem, and how the Difference of Convex
Algorithm (DCA) can be applied as an inexact method to efficiently solve the
pricing problems. Empirically, we show that, for continuous Gaussian data, our
row and column generation approach yields solutions with higher quality than
state-of-the-art score-based approaches, especially when the graph density
increases, and achieves comparable performance against benchmark
constraint-based and hybrid approaches, even when the graph size increases.

Conclusion: Nash为结构化协变量的稀疏回归提供了一种高效且灵活的统一框架。

Abstract: Sparse linear regression is a fundamental tool in data analysis. However,
traditional approaches often fall short when covariates exhibit structure or
arise from heterogeneous sources. In biomedical applications, covariates may
stem from distinct modalities or be structured according to an underlying
graph. We introduce Neural Adaptive Shrinkage (Nash), a unified framework that
integrates covariate-specific side information into sparse regression via
neural networks. Nash adaptively modulates penalties on a per-covariate basis,
learning to tailor regularization without cross-validation. We develop a
variational inference algorithm for efficient training and establish
connections to empirical Bayes regression. Experiments on real data demonstrate
that Nash can improve accuracy and adaptability over existing methods.

Abstract: Probabilistic next-token prediction trained using cross-entropy loss is the
basis of most large language models. Given a sequence of previous values,
next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the
vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token
sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead,
random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their
consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although
consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a
well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to
the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction
converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent
with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability
distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the
entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all
probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal
for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see
that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval
and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing
the correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important
and many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous
scenarios.

Result: 理论分析表明乘积核具有表达性和稳定性，实验证明SA-REMBO在传统方法失败的高维任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: SA-REMBO为复杂高维设计空间提供了灵活且可扩展的贝叶斯优化框架。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) in high-dimensional spaces remains fundamentally
limited by the curse of dimensionality and the rigidity of global
low-dimensional assumptions. While Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization
(REMBO) mitigates this via linear projections into low-dimensional subspaces,
it typically assumes a single global embedding and a stationary objective. In
this work, we introduce Self-Adaptive embedding REMBO (SA-REMBO), a novel
framework that generalizes REMBO to support multiple random Gaussian
embeddings, each capturing a different local subspace structure of the
high-dimensional objective. An index variable governs the embedding choice and
is jointly modeled with the latent optimization variable via a product kernel
in a Gaussian Process surrogate. This enables the optimizer to adaptively
select embeddings conditioned on location, effectively capturing locally
varying effective dimensionality, nonstationarity, and heteroscedasticity in
the objective landscape. We theoretically analyze the expressiveness and
stability of the index-conditioned product kernel and empirically demonstrate
the advantage of our method across synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
benchmarks, where traditional REMBO and other low-rank BO methods fail. Our
results establish SA-REMBO as a powerful and flexible extension for scalable BO
in complex, structured design spaces.

TL;DR: 本文研究了约束贝叶斯优化（CBO）方法中的约束期望改进（CEI）算法的收敛速率，并给出了其简单遗憾上界的理论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CEI算法在带约束的黑盒优化中广泛应用，但其理论收敛速率尚未明确，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过假设目标函数和约束函数分别位于再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）或高斯过程（GP）中，分析CEI算法的收敛速率。

Result: 证明了CEI在平方指数核和Matérn核下的收敛速率分别为O(t^(-1/2)log^(d+1)/2(t))和O(t^(-ν/(2ν+d))log^(ν/(2ν+d))(t))，并在GP假设下验证了相同结果。

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了理论分析的正确性，为CEI算法的实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) methods have seen significant success
in black-box optimization with constraints, and one of the most commonly used
CBO methods is the constrained expected improvement (CEI) algorithm. CEI is a
natural extension of the expected improvement (EI) when constraints are
incorporated. However, the theoretical convergence rate of CEI has not been
established. In this work, we study the convergence rate of CEI by analyzing
its simple regret upper bound. First, we show that when the objective function
$f$ and constraint function $c$ are assumed to each lie in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS), CEI achieves the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}
\left(t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\log^{\frac{d+1}{2}}(t) \right) \ \text{and }\
\mathcal{O}\left(t^{\frac{-\nu}{2\nu+d}} \log^{\frac{\nu}{2\nu+d}}(t)\right)$
for the commonly used squared exponential and Mat\'{e}rn kernels, respectively.
Second, we show that when $f$ and $c$ are assumed to be sampled from Gaussian
processes (GPs), CEI achieves the same convergence rates with a high
probability. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical
analysis.

Method: 结合变分学习和MCMC，开发了一种粒子EM方法，同时通过变分方法在大规模数据中寻找诱导点，并通过采样方法准确训练GPs。

Result: 提出了一种高效且准确的方法，适用于大规模数据的深度GPs训练，并在标准基准问题上进行了验证。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度GPs在大规模数据和多尺度特征下的训练效率和准确性。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have gained popularity as flexible machine learning
models for regression and function approximation with an in-built method for
uncertainty quantification. However, GPs suffer when the amount of training
data is large or when the underlying function contains multi-scale features
that are difficult to represent by a stationary kernel. To address the former,
training of GPs with large-scale data is often performed through inducing point
approximations (also known as sparse GP regression (GPR)), where the size of
the covariance matrices in GPR is reduced considerably through a greedy search
on the data set. To aid the latter, deep GPs have gained traction as
hierarchical models that resolve multi-scale features by combining multiple
GPs. Posterior inference in deep GPs requires a sampling or, more usual, a
variational approximation. Variational approximations lead to large-scale
stochastic, non-convex optimisation problems and the resulting approximation
tends to represent uncertainty incorrectly. In this work, we combine
variational learning with MCMC to develop a particle-based
expectation-maximisation method to simultaneously find inducing points within
the large-scale data (variationally) and accurately train the GPs
(sampling-based). The result is a highly efficient and accurate methodology for
deep GP training on large-scale data. We test our method on standard benchmark
problems.

Result: 在聚类良好且最小度为Ω̃(√n)的图上，算法能以常数隐私预算实现局部差分隐私。

Conclusion: 实验表明，该方法在相同条件下优于基于随机响应结果的谱聚类。

Abstract: We propose a locally differentially private graph clustering algorithm.
Previous works have explored this problem, including approaches that apply
spectral clustering to graphs generated via the randomized response algorithm.
However, these methods only achieve accurate results when the privacy budget is
in $\Omega(\log n)$, which is unsuitable for many practical applications. In
response, we present an interactive algorithm based on the power iteration
method. Given that the noise introduced by the largest eigenvector constant can
be significant, we incorporate a technique to eliminate this constant. As a
result, our algorithm attains local differential privacy with a constant
privacy budget when the graph is well-clustered and has a minimum degree of
$\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$. In contrast, while randomized response has been
shown to produce accurate results under the same minimum degree condition, it
is limited to graphs generated from the stochastic block model. We perform
experiments to demonstrate that our method outperforms spectral clustering
applied to randomized response results.

Conclusion: MID-L是一种通用的动态计算层，适用于计算受限的系统，同时兼顾效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often activate all neurons for every input, leading to
unnecessary computation and inefficiency. We introduce Matrix-Interpolated
Dropout Layer (MID-L), a novel module that dynamically selects and activates
only the most informative neurons by interpolating between two transformation
paths via a learned, input-dependent gating vector. Unlike conventional dropout
or static sparsity methods, MID-L employs a differentiable Top-k masking
strategy, enabling per-input adaptive computation while maintaining end-to-end
differentiability. MID-L is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing architectures. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks, including
MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, UCI Adult, and IMDB, show that MID-L achieves
up to average 55\% reduction in active neurons, 1.7$\times$ FLOPs savings, and
maintains or exceeds baseline accuracy. We further validate the informativeness
and selectivity of the learned neurons via Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) and
observe improved robustness under overfitting and noisy data conditions.
Additionally, MID-L demonstrates favorable inference latency and memory usage
profiles, making it suitable for both research exploration and deployment on
compute-constrained systems. These results position MID-L as a general-purpose,
plug-and-play dynamic computation layer, bridging the gap between dropout
regularization and efficient inference.

Abstract: Cluttered garments manipulation poses significant challenges due to the
complex, deformable nature of garments and intricate garment relations. Unlike
single-garment manipulation, cluttered scenarios require managing complex
garment entanglements and interactions, while maintaining garment cleanliness
and manipulation stability. To address these demands, we propose to learn
point-level affordance, the dense representation modeling the complex space and
multi-modal manipulation candidates, while being aware of garment geometry,
structure, and inter-object relations. Additionally, as it is difficult to
directly retrieve a garment in some extremely entangled clutters, we introduce
an adaptation module, guided by learned affordance, to reorganize
highly-entangled garments into states plausible for manipulation. Our framework
demonstrates effectiveness over environments featuring diverse garment types
and pile configurations in both simulation and the real world. Project page:

Abstract: As autonomous systems become integral to various industries, effective
strategies for fault handling are essential to ensure reliability and
efficiency. Transfer of Control (ToC), a traditional approach for interrupting
automated processes during faults, is often triggered unnecessarily in
non-critical situations. To address this, we propose a data-driven method that
uses human interaction data to train AI models capable of preemptively

interactive tool simulating an industrial vacuum cleaner, we collected data and
developed an LSTM-based model to predict user behavior. Our findings reveal
that even data from non-experts can effectively train models to reduce

performance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward.
However, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots
often contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness
frequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend
heavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more
prevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This
paper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects
LLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we
propose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench),
where we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning
performance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%. We also observe that
most failure cases stem from missing objects in planners. To mitigate the REs
issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach: task-oriented context
cognition, which generates clear instructions for robots, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to aware prompt and chains of thought.
This work contributes to the research community of human-robot interaction
(HRI) by making robot task planning more practical, particularly for non-expert
users, e.g., the elderly and children.

Abstract: Accurate temporal reconstructions of plant growth are essential for plant
phenotyping and breeding, yet remain challenging due to complex geometries,
occlusions, and non-rigid deformations of plants. We present a novel framework
for building temporal digital twins of plants by combining 3D Gaussian
Splatting with a robust sample alignment pipeline. Our method begins by
reconstructing Gaussian Splats from multi-view camera data, then leverages a
two-stage registration approach: coarse alignment through feature-based
matching and Fast Global Registration, followed by fine alignment with
Iterative Closest Point. This pipeline yields a consistent 4D model of plant
development in discrete time steps. We evaluate the approach on data from the
Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center, demonstrating detailed temporal

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale offline training have demonstrated the
potential of generalist policy learning for complex robotic tasks. However,
applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to
continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse
terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GROQLoco, a scalable,
attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy
across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline
datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct
locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain
traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to
train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion for both behaviors.
Crucially, our framework operates directly on proprioceptive data from all
robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is
directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs
without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
strong zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains,
including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg
robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where
different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe
successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all
robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg
quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning.
These results highlight the potential for robust generalist locomotion across
diverse robots and terrains.

Conclusion: DexGarmentLab和HALO为灵巧服装操作提供了高效解决方案，显著推进了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a critical challenge due to the diversity in garment
categories, geometries, and deformations. Despite this, humans can effortlessly
handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing
research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity,
primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment
manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment
specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation,
which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and
refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the
sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or
training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive
and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence
to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a
single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention.
However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of
garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve
generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a
Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies
transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then
generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive
experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate
that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing
to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and
deformation where others fail. Our project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和平面运动学的新方法，用于移动机器人速度估计，摆脱了对轮地摩擦假设的依赖，并在实验中表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统速度估计方法依赖轮地摩擦假设或复杂动力学模型，难以适应多变环境条件，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 结合事件相机的光流数据和平面运动学，摆脱了对轮地摩擦的依赖，利用事件相机的高动态范围和低延迟特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在横向误差上比现有Event-VIO方法提升了38.3%，并在高速场景下验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和鲁棒性上表现优异，具有实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate velocity estimation is critical in mobile robotics, particularly for
driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. Wheel odometry fused with
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data is a widely used method for velocity
estimation; however, it typically requires strong assumptions, such as non-slip
steering, or complex vehicle dynamics models that do not hold under varying
environmental conditions like slippery surfaces. We introduce an approach to
velocity estimation that is decoupled from wheel-to-surface traction
assumptions by leveraging planar kinematics in combination with optical flow
from event cameras pointed perpendicularly at the ground. The asynchronous
micro-second latency and high dynamic range of event cameras make them highly
robust to motion blur, a common challenge in vision-based perception techniques
for autonomous driving. The proposed method is evaluated through in-field
experiments on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform and compared to precise
motion capture data, demonstrating not only performance on par with the
state-of-the-art Event-VIO method but also a 38.3 % improvement in lateral
error. Qualitative experiments at highway speeds of up to 32 m/s further
confirm the effectiveness of our approach, indicating significant potential for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: As robots for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) gradually become more
accessible and modular, we believe there is a great opportunity to rethink and
expand the visualization and control paradigms that have characterized surgical
teleoperation since its inception. We conjecture that introducing one or more
additional adjustable viewpoints in the abdominal cavity would not only unlock
novel visualization and collaboration strategies for surgeons but also
substantially boost the robustness of machine perception toward shared
autonomy. Immediate advantages include controlling a second viewpoint and
teleoperating surgical tools from a different perspective, which would allow
collaborating surgeons to adjust their views independently and still maneuver
their robotic instruments intuitively. Furthermore, we believe that capturing
synchronized multi-view 3D measurements of the patient's anatomy would unlock
advanced scene representations. Accurate real-time intraoperative 3D perception
will allow algorithmic assistants to directly control one or more robotic
instruments and/or robotic cameras. Toward these goals, we are building a
synchronized multi-viewpoint, multi-sensor robotic surgery system by
integrating high-performance vision components and upgrading the da Vinci
Research Kit control logic. This short paper reports a functional summary of
our setup and elaborates on its potential impacts in research and future
clinical practice. By fully open-sourcing our system, we will enable the
research community to reproduce our setup, improve it, and develop powerful
algorithms, effectively boosting clinical translation of cutting-edge research.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于视觉的机器人抓取中，利用多视角图像提升抓取精度的问题，并提出通过新颖视角合成技术（如高斯泼溅）生成虚拟图像以补充稀疏的真实视角，从而提高抓取覆盖率和力闭合抓取数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人抓取任务中，多视角图像能提供更多信息以提高抓取精度，但移动相机获取多视角图像耗时且可能受限于可达性。因此，研究如何通过虚拟视角合成技术补充真实视角，以提升抓取效果。

Method: 使用高斯泼溅等场景表示方法，从稀疏的真实视角合成虚拟图像，生成额外的抓取上下文。实验基于Graspnet-1billion数据集，比较真实视角与合成视角的抓取效果。

Result: 实验表明，合成视角不仅补充了稀疏真实视角的力闭合抓取，还提高了抓取覆盖率。

Conclusion: 新颖视角合成为机器人抓取提供了额外上下文，未来可扩展至单图像构建的辐射场抓取提取，结合扩散模型或通用辐射场技术。

Abstract: Vision based robot manipulation uses cameras to capture one or more images of
a scene containing the objects to be manipulated. Taking multiple images can
help if any object is occluded from one viewpoint but more visible from another
viewpoint. However, the camera has to be moved to a sequence of suitable
positions for capturing multiple images, which requires time and may not always
be possible, due to reachability constraints. So while additional images can
produce more accurate grasp poses due to the extra information available, the
time-cost goes up with the number of additional views sampled. Scene
representations like Gaussian Splatting are capable of rendering accurate
photorealistic virtual images from user-specified novel viewpoints. In this
work, we show initial results which indicate that novel view synthesis can
provide additional context in generating grasp poses. Our experiments on the
Graspnet-1billion dataset show that novel views contributed force-closure
grasps in addition to the force-closure grasps obtained from sparsely sampled
real views while also improving grasp coverage. In the future we hope this work
can be extended to improve grasp extraction from radiance fields constructed
with a single input image, using for example diffusion models or generalizable
radiance fields.

Motivation: 解决家庭机器人个性化重排任务中的挑战，包括无明确指令的个性化、有意义的环境放置以及对新物体和环境的泛化能力。

Method: 提出PARSEC基准和ContextSortLM模型，利用多场景上下文学习用户偏好，并在部分安排的环境中放置物体。

Result: ContextSortLM在复制用户排列和目标环境类别中表现最佳，多上下文模型优于单上下文模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了跨环境类别语义建模的挑战，并提出了未来工作的建议。

Abstract: Object rearrangement is a key task for household robots requiring
personalization without explicit instructions, meaningful object placement in
environments occupied with objects, and generalization to unseen objects and
new environments. To facilitate research addressing these challenges, we
introduce PARSEC, an object rearrangement benchmark for learning user
organizational preferences from observed scene context to place objects in a
partially arranged environment. PARSEC is built upon a novel dataset of 110K
rearrangement examples crowdsourced from 72 users, featuring 93 object
categories and 15 environments. We also propose ContextSortLM, an LLM-based
rearrangement model that places objects in partially arranged environments by
adapting to user preferences from prior and current scene context while
accounting for multiple valid placements. We evaluate ContextSortLM and
existing personalized rearrangement approaches on the PARSEC benchmark and
complement these findings with a crowdsourced evaluation of 108 online raters
ranking model predictions based on alignment with user preferences. Our results
indicate that personalized rearrangement models leveraging multiple scene
context sources perform better than models relying on a single context source.
Moreover, ContextSortLM outperforms other models in placing objects to
replicate the target user's arrangement and ranks among the top two in all
three environment categories, as rated by online evaluators. Importantly, our
evaluation highlights challenges associated with modeling environment semantics
across different environment categories and provides recommendations for future
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在视觉-语言-动作模型中表现优异，但训练效率不足，尤其是当生成条件难以区分时，训练目标会退化为建模边际动作分布（损失崩溃）。

Method: 提出Cocos方法，通过使条件流匹配中的源分布依赖于条件输入，增强条件整合，避免损失崩溃。

Result: 实验证明Cocos在仿真和真实场景中均表现优异，收敛更快且成功率更高，参数和梯度步骤更少。

Conclusion: Cocos是一种轻量级、易实现且通用的扩散策略训练改进方法。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a mainstream paradigm for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Although they demonstrate strong robot
control capabilities, their training efficiency remains suboptimal. In this
work, we identify a fundamental challenge in conditional diffusion policy
training: when generative conditions are hard to distinguish, the training
objective degenerates into modeling the marginal action distribution, a
phenomenon we term loss collapse. To overcome this, we propose Cocos, a simple
yet general solution that modifies the source distribution in the conditional
flow matching to be condition-dependent. By anchoring the source distribution
around semantics extracted from condition inputs, Cocos encourages stronger
condition integration and prevents the loss collapse. We provide theoretical
justification and extensive empirical results across simulation and real-world
benchmarks. Our method achieves faster convergence and higher success rates
than existing approaches, matching the performance of large-scale pre-trained
VLAs using significantly fewer gradient steps and parameters. Cocos is
lightweight, easy to implement, and compatible with diverse policy
architectures, offering a general-purpose improvement to diffusion policy
training.

Result: 任务成功率提升21%，验证模型对新颖和已知任务分别提升24%和36%。

Conclusion: VERGSA首次实现验证驱动的技能学习，免去手动奖励设计的繁琐。

Abstract: Generative skill acquisition enables embodied agents to actively learn a
scalable and evolving repertoire of control skills, crucial for the advancement
of large decision models. While prior approaches often rely on supervision
signals from generalist agents (e.g., LLMs), their effectiveness in complex 3D
environments remains unclear; exhaustive evaluation incurs substantial
computational costs, significantly hindering the efficiency of skill learning.
Inspired by recent successes in verification models for mathematical reasoning,
we propose VERGSA (Verifying Embodied Reasoning in Generative Skill
Acquisition), a framework that systematically integrates real-time verification
principles into embodied skill learning. VERGSA establishes 1) a seamless
extension from verification of mathematical reasoning into embodied learning by
dynamically incorporating contextually relevant tasks into prompts and defining
success metrics for both subtasks and overall tasks, and 2) an automated,
scalable reward labeling scheme that synthesizes dense reward signals by
iteratively finalizing the contribution of scene configuration and subtask
learning to overall skill acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, this
approach constitutes the first comprehensive training dataset for
verification-driven generative skill acquisition, eliminating arduous manual
reward engineering. Experiments validate the efficacy of our approach: 1) the
exemplar task pool improves the average task success rates by 21%, 2) our
verification model boosts success rates by 24% for novel tasks and 36% for
encountered tasks, and 3) outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines in verification
quality.

Conclusion: ARAS在任务成功率和完成时间上接近侵入性技术，为非侵入性高维控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Current invasive assistive technologies are designed to infer
high-dimensional motor control signals from severely paralyzed patients.
However, they face significant challenges, including public acceptance, limited
longevity, and barriers to commercialization. Meanwhile, noninvasive
alternatives often rely on artifact-prone signals, require lengthy user
training, and struggle to deliver robust high-dimensional control for dexterous
tasks. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel human-centered
multimodal AI approach as intelligent compensatory mechanisms for lost motor
functions that could potentially enable patients with severe paralysis to
control high-dimensional assistive devices, such as dexterous robotic arms,
using limited and noninvasive inputs. In contrast to the current
state-of-the-art (SoTA) noninvasive approaches, our context-aware, multimodal
shared-autonomy framework integrates deep reinforcement learning algorithms to
blend limited low-dimensional user input with real-time environmental
perception, enabling adaptive, dynamic, and intelligent interpretation of human
intent for complex dexterous manipulation tasks, such as pick-and-place. The
results from our ARAS (Adaptive Reinforcement learning for Amplification of
limited inputs in Shared autonomy) trained with synthetic users over 50,000
computer simulation episodes demonstrated the first successful implementation
of the proposed closed-loop human-in-the-loop paradigm, outperforming the SoTA
shared autonomy algorithms. Following a zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, ARAS
was evaluated on 23 human subjects, demonstrating high accuracy in dynamic
intent detection and smooth, stable 3D trajectory control for dexterous
pick-and-place tasks. ARAS user study achieved a high task success rate of
92.88%, with short completion times comparable to those of SoTA invasive
assistive technologies.

Method: 方法包括微调BERT模型，使用四种数据集（ELLs、非ELLs、不平衡混合数据集、平衡混合数据集），分析21个评估项目，计算评分准确性和平均分数差距（MSG）。

Result: 结果显示，训练数据量大时（ELL=30,000或1,000）无明显偏见，但样本量小（ELL=200）时可能存在偏见。

Conclusion: 结论是训练数据量足够大时可避免评分偏见，但需注意小样本量可能带来的问题。

Abstract: This study investigated potential scoring biases and disparities toward
English Language Learners (ELLs) when using automatic scoring systems for
middle school students' written responses to science assessments. We
specifically focus on examining how unbalanced training data with ELLs
contributes to scoring bias and disparities. We fine-tuned BERT with four
datasets: responses from (1) ELLs, (2) non-ELLs, (3) a mixed dataset reflecting
the real-world proportion of ELLs and non-ELLs (unbalanced), and (4) a balanced
mixed dataset with equal representation of both groups. The study analyzed 21
assessment items: 10 items with about 30,000 ELL responses, five items with
about 1,000 ELL responses, and six items with about 200 ELL responses. Scoring
accuracy (Acc) was calculated and compared to identify bias using Friedman
tests. We measured the Mean Score Gaps (MSGs) between ELLs and non-ELLs and
then calculated the differences in MSGs generated through both the human and AI
models to identify the scoring disparities. We found that no AI bias and
distorted disparities between ELLs and non-ELLs were found when the training
dataset was large enough (ELL = 30,000 and ELL = 1,000), but concerns could
exist if the sample size is limited (ELL = 200).

Abstract: Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a
persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed
diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and
accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We
evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods
evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and
communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized
quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis
using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that
general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and
affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication
accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential
harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and
trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific
knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need
for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in
mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study
provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering
critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing
future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架MediPhi，用于将小型语言模型（SLMs）适应临床任务，通过预指令调优、模型合并和任务对齐，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在临床部署中的高计算成本和延迟问题，以及小型语言模型在生物医学领域适应中的挑战。

Method: 采用预指令调优、模型合并和临床任务对齐的框架，开发了3.8B参数的MediPhi模型，并扩展了CLUE+基准测试。

Result: MediPhi在多个临床任务上显著优于基础模型和GPT-4，例如在医疗实体识别上提升64.3%。

Conclusion: MediPhi框架为临床任务提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，并通过合成数据集MediFlow进一步优化性能。

Abstract: High computation costs and latency of large language models such as GPT-4
have limited their deployment in clinical settings. Small language models
(SLMs) offer a cost-effective alternative, but their limited capacity requires
biomedical domain adaptation, which remains challenging. An additional
bottleneck is the unavailability and high sensitivity of clinical data. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for adapting SLMs into
high-performing clinical models. We introduce the MediPhi collection of
3.8B-parameter SLMs developed with our novel framework: pre-instruction tuning
of experts on relevant medical and clinical corpora (PMC, Medical Guideline,
MedWiki, etc.), model merging, and clinical-tasks alignment. To cover most
clinical tasks, we extended the CLUE benchmark to CLUE+, doubling its size. Our
expert models deliver relative improvements on this benchmark over the base
model without any task-specific fine-tuning: 64.3% on medical entities, 49.5%
on radiology reports, and 44% on ICD-10 coding (outperforming GPT-4-0125 by
14%). We unify the expert models into MediPhi via model merging, preserving
gains across benchmarks. Furthermore, we built the MediFlow collection, a
synthetic dataset of 2.5 million high-quality instructions on 14 medical NLP
tasks, 98 fine-grained document types, and JSON format support. Alignment of
MediPhi using supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization
achieves further gains of 18.9% on average.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过结合人类生成的特征规范和大型语言模型（LLMs）的响应，创建了AI增强的特征规范数据集NOVA，显著提升了特征密度和概念重叠，并在预测人类语义相似性判断方面优于纯人类数据集和词嵌入模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义特征规范方法在概念/特征覆盖范围和质量验证之间存在权衡，因为规范研究需要大量人工劳动。

Method: 通过将人类生成的特征规范与LLMs的响应结合，并验证规范质量，构建了NOVA数据集。

Result: NOVA数据集在特征密度和概念重叠方面表现更优，且在预测人类语义相似性判断上优于纯人类数据集和词嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 人类概念知识比以往规范数据集所捕获的更丰富，经过适当验证的LLMs可作为认知科学研究的强大工具。

Abstract: Semantic feature norms have been foundational in the study of human
conceptual knowledge, yet traditional methods face trade-offs between
concept/feature coverage and verifiability of quality due to the
labor-intensive nature of norming studies. Here, we introduce a novel approach
that augments a dataset of human-generated feature norms with responses from
large language models (LLMs) while verifying the quality of norms against
reliable human judgments. We find that our AI-enhanced feature norm dataset,
NOVA: Norms Optimized Via AI, shows much higher feature density and overlap
among concepts while outperforming a comparable human-only norm dataset and
word-embedding models in predicting people's semantic similarity judgments.
Taken together, we demonstrate that human conceptual knowledge is richer than
captured in previous norm datasets and show that, with proper validation, LLMs
can serve as powerful tools for cognitive science research.

Conclusion: 基础模型选择对奖励建模至关重要，结合基准测试可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and, at its core, reward
modeling have become a crucial part of training powerful large language models
(LLMs). One commonly overlooked factor in training high-quality reward models
(RMs) is the effect of the base model, which is becoming more challenging to
choose given the rapidly growing pool of LLMs. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of the effect of base model selection on reward modeling
performance. Our results show that the performance can be improved by up to 14%
compared to the most common (i.e., default) choice. Moreover, we showcase the
strong statistical relation between some existing benchmarks and downstream
performances. We also demonstrate that the results from a small set of
benchmarks could be combined to boost the model selection ($+$18% on average in
the top 5-10). Lastly, we illustrate the impact of different post-training
steps on the final performance and explore using estimated data distributions
to reduce performance prediction error.

Abstract: This study investigates the challenges of translating low-resource languages
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Various model configurations were tested on Hakka translations, with
BLEU scores ranging from 12% (dictionary-only) to 31% (RAG with Gemini 2.0).
The best-performing model (Model 4) combined retrieval and advanced language
modeling, improving lexical coverage, particularly for specialized or
culturally nuanced terms, and enhancing grammatical coherence. A two-stage
method (Model 3) using dictionary outputs refined by Gemini 2.0 achieved a BLEU
score of 26%, highlighting iterative correction's value and the challenges of
domain-specific expressions. Static dictionary-based approaches struggled with
context-sensitive content, demonstrating the limitations of relying solely on
predefined resources. These results emphasize the need for curated resources,
domain knowledge, and ethical collaboration with local communities, offering a
framework that improves translation accuracy and fluency while supporting
cultural preservation.

Result: 在五个主流数学基准测试中，AutoThink在准确性和效率上优于现有方法，显著减少计算开销。

Conclusion: AutoThink为大型推理模型提供了一种可扩展的自适应推理范式，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are proficient at generating explicit,
step-by-step reasoning sequences before producing final answers. However, such
detailed reasoning can introduce substantial computational overhead and
latency, particularly for simple problems. To address this over-thinking
problem, we explore how to equip LRMs with adaptive thinking capabilities:
enabling them to dynamically decide whether or not to engage in explicit
reasoning based on problem complexity. Building on R1-style distilled models,
we observe that inserting a simple ellipsis ("...") into the prompt can
stochastically trigger either a thinking or no-thinking mode, revealing a
latent controllability in the reasoning behavior. Leveraging this property, we
propose AutoThink, a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that
progressively optimizes reasoning policies via stage-wise reward shaping.
AutoThink learns to invoke explicit reasoning only when necessary, while
defaulting to succinct responses for simpler tasks. Experiments on five
mainstream mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoThink achieves
favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to recent prompting and
RL-based pruning methods. It can be seamlessly integrated into any R1-style
model, including both distilled and further fine-tuned variants. Notably,
AutoThink improves relative accuracy by 6.4 percent while reducing token usage
by 52 percent on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, establishing a scalable and
adaptive reasoning paradigm for LRMs.

Result: 实验证明SIAR和R³在多种设置下有效且通用。

Conclusion: SIAR和R³显著提升了规则检索的准确性和推理性能。

Abstract: This paper systematically addresses the challenges of rule retrieval, a
crucial yet underexplored area. Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense
retrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream
reasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a
significant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the
abstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal
retrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval
(SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce
potential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by
abstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These
induced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval
effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$), a
method that re-estimates the relevance of retrieved rules by assessing whether
the abstract knowledge they contain can be instantiated to align with the facts
in the queries and the helpfulness for reasoning. Extensive experiments across
various settings demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed
methods.

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from
basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate
human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the
emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously
performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile
apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel
safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the
added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal
inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a
systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We
conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four
research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety
analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs;
\textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive
strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets,
and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs.
Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a
structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers
practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure
Computer-Using Agents.

Method: 引入OmniThought数据集，包含200万条CoT过程，标注RV和CD分数，并建立自给自足的管道进行数据整理。

Result: 实验表明，RV和CD分数对LRM训练效果有积极影响，并训练出高性能的LRM。

Conclusion: OmniThought显著提升了LRM在复杂任务中的开发和训练能力。

Abstract: The emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing by excelling in complex tasks such as mathematical
problem-solving and code generation. These models leverage chain-of-thought
(CoT) processes, enabling them to emulate human-like reasoning strategies.
However, the advancement of LRMs is hindered by the lack of comprehensive CoT
datasets. Current resources often fail to provide extensive reasoning problems
with coherent CoT processes distilled from multiple teacher models and do not
account for multifaceted properties describing the internal characteristics of
CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniThought, a large-scale
dataset featuring 2 million CoT processes generated and validated by two
powerful LRMs as teacher models. Each CoT process in OmniThought is annotated
with novel Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) scores, which
describe the appropriateness of CoT verbosity and cognitive difficulty level
for models to comprehend these reasoning processes. We further establish a
self-reliant pipeline to curate this dataset. Extensive experiments using
Qwen2.5 models of various sizes demonstrate the positive impact of our proposed
scores on LRM training effectiveness. Based on the proposed OmniThought
dataset, we further train and release a series of high-performing LRMs,
specifically equipped with stronger reasoning abilities and optimal CoT output
length and difficulty level. Our contributions significantly enhance the
development and training of LRMs for solving complex tasks.

Result: 多模态方法显著优于单模态，但生成模型在精度上落后于监督方法和指令调优模型，但在处理社交媒体特有问题（如leet speak）上表现更好。

Conclusion: 多模态方法在事件检测中更有效，生成模型虽能处理特殊问题，但需改进精度和事件分类能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenges of detecting events on social media,
where traditional unimodal systems struggle due to the rapid and multimodal
nature of data dissemination. We employ a range of models, including unimodal
ModernBERT and ConvNeXt-V2, multimodal fusion techniques, and advanced
generative models like GPT-4o, and LLaVA. Additionally, we also study the
effect of providing multimodal generative models (such as GPT-4o) with a single
modality to assess their efficacy. Our results indicate that while multimodal
approaches notably outperform unimodal counterparts, generative approaches
despite having a large number of parameters, lag behind supervised methods in
precision. Furthermore, we also found that they lag behind instruction-tuned
models because of their inability to generate event classes correctly. During
our error analysis, we discovered that common social media issues such as leet
speak, text elongation, etc. are effectively handled by generative approaches
but are hard to tackle using supervised approaches.

Method: 构建任务特定的LoRA模块库和通用领域LoRA模块，通过通用知识减法（GenKnowSub）提取任务相关残差模块，结合Arrow路由算法动态选择和组合模块。

Conclusion: GenKnowSub框架有效提升了语言模型的零样本泛化能力，适用于不同语言和模型规模。

Abstract: Large language models often struggle with zero-shot generalization, and
several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet,
we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general
knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular
framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of
task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this
general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual
modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we
call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined
task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm
\citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new
inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard
Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from
diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent
performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide
set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 demonstrate how GenKnowSub
generalizes to weaker LLMs. The complete code and data are available at

Conclusion: SALT不仅提升了跨语言迁移效果，还展示了预训练模型在增强当代大型语言模型功能方面的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly incorporate multilingual
capabilities, fueling the demand to transfer them into target language-specific
models. However, most approaches, which blend the source model's embedding by
replacing the source vocabulary with the target language-specific vocabulary,
may constrain expressive capacity in the target language since the source model
is predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose Semantic
Aware Linear Transfer (SALT), a novel cross-lingual transfer technique that
recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to
transmit the deep representational strengths of PLM-derived embedding to LLMs.
SALT derives unique regression lines based on the similarity in the overlap of
the source and target vocabularies, to handle each non-overlapping token's
embedding space. Our extensive experiments show that SALT significantly
outperforms other transfer methods and achieves lower loss with accelerating
faster convergence during language adaptation. Notably, SALT obtains remarkable
performance in cross-lingual understanding setups compared to other methods.
Furthermore, we highlight the scalable use of PLMs to enhance the functionality
of contemporary LLMs by conducting experiments with varying architectures.

Abstract: Monaural multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging
due to data scarcity and the intrinsic difficulty of recognizing and
attributing words to individual speakers, particularly in overlapping speech.
Recent advances have driven the shift from cascade systems to end-to-end (E2E)
architectures, which reduce error propagation and better exploit the synergy
between speech content and speaker identity. Despite rapid progress in E2E
multi-speaker ASR, the field lacks a comprehensive review of recent
developments. This survey provides a systematic taxonomy of E2E neural
approaches for multi-speaker ASR, highlighting recent advances and comparative
analysis. Specifically, we analyze: (1) architectural paradigms (SIMO vs.~SISO)
for pre-segmented audio, analyzing their distinct characteristics and
trade-offs; (2) recent architectural and algorithmic improvements based on
these two paradigms; (3) extensions to long-form speech, including segmentation
strategy and speaker-consistent hypothesis stitching. Further, we (4) evaluate
and compare methods across standard benchmarks. We conclude with a discussion
of open challenges and future research directions towards building robust and
scalable multi-speaker ASR.

Conclusion: 研究推进了对ICL的理解，为模型开发者提供了改进方向，并为AI安全实践提供了更明智的指导依据。

Abstract: Large-scale Transformer language models (LMs) trained solely on next-token
prediction with web-scale data can solve a wide range of tasks after seeing
just a few examples. The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context
learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies
argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while
others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development
in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel
method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling
suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount
of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks
and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's
subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere "memorization" of the
training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent
symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including
the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of
mechanistic interpretability. Overall, our work advances the understanding of
ICL and its implications, offering model developers insights into potential
improvements and providing AI security practitioners with a basis for more
informed guidelines.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI is
hindered by their reliance on single-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data,
which limits contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for
generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and
quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel
framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative
"Ask-Respond-Review" process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple
Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by
incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty.
We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the
LLaMA2-13B model. Evaluations on MT-Bench, MMLU-Pro, and Auto-Arena demonstrate
significant improvements, achieving absolute gains of 2.9\% on MMLU-Pro and 2\%
on MT-Bench compared to prior state-of-the-art models based on LLaMA2-13B.
Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the Review stage and the use of
multiple Reviewers in boosting instruction diversity and difficulty. Our work
highlights the potential of review-driven, multi-agent frameworks for
generating high-quality conversational data at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在俄语代码注释生成上表现不佳，StRuCom填补了这一空白。

Method: 结合俄语GitHub仓库的人工注释和合成生成的注释，并通过自动化验证确保符合多种编程语言标准。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Coder模型上微调后，chrf++和BERTScore指标显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: StRuCom为俄语代码注释生成提供了高质量数据集，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Structured code comments in docstring format are essential for code
comprehension and maintenance, but existing machine learning models for their
generation perform poorly for Russian compared to English. To bridge this gap,
we present StRuCom - the first large-scale dataset (153K examples) specifically
designed for Russian code documentation. Unlike machine-translated English
datasets that distort terminology (e.g., technical loanwords vs. literal
translations) and docstring structures, StRuCom combines human-written comments
from Russian GitHub repositories with synthetically generated ones, ensuring
compliance with Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Go standards through
automated validation. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Coder models (0.5B-7B) on StRuCom
shows statistically significant improvements of chrf++ and BERTScore over
baseline models.

Conclusion: 基于字符串匹配的指标是奖励模型的有效廉价替代品，适用于对齐任务。

Abstract: Reward models are central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but they
are costly to train, requiring large-scale human-labeled preference data and
powerful pretrained LLM backbones. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of
high-quality synthetic instruction-following datasets raises the question: can
simpler, reference-based metrics serve as viable alternatives to reward models
during RL-based alignment? In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic
string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement
with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this
insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging
instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using
BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained
models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across
four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base
language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of
BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models.
Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded
than competing methods. Overall, we show that given access to high-quality
reference outputs (easily obtained via existing instruction-following datasets
or synthetic data generation), string matching-based metrics are cheap yet
effective proxies for reward models during alignment. We release our code and
data at https://github.com/lilakk/BLEUBERI.

Result: 小模型在单次运行中事实准确性显著提升，增加计算资源可进一步提高2-8%。

Conclusion: 推理链长度和计算资源对提升开放域问答任务的事实准确性有效，相关实验数据已公开。

Abstract: Recent studies on large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities have
demonstrated promising improvements in model performance by leveraging a
lengthy thinking process and additional computational resources during
inference, primarily in tasks involving mathematical reasoning (Muennighoff et
al., 2025). However, it remains uncertain if longer reasoning chains inherently
enhance factual accuracy, particularly beyond mathematical contexts. In this
work, we thoroughly examine LLM reasoning within complex open-domain
question-answering (QA) scenarios. We initially distill reasoning traces from
advanced, large-scale reasoning models (QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1-671B), then
fine-tune a variety of models ranging from smaller, instruction-tuned variants
to larger architectures based on Qwen2.5. To enrich reasoning traces, we
introduce factual information from knowledge graphs in the form of paths into
our reasoning traces. Our experimental setup includes four baseline approaches
and six different instruction-tuned models evaluated across a benchmark of six
datasets, encompassing over 22.6K questions. Overall, we carry out 168
experimental runs and analyze approximately 1.7 million reasoning traces. Our
findings indicate that, within a single run, smaller reasoning models achieve
noticeable improvements in factual accuracy compared to their original
instruction-tuned counterparts. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that adding
test-time compute and token budgets factual accuracy consistently improves by
2-8%, further confirming the effectiveness of test-time scaling for enhancing
performance and consequently improving reasoning accuracy in open-domain QA
tasks. We release all the experimental artifacts for further research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文利用上存在数据质量、训练效率和优化目标不足的问题。

Method: SoLoPO将长上下文偏好优化分解为短上下文偏好优化和短到长奖励对齐两部分。

Result: 实验表明SoLoPO提升了主流偏好优化算法的长度和领域泛化能力，同时提高了计算和内存效率。

Conclusion: SoLoPO有效解决了长上下文对齐问题，并显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in pretraining with extended context lengths, large language
models (LLMs) still face challenges in effectively utilizing real-world
long-context information, primarily due to insufficient long-context alignment
caused by data quality issues, training inefficiencies, and the lack of
well-designed optimization objectives. To address these limitations, we propose
a framework named $\textbf{S}$h$\textbf{o}$rt-to-$\textbf{Lo}$ng
$\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{SoLoPO}$), decoupling
long-context preference optimization (PO) into two components: short-context PO
and short-to-long reward alignment (SoLo-RA), supported by both theoretical and
empirical evidence. Specifically, short-context PO leverages preference pairs
sampled from short contexts to enhance the model's contextual knowledge
utilization ability. Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score
consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and
long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This
facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into
long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference
optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data
construction and training processes. Experimental results show that SoLoPO
enhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain
generalization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while
achieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究推进了对Abugida语言序列预测的理解，并为相关应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: This paper explores syllable sequence prediction in Abugida languages using
Transformer-based models, focusing on six languages: Bengali, Hindi, Khmer,
Lao, Myanmar, and Thai, from the Asian Language Treebank (ALT) dataset. We
investigate the reconstruction of complete syllable sequences from various
incomplete input types, including consonant sequences, vowel sequences, partial
syllables (with random character deletions), and masked syllables (with fixed
syllable deletions). Our experiments reveal that consonant sequences play a
critical role in accurate syllable prediction, achieving high BLEU scores,
while vowel sequences present a significantly greater challenge. The model
demonstrates robust performance across tasks, particularly in handling partial
and masked syllable reconstruction, with strong results for tasks involving
consonant information and syllable masking. This study advances the
understanding of sequence prediction for Abugida languages and provides
practical insights for applications such as text prediction, spelling
correction, and data augmentation in these scripts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的知识储备有限，现有检索方法常引入无关或噪声信息，影响推理准确性。

Result: 在单跳和多跳QA基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂推理场景中。

Conclusion: AutoRefine通过高质量搜索和证据合成，显著提升推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but
are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented
reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external
resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information,
hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a
reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new
``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit
knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model
to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an
answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards
alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization.
Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that
AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in
complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine
issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

Motivation: 研究无位置编码的Transformer在平均硬注意力机制下的表达能力，揭示其与传统模型的差异及局限性。

Method: 通过理论分析，将NoPE-AHAT的表达能力与半代数集对应，并探讨其计数能力。

Result: NoPE-AHAT能表达非负整数解的多变量多项式方程语言，但无法表达简单的PARITY问题，且分析问题不可判定。

Conclusion: NoPE-transformers在平均硬注意力下具有复杂表达能力，但存在局限性，且分析难度高。

Abstract: Positional Encodings (PEs) seem to be indispensable for ensuring
expressiveness of transformers; without them attention transformers reduce to a
bag-of-word model. NoPE-transformers (i.e. with No PEs) with unique hard
attention mechanisms were very recently shown to only be able to express
regular languages, i.e., with limited counting ability. This paper shows that,
with average hard attention mechanisms, NoPE-transformers are still
surprisingly expressive: they can express counting languages corresponding to
nonnegative integer solutions to multivariate polynomial equations (i.e.
Diophantine equations), reasoning about which is well-known to be undecidable.
In fact, we provide a precise characterization of languages expressible by
Average Hard Attention NoPE-Transformers (NoPE-AHATs): they correspond
precisely to what we call \emph{semi-algebraic sets}, i.e., finite unions of
sets of nonnegative integer solutions to systems of multivariate polynomial
inequations. We obtain several interesting consequences of our
characterization. Firstly, NoPE-transformers can express counting properties
that are far more complex than established models like simplified counter
machines and Petri nets, but cannot express a very simple counting property of
PARITY. Secondly, the problem of analyzing NoPE-transformers is undecidable,
e.g., whether a given NoPE transformer classifies all input strings in one
class. To complement our results, we exhibit a counting language that is not
expressible by average hard attention transformers even with arbitrary PEs but
is expressible in the circuit complexity class TC$^0$, answering an open
problem.

TL;DR: HAPO通过历史感知策略优化，结合历史信息和奖励机制，显著减少LLM输出长度，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在测试时扩展长度时无法利用历史信息的问题，以实现更简洁且高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HAPO方法，记录历史状态并设计长度奖励函数，结合正确性奖励联合优化。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，HAPO将输出长度减少33-59%，准确性仅下降2-5%。

Conclusion: HAPO有效提升了LLM的简洁推理能力，平衡了长度和准确性。

Abstract: While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly
improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models
(LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior
approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget
constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical
information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We
hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more
concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy
Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum
length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO
employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to
incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those
previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing
shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards
more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness
reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to
train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and
Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span
various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively
induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of
33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.

Method: 引入GODBench基准，整合视频和文本模态；提出RoT框架，模拟物理中波的传播模式，增强MLLMs的创造力。

Result: 实验表明现有MLLMs和CoT在创意评论生成上仍有挑战，而RoT显著提升了创意表达能力。

Conclusion: RoT为MLLMs的创意生成提供了有效方法，GODBench基准推动了该领域的系统性评估。

Abstract: Video Comment Art enhances user engagement by providing creative content that
conveys humor, satire, or emotional resonance, requiring a nuanced and
comprehensive grasp of cultural and contextual subtleties. Although Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated
strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they
still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and
insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their
limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of
comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these
limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and
text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment
Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we
propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to
enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing
MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and
generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective
approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive
meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity. GODBench is publicly

Method: 使用PubMedBERT分类器将11个生物医学QA基准分为推理和知识两类，评估不同模型表现，并训练BioMed-R1模型。

Result: 仅32.8%问题需复杂推理；生物医学模型在对抗测试中表现较差，通用模型更稳健；BioMed-R1在推理任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: BioMed-R1通过针对性训练在推理任务中表现优异，未来可通过结合临床案例和对抗训练进一步提升。

Abstract: Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians'
diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and
PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating
11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using
a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human
performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require
complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1)
and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent
gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5
on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are
misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply,
while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address
this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly
sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports
and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.

high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000

achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This
represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously
best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization
remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the
performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables
improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present
a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional
correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative
to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce
a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO,
achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3
baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including
Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to the
development of highly sophisticated language models for text generation. In
parallel, neuroscience has increasingly employed these models to explore
cognitive processes involved in language comprehension. Previous research has
shown that models such as N-grams and LSTM networks can partially account for
predictability effects in explaining eye movement behaviors, specifically Gaze
Duration, during reading. In this study, we extend these findings by evaluating
transformer-based models (GPT2, LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA2-7B) to further investigate
this relationship. Our results indicate that these architectures outperform
earlier models in explaining the variance in Gaze Durations recorded from
Rioplantense Spanish readers. However, similar to previous studies, these
models still fail to account for the entirety of the variance captured by human
predictability. These findings suggest that, despite their advancements,
state-of-the-art language models continue to predict language in ways that
differ from human readers.

### [345] [Textured mesh Quality Assessment using Geometry and Color Field Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10824)
*Kaifa Yang,Qi Yang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点的新型纹理网格质量评估方法FMQM，利用几何和颜色场提取视觉感知特征，性能优于现有方法且计算复杂度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有纹理网格质量评估方法在准确性和鲁棒性上表现不足，而场表示在3D几何和颜色信息描述中表现出色。

Method: FMQM利用有符号距离场和新提出的最近表面点颜色场提取四种视觉感知特征：几何相似性、几何梯度相似性、空间颜色分布相似性和空间颜色梯度相似性。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，FMQM优于现有方法，且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: FMQM是一种高效实用的纹理网格质量评估方法，适用于3D图形和可视化应用。

Abstract: Textured mesh quality assessment (TMQA) is critical for various 3D mesh
applications. However, existing TMQA methods often struggle to provide accurate
and robust evaluations. Motivated by the effectiveness of fields in
representing both 3D geometry and color information, we propose a novel
point-based TMQA method called field mesh quality metric (FMQM). FMQM utilizes
signed distance fields and a newly proposed color field named nearest surface
point color field to realize effective mesh feature description. Four features
related to visual perception are extracted from the geometry and color fields:
geometry similarity, geometry gradient similarity, space color distribution
similarity, and space color gradient similarity. Experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FMQM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
TMQA metrics. Furthermore, FMQM exhibits low computational complexity, making
it a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications in 3D
graphics and visualization. Our code is publicly available at:

*Alistair Carson,Alec Wright,Stefan Bilbao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过师生微调方法减少神经网络模型中频率混叠的技术，显著抑制了LSTM和TCN中的混叠现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在吉他失真效果建模中广泛应用，但在高频高增益输入下容易产生频率混叠问题。

Method: 采用师生微调方法，教师模型为预训练且参数冻结的模型，学生模型为可学习的副本，通过无混叠数据集进行微调。

Result: 该方法显著减少了LSTM和TCN中的混叠现象，效果优于两倍过采样。

Conclusion: 该方法在抑制混叠的同时，对谐波失真有一定影响，LSTM模型在抗混叠和保持模拟设备感知相似性方面表现最佳。

Abstract: Neural networks have become ubiquitous with guitar distortion effects
modelling in recent years. Despite their ability to yield perceptually
convincing models, they are susceptible to frequency aliasing when driven by
high frequency and high gain inputs. Nonlinear activation functions create both
the desired harmonic distortion and unwanted aliasing distortion as the
bandwidth of the signal is expanded beyond the Nyquist frequency. Here, we
present a method for reducing aliasing in neural models via a teacher-student
fine tuning approach, where the teacher is a pre-trained model with its weights
frozen, and the student is a copy of this with learnable parameters. The
student is fine-tuned against an aliasing-free dataset generated by passing
sinusoids through the original model and removing non-harmonic components from
the output spectra. Our results show that this method significantly suppresses
aliasing for both long-short-term-memory networks (LSTM) and temporal
convolutional networks (TCN). In the majority of our case studies, the
reduction in aliasing was greater than that achieved by two times oversampling.
One side-effect of the proposed method is that harmonic distortion components
are also affected. This adverse effect was found to be model-dependent, with
the LSTM models giving the best balance between anti-aliasing and preserving
the perceived similarity to an analog reference device.

Abstract: We study the linear convergence of Frank-Wolfe algorithms over product
polytopes. We analyze two condition numbers for the product polytope, namely
the \emph{pyramidal width} and the \emph{vertex-facet distance}, based on the
condition numbers of individual polytope components. As a result, for convex
objectives that are $\mu$-Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz, we show linear convergence
rates quantified in terms of the resulting condition numbers. We apply our
results to the problem of approximately finding a feasible point in a polytope
intersection in high-dimensions, and demonstrate the practical efficiency of
our algorithms through empirical results.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了随机逼近（SA）和随机梯度下降（SGD），提出了新的收敛性充分条件，放宽了对噪声或测量误差的要求，甚至无需有限均值。此外，为零阶SGD提供了收敛条件，仅需两次函数评估，无需梯度计算。

Motivation: 研究SA和SGD的收敛性，放宽传统对噪声或误差的严格假设，扩展其理论适用范围。

Method: 通过新的证明方法，推导出SA和SGD的收敛性充分条件，特别是针对零阶SGD的情况。

Result: 提出了迄今为止最弱的收敛性充分条件，显著扩展了SA和SGD理论的适用性。

Conclusion: 本文的成果为SA和SGD的应用提供了更广泛的适用性，尤其是在噪声或误差条件较宽松的情况下。

Abstract: In this paper, we take a fresh look at stochastic approximation (SA) and
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We derive new sufficient conditions for the
convergence of SA. In particular, the "noise" or measurement error need not
have a finite second moment, and under suitable conditions, not even a finite
mean. By adapting this method of proof, we also derive sufficient conditions
for the convergence of zero-order SGD, wherein the stochastic gradient is
computed using only two function evaluations, and no gradient computations. The
sufficient conditions derived here are the weakest to date, thus leading to a
considerable expansion of the applicability of SA and SGD theory.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在数据集整合中，当结果测量指标不一致时，如何通过不同强度的假设链接这些指标，以评估效率提升和潜在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据整合方法常假设结果测量指标一致，但现实中这一假设常不成立。本文旨在探讨在指标不一致时，整合是否能提升效率，并分析其风险。

Method: 提出三种不同强度的假设链接不一致的结果测量指标，并通过理论和实证分析（如整合XBOT和POAT数据集）评估其效果。

Result: 最强假设下整合可提升渐近效率，但假设错误会导致偏差；较温和假设可能在有限样本中提升效率，但随样本量增加效果减弱。

Conclusion: 整合不一致结果测量指标需谨慎选择假设，以避免偏差并最大化效率，为研究者提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Data integration approaches are increasingly used to enhance the efficiency
and generalizability of studies. However, a key limitation of these methods is
the assumption that outcome measures are identical across datasets -- an
assumption that often does not hold in practice. Consider the following opioid
use disorder (OUD) studies: the XBOT trial and the POAT study, both evaluating
the effect of medications for OUD on withdrawal symptom severity (not the
primary outcome of either trial). While XBOT measures withdrawal severity using
the subjective opiate withdrawal scale, POAT uses the clinical opiate
withdrawal scale. We analyze this realistic yet challenging setting where
outcome measures differ across studies and where neither study records both
types of outcomes. Our paper studies whether and when integrating studies with
disparate outcome measures leads to efficiency gains. We introduce three sets
of assumptions -- with varying degrees of strength -- linking both outcome
measures. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight a cautionary tale:
integration can improve asymptotic efficiency only under the strongest
assumption linking the outcomes. However, misspecification of this assumption
leads to bias. In contrast, a milder assumption may yield finite-sample
efficiency gains, yet these benefits diminish as sample size increases. We
illustrate these trade-offs via a case study integrating the XBOT and POAT
datasets to estimate the comparative effect of two medications for opioid use
disorder on withdrawal symptoms. By systematically varying the assumptions
linking the SOW and COW scales, we show potential efficiency gains and the
risks of bias. Our findings emphasize the need for careful assumption selection
when fusing datasets with differing outcome measures, offering guidance for
researchers navigating this common challenge in modern data integration.

Abstract: Surface information derived from exospheric measurements at planetary bodies
complements surface mapping provided by dedicated imagers, offering critical
insights into surface release processes, interactions within the planetary
environment, space weathering, and planetary evolution. This study explores the
feasibility of deriving Mercury's regolith elemental composition from in-situ
measurements of its neutral exosphere using deep neural networks (DNNs). We
present a supervised feed-forward DNN architecture - a multilayer perceptron
(MLP) - that, starting from exospheric densities and proton precipitation
fluxes, predicts the chemical elements of the surface regolith below. It serves
as an estimator for the surface-exosphere interaction and the processes leading
to exosphere formation. Because the DNN requires a comprehensive exospheric
dataset not available from previous missions, this study uses simulated
exosphere components and simulated drivers. Extensive training and testing
campaigns demonstrate the MLP's ability to accurately predict and reconstruct
surface composition maps from these simulated measurements. Although this
initial version does not aim to reproduce Mercury's actual surface composition,
it provides a proof of concept, showcasing the algorithm's robustness and
capacity for handling complex datasets to create estimators for exospheric
generation models. Moreover, our tests reveal substantial potential for further
development, suggesting that this method could significantly enhance the
analysis of complex surface-exosphere interactions and complement planetary
exosphere models. This work anticipates applying the approach to data from the
BepiColombo mission, specifically the SERENA package, whose nominal phase
begins in 2027.

Method: 采用黑盒优化方法设计天气干预措施，无需梯度信息，并通过两种控制场景（一次性初始值干预和基于模型预测控制的序列干预）进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，贝叶斯优化在高维搜索空间中比其他方法更有效，尤其在降雨减少方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是一种高效的天气干预计算方法，适用于复杂天气控制场景。

Abstract: As climate change increases the threat of weather-related disasters, research
on weather control is gaining importance. The objective of weather control is
to mitigate disaster risks by administering interventions with optimal timing,
location, and intensity. However, the optimization process is highly
challenging due to the vast scale and complexity of weather phenomena, which
introduces two major challenges. First, obtaining accurate gradient information
for optimization is difficult. In addition, numerical weather prediction (NWP)
models demand enormous computational resources, necessitating parameter
optimization with minimal function evaluations. To address these challenges,
this study proposes a method for designing weather interventions based on
black-box optimization, which enables efficient exploration without requiring
gradient information. The proposed method is evaluated in two distinct control
scenarios: one-shot initial value intervention and sequential intervention
based on model predictive control. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is
conducted among four representative black-box optimization methods in terms of
total rainfall reduction. Experimental results show that Bayesian optimization
achieves higher control effectiveness than the others, particularly in
high-dimensional search spaces. These findings suggest that Bayesian
optimization is a highly effective approach for weather intervention
computation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于模式的分层稀疏框架Phi，通过利用脉冲神经网络（SNN）中激活的特定分布模式，显著减少了计算量，并在速度和能效上优于现有SNN加速器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN加速器虽然利用了激活稀疏性，但忽略了二进制激活的独特分布模式。本文旨在通过识别和利用这些模式来进一步优化计算。

Method: 提出Phi框架，包含两级稀疏层次：第一级通过预定义模式表示激活，实现离线预计算；第二级通过稀疏矩阵补充第一级，进一步减少计算。采用k-means模式选择和模式感知微调技术，并设计了专用硬件架构。

Result: Phi在实验中实现了3.45倍的加速和4.93倍的能效提升，优于现有SNN加速器。

Conclusion: Phi框架通过模式分层稀疏性有效优化了SNN计算，展示了算法-硬件协同设计的潜力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention for their energy
efficiency and biological plausibility, utilizing 0-1 activation sparsity
through spike-driven computation. While existing SNN accelerators exploit this
sparsity to skip zero computations, they often overlook the unique distribution
patterns inherent in binary activations. In this work, we observe that
particular patterns exist in spike activations, which we can utilize to reduce
the substantial computation of SNN models. Based on these findings, we propose
a novel \textbf{pattern-based hierarchical sparsity} framework, termed
\textbf{\textit{Phi}}, to optimize computation.
  \textit{Phi} introduces a two-level sparsity hierarchy: Level 1 exhibits
vector-wise sparsity by representing activations with pre-defined patterns,
allowing for offline pre-computation with weights and significantly reducing
most runtime computation. Level 2 features element-wise sparsity by
complementing the Level 1 matrix, using a highly sparse matrix to further
reduce computation while maintaining accuracy. We present an algorithm-hardware
co-design approach. Algorithmically, we employ a k-means-based pattern
selection method to identify representative patterns and introduce a
pattern-aware fine-tuning technique to enhance Level 2 sparsity.
Architecturally, we design \textbf{\textit{Phi}}, a dedicated hardware
architecture that efficiently processes the two levels of \textit{Phi} sparsity
on the fly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{Phi} achieves a
$3.45\times$ speedup and a $4.93\times$ improvement in energy efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators, showcasing the effectiveness of
our framework in optimizing SNN computation.

Abstract: Interaction sparsity is the primary obstacle for recommendation systems.
Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of
groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It
also is found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start
problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this sparsity issue shifts the performance
bottleneck to other areas in the computational pipeline. Those that focus on
enriching sparse representations with connectivity data from other external
sources propose methods that are resource demanding and require careful domain
expert aided addition of this newly introduced data. Others that turn to Large
Language Model (LLM) based recommenders will quickly encounter limitations
surrounding data quality and availability. In this work, we propose LLM-based
Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages
retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and
densify a knowledge graph. IKGR learns latent user-item affinities from an
interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent
connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make
intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation
layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate
that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over
state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal
recommendation datasets.

Conclusion: 通过显式建模用户角色和行为逻辑，TagCF框架有效弥补了传统推荐系统的不足，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Recommender systems filter contents/items valuable to users by inferring
preferences from user features and historical behaviors. Mainstream approaches
follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling
item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics
based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the
modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical
confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the
behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and
learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show
that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient
integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems,
for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, the exploitation of the LLM's
world knowledge and logic inference ability produces a virtual logic graph that
reveals dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, augmenting the
recommendation performance. On the other hand, the user role aligns the user
behavioral logic with the observed user feedback, refining our understanding of
user behaviors. Additionally, we also show that the extracted user-item logic
graph is empirically a general knowledge that can benefit a wide range of
recommendation tasks, and conduct experiments on industrial and several public
datasets as verification.

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing customer intents in AI systems is crucial,
particularly in domains characterized by short utterances and the cold start
problem, where recommender systems must include new products or services
without sufficient real user data. Customer utterances are characterized by
infrequent word co-occurences and high term variability, which poses
significant challenges for traditional methods in specifying distinct user
needs and preparing synthetic queries. To address this, we propose an agentic
LLM framework for topic modeling and synthetic query generation, which
accelerates the discovery and recognition of customer intents. We first apply
hierarchical topic modeling and intent discovery to expand a human-curated
taxonomy from 36 generic user intents to 278 granular intents, demonstrating
the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance topic specificity and diversity.
Next, to support newly discovered intents and address the cold start problem,
we generate synthetic user query data, which augments real utterances and
reduces dependency on human annotation, especially in low-resource settings.
Topic model experiments show substantial improvements in coherence and
relevance after topic expansion, while synthetic data experiments indicate that
in-class few-shot prompting significantly improves the quality and utility of
synthetic queries without compromising diversity. We also show that
LLM-generated intent descriptions and keywords can effectively substitute for
human-curated versions when used as context for synthetic query generation. Our
research underscores the scalability and utility of LLM agents in topic
modeling and highlights the strategic use of synthetic utterances to enhance
dataset variability and coverage for intent recognition. We present a
comprehensive and robust framework for online discovery and recognition of new
customer intents in dynamic domains.

Motivation: 提高音乐推荐系统的解释性和用户参与度，通过分析用户长期音乐习惯实现个性化推荐。

Method: 收集用户15年的Last.fm播放记录，构建用户时间上下文数据集，结合Last.fm标签和Spotify音频特征，预测并推荐符合用户偏好的音乐。

Result: 成功预测并推荐用户可能喜欢的音乐，初步研究聚焦于舞蹈性特征，框架可扩展至更多音频特征和用户。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效学习用户音乐习惯，具有扩展性，适用于个性化音乐推荐。

Abstract: This work presents a user-centric recommendation framework, designed as a
pipeline with four distinct, connected, and customizable phases. These phases
are intended to improve explainability and boost user engagement.
  We have collected the historical Last.fm track playback records of a single
user over approximately 15 years. The collected dataset includes more than
90,000 playbacks and approximately 14,000 unique tracks.
  From track playback records, we have created a dataset of user temporal
contexts (each row is a specific moment when the user listened to certain music
descriptors). As music descriptors, we have used community-contributed Last.fm
tags and Spotify audio features. They represent the music that, throughout
years, the user has been listening to.
  Next, given the most relevant Last.fm tags of a moment (e.g. the hour of the
day), we predict the Spotify audio features that best fit the user preferences
in that particular moment. Finally, we use the predicted audio features to find
tracks similar to these features. The final aim is to recommend (and discover)
tracks that the user may feel like listening to at a particular moment.
  For our initial study case, we have chosen to predict only a single audio
feature target: danceability. The framework, however, allows to include more
target variables.
  The ability to learn the musical habits from a single user can be quite
powerful, and this framework could be extended to other users.

Motivation: 权重衰减在CF模型训练中至关重要，但其作用机制未被充分理解，论文旨在揭示其功能并提出替代方案。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，发现权重衰减的作用是编码流行度信息，并提出PRISM方法预编码流行度信息。

Result: PRISM性能提升4.77%，训练时间减少38.48%，并能有效缓解流行度偏差。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种简单高效的CF训练方法，通过预编码流行度信息替代权重衰减，显著提升性能并减少训练时间。

Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) enables large-scale recommendation systems by
encoding information from historical user-item interactions into dense
ID-embedding tables. However, as embedding tables grow, closed-form solutions
become impractical, often necessitating the use of mini-batch gradient descent
for training. Despite extensive work on designing loss functions to train CF
models, we argue that one core component of these pipelines is heavily
overlooked: weight decay. Attaining high-performing models typically requires
careful tuning of weight decay, regardless of loss, yet its necessity is not
well understood. In this work, we question why weight decay is crucial in CF
pipelines and how it impacts training. Through theoretical and empirical
analysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to
encode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors.
Moreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to
influence preference towards popular or unpopular items. Based on these
findings, we propose PRISM (Popularity-awaRe Initialization Strategy for
embedding Magnitudes), a straightforward yet effective solution to simplify the
training of high-performing CF models. PRISM pre-encodes the popularity
information typically learned through weight decay, eliminating its necessity.
Our experiments show that PRISM improves performance by up to 4.77% and reduces
training times by 38.48%, compared to state-of-the-art training strategies.
Additionally, we parameterize PRISM to modulate the initialization strength,
offering a cost-effective and meaningful strategy to mitigate popularity bias.

Abstract: Industry-scale recommender systems face a core challenge: representing
entities with high cardinality, such as users or items, using dense embeddings
that must be accessible during both training and inference. However, as
embedding sizes grow, memory constraints make storage and access increasingly
difficult. We describe a lightweight, learnable embedding compression technique
that projects dense embeddings into a high-dimensional, sparsely activated
space. Designed for retrieval tasks, our method reduces memory requirements
while preserving retrieval performance, enabling scalable deployment under
strict resource constraints. Our results demonstrate that leveraging sparsity
is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of large-scale
recommenders. We release our code at https://github.com/recombee/CompresSAE.

### [359] [System Identification and Control Using Lyapunov-Based Deep Neural Networks without Persistent Excitation: A Concurrent Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10678)
*Rebecca G. Hart,Omkar Sudhir Patil,Zachary I. Bell,Warren E. Dixon*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于DNN的控制器，首次实现了轨迹跟踪和在线系统识别的同步完成，无需持续激励。通过新的并行学习适应律，DNN权重收敛到理想值附近，同时跟踪误差和观测误差也收敛到原点附近。仿真结果显示，函数逼近性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNN控制方法多关注跟踪误差收敛，而忽视了利用DNN识别系统动态的挑战。本文旨在同时解决轨迹跟踪和系统识别问题。

Method: 构建了两种新的并行学习适应律，用于调整DNN各层权重，确保在有限时间激励条件下参数估计收敛。通过Lyapunov稳定性分析验证了误差收敛性。

Result: 仿真表明，在相同初始和操作条件下，函数逼近性能提升40.5%至73.6%，同时保持相似的跟踪误差和控制成本。在轨迹外数据点上，函数逼近性能提升58.88%至74.75%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了DNN控制器的轨迹跟踪与系统识别同步优化，显著提升了函数逼近性能，为DNN在控制领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in control applications due
to their powerful function approximation capabilities. However, many existing
formulations focus primarily on tracking error convergence, often neglecting
the challenge of identifying the system dynamics using the DNN. This paper
presents the first result on simultaneous trajectory tracking and online system
identification using a DNN-based controller, without requiring persistent
excitation. Two new concurrent learning adaptation laws are constructed for the
weights of all the layers of the DNN, achieving convergence of the DNN's
parameter estimates to a neighborhood of their ideal values, provided the DNN's
Jacobian satisfies a finite-time excitation condition. A Lyapunov-based
stability analysis is conducted to ensure convergence of the tracking error,
weight estimation errors, and observer errors to a neighborhood of the origin.
Simulations performed on a range of systems and trajectories, with the same
initial and operating conditions, demonstrated 40.5% to 73.6% improvement in
function approximation performance compared to the baseline, while maintaining
a similar tracking error and control effort. Simulations evaluating function
approximation capabilities on data points outside of the trajectory resulted in
58.88% and 74.75% improvement in function approximation compared to the
baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估基准依赖历史回测，可能导致信息泄露和性能高估，无法真实反映LLM在复杂基金投资中的表现。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，直接连接实时股票市场数据（模型预训练截止后的数据），确保无信息泄露的公平评估。

Result: 在实时评估中，即使是顶尖LLM（如DeepSeek-V3和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）也出现净交易亏损，揭示了LLM在主动基金管理中的局限性。

Conclusion: DeepFund为LLM在金融领域的实时评估提供了新工具，揭示了当前LLM在主动基金管理中的实际挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across
financial tasks, including financial report summarization, earnings call
transcript analysis, and asset classification. However, their real-world
effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately
assessed. A fundamental limitation of existing benchmarks for evaluating
LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing,
inadvertently enabling LLMs to "time travel"-leveraging future information
embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information
leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we
introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate
LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture,
DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data
published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free
evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global
institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level
analysis, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and risk
control-reveal significant practical challenges. Notably, even cutting-edge
models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses
within DeepFund real-time evaluation environment, underscoring the present
limitations of LLMs for active fund management. Our code is available at

Result: 证明了该方法在低温和经典/量子混合算法中的有效性，并提供了算法运行时间的保证。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为半定规划问题提供了物理动机，还解释了已有高效算法的性能。

Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list
of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number
or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum
energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a
semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over
the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space.
These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization
communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are
essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by
quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the
aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant
solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is
concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard
(stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these
parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low
temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for
the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent
approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it
can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the
algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum
thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why
algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the
matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient
update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at
solving SDPs.

Conclusion: 新方法显著改进了量子学习算法的泛化误差界限，为量子学习理论提供了更优的工具。

Abstract: This work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum learning by
establishing a new family of upper bounds on the expected generalization error
of quantum learning algorithms, leveraging the framework introduced by Caro et
al. (2024) and a new definition for the expected true loss. Our primary
contribution is the derivation of these bounds in terms of quantum and
classical R\'enyi divergences, utilizing a variational approach for evaluating
quantum R\'enyi divergences, specifically the Petz and a newly introduced
modified sandwich quantum R\'enyi divergence. Analytically and numerically, we
demonstrate the superior performance of the bounds derived using the modified
sandwich quantum R\'enyi divergence compared to those based on the Petz
divergence. Furthermore, we provide probabilistic generalization error bounds
using two distinct techniques: one based on the modified sandwich quantum
R\'enyi divergence and classical R\'enyi divergence, and another employing
smooth max R\'enyi divergence.

Result: 人类在与LLMs对战时选择更低数字，尤其是零纳什均衡选择增加，高策略能力者主导此行为。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类-LLM交互中的行为异质性，对混合系统的机制设计有重要启示。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into our social and economic
interactions, we need to deepen our understanding of how humans respond to LLMs
opponents in strategic settings. We present the results of the first controlled
monetarily-incentivised laboratory experiment looking at differences in human
behaviour in a multi-player p-beauty contest against other humans and LLMs. We
use a within-subject design in order to compare behaviour at the individual
level. We show that, in this environment, human subjects choose significantly
lower numbers when playing against LLMs than humans, which is mainly driven by
the increased prevalence of `zero' Nash-equilibrium choices. This shift is
mainly driven by subjects with high strategic reasoning ability. Subjects who
play the zero Nash-equilibrium choice motivate their strategy by appealing to
perceived LLM's reasoning ability and, unexpectedly, propensity towards
cooperation. Our findings provide foundational insights into the multi-player
human-LLM interaction in simultaneous choice games, uncover heterogeneities in
both subjects' behaviour and beliefs about LLM's play when playing against
them, and suggest important implications for mechanism design in mixed
human-LLM systems.

Abstract: The variety of data in data lakes presents significant challenges for data
analytics, as data scientists must simultaneously analyze multi-modal data,
including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities, they still
remain inadequate for multi-modal data analytics in terms of accuracy,
efficiency, and freshness. First, current natural language (NL) or SQL-like
query languages may struggle to precisely and comprehensively capture users'
analytical intent. Second, relying on a single unified LLM to process diverse
data modalities often leads to substantial inference overhead. Third, data
stored in data lakes may be incomplete or outdated, making it essential to
integrate external open-domain knowledge to generate timely and relevant
analytics results.
  In this paper, we envision a new multi-modal data analytics system.
Specifically, we propose a novel architecture built upon the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), an emerging paradigm that enables LLMs to collaborate with
knowledgeable agents. First, we define a semantic operator hierarchy tailored
for querying multi-modal data in data lakes and develop an AI-agent-powered
NL2Operator translator to bridge user intent and analytical execution. Next, we
introduce an MCP-based execution framework, in which each MCP server hosts
specialized foundation models optimized for specific data modalities. This
design enhances both accuracy and efficiency, while supporting high scalability
through modular deployment. Finally, we propose a updating mechanism by
harnessing the deep research and machine unlearning techniques to refresh the
data lakes and LLM knowledges, with the goal of balancing the data freshness
and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked
car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test
perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over
misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and
audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or
whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine
modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess
leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in
psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including
congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI,
demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying
on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input,
degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we finetune a
state-of-the-art model using a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D
simulations. Even with limited training data, the refined model surpasses
existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal
localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio
structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory
input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.

Method: 使用Nvidia的NeMo日志流水线，评估降噪对日志准确性的影响，比较多种VAD模型，并探索结合ASR的混合VAD方法。

Result: 降噪显著降低了DER，混合VAD模型在教师-学生实验中DER低至17%，全说话人实验中为45%。

Conclusion: 多阶段日志模型和ASR信息集成能有效提升嘈杂教室环境中的说话人日志性能。

Abstract: Speaker diarization, the process of identifying "who spoke when" in audio
recordings, is essential for understanding classroom dynamics. However,
classroom settings present distinct challenges, including poor recording
quality, high levels of background noise, overlapping speech, and the
difficulty of accurately capturing children's voices. This study investigates
the effectiveness of multi-stage diarization models using Nvidia's NeMo
diarization pipeline. We assess the impact of denoising on diarization accuracy
and compare various voice activity detection (VAD) models, including
self-supervised transformer-based frame-wise VAD models. We also explore a
hybrid VAD approach that integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
word-level timestamps with frame-level VAD predictions. We conduct experiments
using two datasets from English speaking classrooms to separate teacher vs.
student speech and to separate all speakers. Our results show that denoising
significantly improves the Diarization Error Rate (DER) by reducing the rate of
missed speech. Additionally, training on both denoised and noisy datasets leads
to substantial performance gains in noisy conditions. The hybrid VAD model
leads to further improvements in speech detection, achieving a DER as low as
17% in teacher-student experiments and 45% in all-speaker experiments. However,
we also identified trade-offs between voice activity detection and speaker
confusion. Overall, our study highlights the effectiveness of multi-stage
diarization models and integrating ASR-based information for enhancing speaker
diarization in noisy classroom environments.

Motivation: 当前TTS系统的评估标准（如MOS）存在主观性和环境不一致性，且现有数据集缺乏多维设计，尤其在中文TTS评估中表现明显。

Method: 提出ATT-Corpus数据集和基于图灵测试的评估协议，通过判断语音是否像人类来简化评估；同时微调Qwen2-Audio-Instruct模型实现自动评估。

Result: ATT能有效区分模型在特定能力维度的表现，Auto-ATT与人工评估高度一致，证明了其快速可靠的评估价值。

Conclusion: ATT-Corpus和Auto-ATT为TTS系统提供了更客观、多维的评估工具，推动了模型开发的效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
text-to-speech (TTS) systems, enhancing control over speech style, naturalness,
and emotional expression, which brings TTS Systems closer to human-level
performance. Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS
System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies,
and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a
multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles,
context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in
Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio
Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired
with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on
complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge
whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and
improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we
also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for
automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively
differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its
multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with
human evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool.

Result: 在MedleyDB数据集上，参数误差降低33%，主观评测表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合先验知识可提升音频效果迁移的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Style Transfer with Inference-Time Optimisation (ST-ITO) is a recent approach
for transferring the applied effects of a reference audio to a raw audio track.
It optimises the effect parameters to minimise the distance between the style
embeddings of the processed audio and the reference. However, this method
treats all possible configurations equally and relies solely on the embedding
space, which can lead to unrealistic or biased results. We address this pitfall
by introducing a Gaussian prior derived from a vocal preset dataset, DiffVox,
over the parameter space. The resulting optimisation is equivalent to
maximum-a-posteriori estimation. Evaluations on vocal effects transfer on the
MedleyDB dataset show significant improvements across metrics compared to
baselines, including a blind audio effects estimator, nearest-neighbour
approaches, and uncalibrated ST-ITO. The proposed calibration reduces parameter
mean squared error by up to 33% and matches the reference style better.
Subjective evaluations with 16 participants confirm our method's superiority,
especially in limited data regimes. This work demonstrates how incorporating
prior knowledge in inference time enhances audio effects transfer, paving the
way for more effective and realistic audio processing systems.

Abstract: For singers of all experience levels, one of the most daunting challenges in
learning technical repertoire is navigating placement and vocal register in and
around the passagio (passage between chest voice and head voice registers).
Particularly in pop music, where a single artist may use a variety of timbre's
and textures to achieve a desired quality, it can be difficult to identify what
vocal register within the vocal range a singer is using. This paper presents
two methods for classifying vocal registers in an audio signal of male pop
music through the analysis of textural features of mel-spectrogram images.
Additionally, we will discuss the practical integration of these models for
vocal analysis tools, and introduce a concurrently developed software called
AVRA which stands for Automatic Vocal Register Analysis. Our proposed methods
achieved consistent classification of vocal register through both Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which
supports the promise of more robust classification possibilities across more
voice types and genres of singing.

Motivation: 现代基于CNN的VSR系统计算成本高，且存在特征冗余问题，但该问题在VSR领域很少被讨论。

Method: 提出使用“Ghost特征”减少冗余，并结合RNN解决梯度消失问题，利用当前帧、下一帧、前一帧输出和隐藏状态进行建模。

Result: 在多个基准模型和数据集上的实验表明，PSNR和SSIM有所提升，视频纹理细节也得到更好保留。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效减少了特征冗余并提升了视频超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Modern video super-resolution (VSR) systems based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) require huge computational costs. The problem of feature
redundancy is present in most models in many domains, but is rarely discussed
in VSR. We experimentally observe that many features in VSR models are also
similar to each other, so we propose to use "Ghost features" to reduce this
redundancy. We also analyze the so-called "gradient disappearance" phenomenon
generated by the conventional recurrent convolutional network (RNN) model, and
combine the Ghost module with RNN to complete the modeling on time series. The
current frame is used as input to the model together with the next frame, the
output of the previous frame and the hidden state. Extensive experiments on
several benchmark models and datasets show that the PSNR and SSIM of our
proposed modality are improved to some extent. Some texture details in the
video are also better preserved.

Abstract: While the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, its long-term
effects persist through Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly known
as Long COVID. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding both its
duration and optimal management strategies. PASC manifests as a diverse array
of persistent or newly emerging symptoms--ranging from fatigue, dyspnea, and
neurologic impairments (e.g., brain fog), to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and
musculoskeletal abnormalities--that extend beyond the acute infection phase.
This heterogeneous presentation poses substantial challenges for clinical
assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning. In this paper, we focus on
imaging findings that may suggest fibrotic damage in the lungs, a critical
manifestation characterized by scarring of lung tissue, which can potentially
affect long-term respiratory function in patients with PASC. This study
introduces a novel multi-center chest CT analysis framework that combines deep
learning and radiomics for fibrosis prediction. Our approach leverages
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and interpretable feature extraction,
achieving 82.2% accuracy and 85.5% AUC in classification tasks. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Grad-CAM visualization and radiomics-based feature
analysis in providing clinically relevant insights for PASC-related lung
fibrosis prediction. Our findings highlight the potential of deep
learning-driven computational methods for early detection and risk assessment
of PASC-related lung fibrosis--presented for the first time in the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的解剖感知切片选择方法，用于高效多器官分割，减少计算负担并保持解剖保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D分割方法计算和内存消耗大，2D方法缺乏跨视图上下文感知，需解决这些问题以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用融合三切片（2.5D）表示和VLM进行跨视图器官存在检测，选择性保留高结构相关性的切片。

Result: 模型在多个器官上显著优于基线方法，实现了高效且空间一致的器官切片过滤。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低下游分割成本，同时保持高解剖保真度，为医学图像分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate multi-organ segmentation from abdominal CT volumes is
a fundamental challenge in medical image analysis. Existing 3D segmentation
approaches are computationally and memory intensive, often processing entire
volumes that contain many anatomically irrelevant slices. Meanwhile, 2D methods
suffer from class imbalance and lack cross-view contextual awareness. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel, anatomically-aware slice
selector pipeline that reduces input volume prior to segmentation. Our unified
framework introduces a vision-language model (VLM) for cross-view organ
presence detection using fused tri-slice (2.5D) representations from axial,
sagittal, and coronal planes. Our proposed model acts as an "expert" in
anatomical localization, reasoning over multi-view representations to
selectively retain slices with high structural relevance. This enables
spatially consistent filtering across orientations while preserving contextual
cues. More importantly, since standard segmentation metrics such as Dice or IoU
fail to measure the spatial precision of such slice selection, we introduce a
novel metric, Slice Localization Concordance (SLC), which jointly captures
anatomical coverage and spatial alignment with organ-centric reference slices.
Unlike segmentation-specific metrics, SLC provides a model-agnostic evaluation
of localization fidelity. Our model offers substantial improvement gains
against several baselines across all organs, demonstrating both accurate and
reliable organ-focused slice filtering. These results show that our method
enables efficient and spatially consistent organ filtering, thereby
significantly reducing downstream segmentation cost while maintaining high
anatomical fidelity.

Motivation: 现有方法无法自动分割海马体亚区，尤其是免疫组化图像，限制了疾病机制和治疗干预的研究。

Method: 提出ROIsGAN，一种基于U-Net的区域引导生成对抗网络，通过结合Dice和二元交叉熵损失优化边界和结构细节。

Conclusion: 该研究为海马体亚区自动分割提供了基础数据集和方法，支持神经科学研究的可扩展和高精度分析。

Abstract: The hippocampus, a critical brain structure involved in memory processing and
various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, comprises three key
subregions: the dentate gyrus (DG), Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and Cornu Ammonis 3
(CA3). Accurate segmentation of these subregions from histological tissue
images is essential for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms,
developmental dynamics, and therapeutic interventions. However, no existing
methods address the automated segmentation of hippocampal subregions from
tissue images, particularly from immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel set of four comprehensive murine hippocampal IHC
datasets featuring distinct staining modalities: cFos, NeuN, and multiplexed
stains combining cFos, NeuN, and either {\Delta}FosB or GAD67, capturing
structural, neuronal activity, and plasticity associated information.
Additionally, we propose ROIsGAN, a region-guided U-Net-based generative
adversarial network tailored for hippocampal subregion segmentation. By
leveraging adversarial learning, ROIsGAN enhances boundary delineation and
structural detail refinement through a novel region-guided discriminator loss
combining Dice and binary cross-entropy loss. Evaluated across DG, CA1, and CA3
subregions, ROIsGAN consistently outperforms conventional segmentation models,
achieving performance gains ranging from 1-10% in Dice score and up to 11% in
Intersection over Union (IoU), particularly under challenging staining
conditions. Our work establishes foundational datasets and methods for
automated hippocampal segmentation, enabling scalable, high-precision analysis
of tissue images in neuroscience research. Our generated datasets, proposed
model as a standalone tool, and its corresponding source code are publicly

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，C2-STi在单切片和多切片ST插值上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: C2-STi为ST分析提供了一种高效且实用的插值解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a promising technique that characterizes the
spatial gene profiling patterns within the tissue context. Comprehensive ST
analysis depends on consecutive slices for 3D spatial insights, whereas the
missing intermediate tissue sections and high costs limit the practical
feasibility of generating multi-slice ST. In this paper, we propose C2-STi, the
first attempt for interpolating missing ST slices at arbitrary intermediate
positions between adjacent ST slices. Despite intuitive, effective ST
interpolation presents significant challenges, including 1) limited continuity
across heterogeneous tissue sections, 2) complex intrinsic correlation across
genes, and 3) intricate cellular structures and biological semantics within
each tissue section. To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a
distance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture
cross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices,
2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale
biological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that
integrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images to filter
and align the essential cellular features across ST and H\&E images. Extensive
experiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over
state-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST
interpolation. Codes are available at

Motivation: AI自动分割在临床应用中可能因训练数据与实际情况差异而性能下降，需改进模型以适应不同成像条件和患者特征。

Method: 通过精炼预训练的Transformer为HTN，使用平衡数据集（CECT和NCCT）训练模型，并在验证集上评估其性能。

Conclusion: HTN模型适用于临床需求，能有效处理不同成像条件和患者特征，且训练数据需求较低。

Abstract: AI automated segmentations for radiation treatment planning (RTP) can
deteriorate when applied in clinical cases with different characteristics than
training dataset. Hence, we refined a pretrained transformer into a hybrid
transformer convolutional network (HTN) to segment cardiac substructures lung
and breast cancer patients acquired with varying imaging contrasts and patient
scan positions. Cohort I, consisting of 56 contrast-enhanced (CECT) and 124
non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans from patients with non-small cell lung cancers
acquired in supine position, was used to create oracle with all 180 training
cases and balanced (CECT: 32, NCCT: 32 training) HTN models. Models were
evaluated on a held-out validation set of 60 cohort I patients and 66 patients
with breast cancer from cohort II acquired in supine (n=45) and prone (n=21)
positions. Accuracy was measured using DSC, HD95, and dose metrics. Publicly
available TotalSegmentator served as the benchmark. The oracle and balanced
models were similarly accurate (DSC Cohort I: 0.80 \pm 0.10 versus 0.81 \pm
0.10; Cohort II: 0.77 \pm 0.13 versus 0.80 \pm 0.12), outperforming
TotalSegmentator. The balanced model, using half the training cases as oracle,
produced similar dose metrics as manual delineations for all cardiac
substructures. This model was robust to CT contrast in 6 out of 8 substructures
and patient scan position variations in 5 out of 8 substructures and showed low
correlations of accuracy to patient size and age. A HTN demonstrated robustly
accurate (geometric and dose metrics) cardiac substructures segmentation from
CTs with varying imaging and patient characteristics, one key requirement for
clinical use. Moreover, the model combining pretraining with balanced
distribution of NCCT and CECT scans was able to provide reliably accurate
segmentations under varied conditions with far fewer labeled datasets compared
to an oracle model.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value
in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high
dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great
challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with
these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for
analysis. In recent years, Diffusion Model, as an emerging generative model,
has shown unique advantages in hyperspectral image processing. By simulating
the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model can effectively
process high-dimensional data, generate high-quality samples, and perform well
in denoising and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research
advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis,
and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing,
noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of
diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are
summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the
accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new
direction for future research.

Abstract: Comprehensive assessment of the various aspects of the brain's microstructure
requires the use of complementary imaging techniques. This includes measuring
the spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers
(myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light
microscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D
orientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been
introduced as a reliable technique providing a resolution in the micrometer
range while allowing processing of series of complete brain sections. 3D-PLI
acquisition is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after
measurement. By post-staining for cell bodies, a direct link between fiber- and
cytoarchitecture can potentially be established within the same section.
However, inevitable distortions introduced during the staining process make a
nonlinear and cross-modal registration necessary in order to study the detailed
relationships between cells and fibers in the images. In addition, the
complexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows
for a limited number of samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep
learning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining
of 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level. In a supervised
setting, we build on a unique dataset of brain sections, to which Cresyl violet
staining has been applied after 3D-PLI measurement. To ensure high
correspondence between both modalities, we address the misalignment of training
data using Fourier-based registration methods. In this way, registration can be
efficiently calculated during training for local image patches of target and
predicted staining. We demonstrate that the proposed method enables prediction
of a Cresyl violet staining from 3D-PLI, matching individual cell instances.

Abstract: Accelerating inverse design of crystalline materials with generative models
has significant implications for a range of technologies. Unlike other atomic
systems, 3D crystals are invariant to discrete groups of isometries called the
space groups. Crucially, these space group symmetries are known to heavily
influence materials properties. We propose SGEquiDiff, a crystal generative
model which naturally handles space group constraints with space group
invariant likelihoods. SGEquiDiff consists of an SE(3)-invariant, telescoping
discrete sampler of crystal lattices; permutation-invariant, transformer-based
autoregressive sampling of Wyckoff positions, elements, and numbers of
symmetrically unique atoms; and space group equivariant diffusion of atomic
coordinates. We show that space group equivariant vector fields automatically
live in the tangent spaces of the Wyckoff positions. SGEquiDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets as assessed by
quantitative proxy metrics and quantum mechanical calculations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式大型语言模型（LLM）推理在GPU上存在高达20%的开销，现有技术通过任务分解和通信重叠尝试缓解，但仍存在细粒度分解和通信占用过多SM的问题。

Method: 提出TokenWeave，采用令牌分割技术将批次令牌分为两个子集并重叠计算与通信，优化层归一化计算顺序，并实现融合的AllReduce-RMSNorm内核。

Result: 实验显示TokenWeave在多个模型和负载下实现高达29%的延迟降低和26%的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: TokenWeave通过创新优化显著提升了分布式LLM推理的性能，甚至优于无通信的等效模型。

Abstract: Distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) can introduce overheads
of up to 20% even over GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects such as
NVLINK. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by
decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication
with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large
computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads.
Further, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs),
adding to the overhead.
  We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a
Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into
two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The computation of one
subset is then overlapped with the communication of the other. In addition,
TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with
respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused
AllReduce-RMSNorm kernel carefully leveraging Multimem instruction support
available on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to
perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel
enables the memory bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's
computation, providing additional gains. Our evaluations demonstrate up to 29%
latency gains and up to 26% throughput gains across multiple models and
workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance
compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.

Abstract: Releasing useful information from datasets with hierarchical structures while
preserving individual privacy presents a significant challenge. Standard
privacy-preserving mechanisms, and in particular Differential Privacy, often
require careful allocation of a finite privacy budget across different levels
and components of the hierarchy. Sub-optimal allocation can lead to either
excessive noise, rendering the data useless, or to insufficient protections for
sensitive information. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimal
privacy budget allocation for hierarchical data release. It formulates this
challenge as a constrained optimization problem, aiming to maximize data
utility subject to a total privacy budget while considering the inherent
trade-offs between data granularity and privacy loss. The proposed approach is
supported by theoretical analysis and validated through comprehensive
experiments on real hierarchical datasets. These experiments demonstrate that
optimal privacy budget allocation significantly enhances the utility of the
released data and improves the performance of downstream tasks.

Result: 减少了SKINNY64/64的11轮积分区分器所需的活跃明文比特数，并发现12轮密钥依赖区分器；还发现7轮和8轮区分器，改进密钥恢复攻击。

Abstract: The study by Gohr et.al at CRYPTO 2019 and sunsequent related works have
shown that neural networks can uncover previously unused features, offering
novel insights into cryptanalysis. Motivated by these findings, we employ
neural networks to learn features specifically related to integral properties
and integrate the corresponding insights into optimized search frameworks.
These findings validate the framework of using neural networks for feature
exploration, providing researchers with novel insights that advance established
cryptanalysis methods.
  Neural networks have inspired the development of more precise integral search
models. By comparing the integral distinguishers obtained via neural networks
with those identified by classical methods, we observe that existing automated
search models often fail to find optimal distinguishers. To address this issue,
we develop a meet in the middle search framework that balances model accuracy
and computational efficiency. As a result, we reduce the number of active
plaintext bits required for an 11 rounds integral distinguisher on SKINNY64/64,
and further identify a 12 rounds key dependent integral distinguisher achieving
one additional round over the previous best-known result.
  The integral distinguishers discovered by neural networks enable key recovery
attacks on more rounds. We identify a 7 rounds key independent integral
distinguisher from neural networks with even only one active plaintext cell,
which is based on linear combinations of bits. This distinguisher enables a 15
rounds key recovery attack on SKINNYn/n, improving upon the previous record by
one round. Additionally, we discover an 8 rounds key dependent integral
distinguisher using neural network that further reduces the time complexity of
key recovery attacks against SKINNY.

Motivation: 现有研究多集中于对抗性恶意软件示例，缺乏对实际安全风险的全面分析，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用CIA原则定义安全风险范围，分解系统为不同阶段并建立分类法，总结技术进展并进行案例研究。

Result: 通过阶段分类法总结了技术进展和攻击与防御的不足，案例研究提供了新的实证见解。

Conclusion: 论文提出了基于阶段分类法的未来研究方向，包括阶段内和阶段间的分析。

Abstract: Malware presents a persistent threat to user privacy and data integrity. To
combat this, machine learning-based (ML-based) malware detection (MD) systems
have been developed. However, these systems have increasingly been attacked in
recent years, undermining their effectiveness in practice. While the security
risks associated with ML-based MD systems have garnered considerable attention,
the majority of prior works is limited to adversarial malware examples, lacking
a comprehensive analysis of practical security risks. This paper addresses this
gap by utilizing the CIA principles to define the scope of security risks. We
then deconstruct ML-based MD systems into distinct operational stages, thus
developing a stage-based taxonomy. Utilizing this taxonomy, we summarize the
technical progress and discuss the gaps in the attack and defense proposals
related to the ML-based MD systems within each stage. Subsequently, we conduct
two case studies, using both inter-stage and intra-stage analyses according to
the stage-based taxonomy to provide new empirical insights. Based on these
analyses and insights, we suggest potential future directions from both
inter-stage and intra-stage perspectives.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DRArmor是一种新型防御机制，通过结合可解释AI和针对性检测策略，有效对抗联邦学习中的数据重构攻击（DRA），保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）虽然能保护数据隐私，但易受数据重构攻击（如LoKI和Robbing the Fed）威胁，需要一种更精准的防御方法。

Method: DRArmor通过分析恶意层对输出的贡献和梯度值不一致性，识别并针对性防御（如噪声注入、像素化和剪枝），而非全模型防御。

Result: 在200客户FL环境中，DRArmor对MNIST等数据集表现优异，真阳性率和真阴性率分别为0.910和0.890，平均准确率87%，数据泄漏率降低62.5%。

Conclusion: DRArmor在保护隐私的同时保持模型性能，优于现有防御机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training while keeping client data decentralized and private. However, it
is vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) such as "LoKI" and "Robbing
the Fed", where malicious models sent from the server to the client can
reconstruct sensitive user data. To counter this, we introduce DRArmor, a novel
defense mechanism that integrates Explainable AI with targeted detection and
mitigation strategies for DRA. Unlike existing defenses that focus on the
entire model, DRArmor identifies and addresses the root cause (i.e., malicious
layers within the model that send gradients with malicious intent) by analyzing
their contribution to the output and detecting inconsistencies in gradient
values. Once these malicious layers are identified, DRArmor applies defense
techniques such as noise injection, pixelation, and pruning to these layers
rather than the whole model, minimizing the attack surface and preserving
client data privacy. We evaluate DRArmor's performance against the advanced
LoKI attack across diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
ImageNet, in a 200-client FL setup. Our results demonstrate DRArmor's
effectiveness in mitigating data leakage, achieving high True Positive and True
Negative Rates of 0.910 and 0.890, respectively. Additionally, DRArmor
maintains an average accuracy of 87%, effectively protecting client privacy
without compromising model performance. Compared to existing defense
mechanisms, DRArmor reduces the data leakage rate by 62.5% with datasets
containing 500 samples per client.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）将改变网络攻击的经济性，使攻击者能够针对个体用户发起定制化攻击，而非传统的广泛攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs如何使网络攻击更高效、个性化，并分析其潜在威胁。

Method: 通过实际案例（如Enron邮件数据集）展示LLMs如何自动发现敏感信息并用于勒索。

Result: LLMs已能实现高度个性化的攻击，尽管部分攻击目前成本较高，但随着技术发展，威胁将加剧。

Conclusion: LLMs的普及需要新的深度防御策略以应对其带来的网络安全挑战。

Abstract: We argue that Large language models (LLMs) will soon alter the economics of
cyberattacks. Instead of attacking the most commonly used software and
monetizing exploits by targeting the lowest common denominator among victims,
LLMs enable adversaries to launch tailored attacks on a user-by-user basis. On
the exploitation front, instead of human attackers manually searching for one
difficult-to-identify bug in a product with millions of users, LLMs can find
thousands of easy-to-identify bugs in products with thousands of users. And on
the monetization front, instead of generic ransomware that always performs the
same attack (encrypt all your data and request payment to decrypt), an
LLM-driven ransomware attack could tailor the ransom demand based on the
particular content of each exploited device.
  We show that these two attacks (and several others) are imminently practical
using state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, we show that without any human
intervention, an LLM finds highly sensitive personal information in the Enron
email dataset (e.g., an executive having an affair with another employee) that
could be used for blackmail. While some of our attacks are still too expensive
to scale widely today, the incentives to implement these attacks will only
increase as LLMs get cheaper. Thus, we argue that LLMs create a need for new
defense-in-depth approaches.

TL;DR: NeoLightning是对Buchla Lightning的现代重新诠释，结合了深度学习手势识别和实时多媒体处理技术，为当代用户提供更直观的交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史乐器（如Buchla Lightning）因技术过时而无法直接交互的问题，使其手势交互功能现代化。

Method: 利用MediaPipe进行深度学习手势识别，结合Max/MSP和Processing实现实时多媒体处理。

Result: 新系统实现了精确、低延迟的手势识别和沉浸式3D交互，扩展了音乐表演和声音设计的可能性。

Conclusion: NeoLightning成功将经典创意与现代技术结合，重新定义了基于手势的音乐交互方式。

Abstract: This paper introduces NeoLightning, a modern reinterpretation of the Buchla
Lightning. NeoLightning preserves the innovative spirit of Don Buchla's "Buchla
Lightning" (introduced in the 1990s) while making its gesture-based interaction
accessible to contemporary users. While the original Buchla Lightning and many
other historical instruments were groundbreaking in their time, they are now
largely unsupported, limiting user interaction to indirect experiences. To
address this, NeoLightning leverages MediaPipe for deep learning-based gesture
recognition and employs Max/MSP and Processing for real-time multimedia
processing. The redesigned system offers precise, low-latency gesture
recognition and immersive 3D interaction. By merging the creative spirit of the
original Lightning with modern advancements, NeoLightning redefines
gesture-based musical interaction, expanding possibilities for expressive
performance and interactive sound design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多元价值观的社交媒体内容排序方法，通过78种价值观库和LLM分类器实现实时重排序，并通过用户研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社交媒体排序算法过于关注用户参与度，忽视了其他重要价值观（如幸福感、建设性讨论等），需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 开发了一个价值观库（78种价值观）和LLM分类器，并实现为浏览器插件Alexandria，用于实时重排序Twitter内容。

Result: 通过定性（N=12）和定量（N=257）用户研究，发现多元价值观库能更好地满足用户需求，提升控制感。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过终端用户工具可以实际部署被批评缺失的价值观，为社交媒体排序算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Social media feed ranking algorithms fail when they too narrowly focus on
engagement as their objective. The literature has asserted a wide variety of
values that these algorithms should account for as well -- ranging from
well-being to productive discourse -- far more than can be encapsulated by a
single topic or theory. In response, we present a $\textit{library of values}$
for social media algorithms: a pluralistic set of 78 values as articulated
across the literature, implemented into LLM-powered content classifiers that
can be installed individually or in combination for real-time re-ranking of
social media feeds. We investigate this approach by developing a browser
extension, $\textit{Alexandria}$, that re-ranks the X/Twitter feed in real time
based on the user's desired values. Through two user studies, both qualitative
(N=12) and quantitative (N=257), we found that diverse user needs require a
large library of values, enabling more nuanced preferences and greater user
control. With this work, we argue that the values criticized as missing from
social media ranking algorithms can be operationalized and deployed today
through end-user tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用用户模型（GUM）架构，通过观察用户与计算机的交互行为，学习用户的知识和偏好，并支持多模态推理，以实现更智能的人机交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用户模型局限于特定应用，缺乏灵活推理能力，无法实现全面理解用户需求的目标。GUM旨在通过多模态观察构建通用用户模型，填补这一空白。

Method: GUM通过输入非结构化用户观察（如设备截图），生成置信度加权的用户知识命题，并支持多模态推理、上下文检索和动态更新。

Result: 实验表明，GUM能准确推断用户需求，并支持主动助手（GUMBOs）发现和执行用户未明确请求的操作。

Conclusion: GUM通过多模态模型理解非结构化上下文，实现了长期以来的HCI愿景，并为新型交互系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human-computer interaction has long imagined technology that understands
us-from our preferences and habits, to the timing and purpose of our everyday
actions. Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to
specific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill
these visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model
(GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your
computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g.,
device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that
capture that user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is
preparing for a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or
recognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft
by observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs
introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from
multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and
continuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of
applications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based
assistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface
important information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences
across apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover
and execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our
evaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about
users, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform
actions that users wouldn't think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs
introduce methods that leverage multimodal models to understand unstructured
context, enabling long-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive
systems that anticipate user needs.

Motivation: 探讨AI协作写作如何影响用户的心理控制点。

Method: 对462名参与者进行实证研究，分析就业状态对AI依赖和控制点的影响。

Result: 就业者更依赖AI且控制点内化，失业者个人能动性降低。

Conclusion: 研究引发关于AI如何塑造个人能动性和身份的讨论。

Abstract: As AI tools increasingly shape how we write, they may also quietly reshape
how we perceive ourselves. This paper explores the psychological impact of
co-writing with AI on people's locus of control. Through an empirical study
with 462 participants, we found that employment status plays a critical role in
shaping users' reliance on AI and their locus of control. Current results
demonstrated that employed participants displayed higher reliance on AI and a
shift toward internal control, while unemployed users tended to experience a
reduction in personal agency. Through quantitative results and qualitative
observations, this study opens a broader conversation about AI's role in
shaping personal agency and identity.

Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在边缘设备上部署时面临的用户行为建模挑战，同时保护用户隐私并减少延迟。

Method: 利用结构化用户画像生成模拟交互会话，通过大型语言模型（LLM）生成多样化的对话数据，并评估小型模型在用户画像重建任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 该数据集为开发隐私保护的智能AI系统提供了重要测试平台，推动了直接在用户设备上学习和适应的技术发展。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to
assess and improve small language models deployable on edge devices, with a
focus on user profiling from multi-session natural language interactions in
smart home environments. At the core of the dataset are structured user
profiles, each defined by a set of routines - context-triggered, repeatable
patterns of behavior that govern how users interact with their home systems.
Using these profiles as input, a large language model (LLM) generates
corresponding interaction sessions that simulate realistic, diverse, and
context-aware dialogues between users and their devices.
  The primary task supported by this dataset is profile reconstruction:
inferring user routines and preferences solely from interactions history. To
assess how well current models can perform this task under realistic
conditions, we benchmarked several state-of-the-art compact language models and
compared their performance against large foundation models. Our results show
that while small models demonstrate some capability in reconstructing profiles,
they still fall significantly short of large models in accurately capturing
user behavior. This performance gap poses a major challenge - particularly
because on-device processing offers critical advantages, such as preserving
user privacy, minimizing latency, and enabling personalized experiences without
reliance on the cloud. By providing a realistic, structured testbed for
developing and evaluating behavioral modeling under these constraints, our
dataset represents a key step toward enabling intelligent, privacy-respecting
AI systems that learn and adapt directly on user-owned devices.
