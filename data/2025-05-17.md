### [1] [Healthy Distrust in AI systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09747)
*Benjamin Paaßen,Suzana Alpsancar,Tobias Matzner,Ingrid Scharlau*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出“健康的不信任”概念，强调在某些AI使用场景中，合理的不信任是建立真正信任的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究强调信任，但忽略了社会背景下AI可能被滥用的情况，需要一种合理的不信任态度来保护人类自主性。

Method: 通过跨学科研究（计算机科学、社会学、心理学等）分析信任与不信任的概念，提出“健康的不信任”框架。

Result: 定义了“健康的不信任”作为AI使用中保护人类自主性的关键组成部分。

Conclusion: 合理的“健康的不信任”是构建真正信任的必要条件，尤其在AI可能被滥用的社会背景下。

Abstract: Under the slogan of trustworthy AI, much of contemporary AI research is
focused on designing AI systems and usage practices that inspire human trust
and, thus, enhance adoption of AI systems. However, a person affected by an AI
system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they,
if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to
believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases,
distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust
in the first place. We propose the term "healthy distrust" to describe such a
justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate
prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history,
psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might
fill and conceptualize healthy distrust as a crucial part for AI usage that
respects human autonomy.

### [2] [Which Demographic Features Are Relevant for Individual Fairness Evaluation of U.S. Recidivism Risk Assessment Tools?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09868)
*Tin Trung Nguyen,Jiannan Xu,Phuong-Anh Nguyen-Le,Jonathan Lazar,Donald Braman,Hal Daumé III,Zubin Jelveh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究通过实验评估了在累犯风险评估工具中，哪些人口特征应纳入个体公平性考量，结论是年龄和性别应被考虑，而种族应被忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管个体公平性在美国宪法中有基础，但其技术标准尚未在州或联邦法规中具体化。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过人类受试者实验，评估哪些人口特征与个体公平性评估相关。

Result: 分析表明，个体相似性函数应考虑年龄和性别，但忽略种族。

Conclusion: 研究为个体公平性在累犯风险评估中的具体实施提供了依据，强调了年龄和性别的重要性，同时排除了种族因素。

Abstract: Despite its U.S. constitutional foundation, the technical ``individual
fairness'' criterion has not been operationalized in state or federal
statutes/regulations. We conduct a human subjects experiment to address this
gap, evaluating which demographic features are relevant for individual fairness
evaluation of recidivism risk assessment (RRA) tools. Our analyses conclude
that the individual similarity function should consider age and sex, but it
should ignore race.

### [3] [To what extent can current French mobile network support agricultural robots?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10044)
*Pierre La Rocca,Gaël Guennebaud,Aurélie Bugeau*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 农业机器人大规模部署的能源消耗和碳足迹评估方法，揭示高数据传输需求对网络基础设施和可管理农田面积的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业机器人应用依赖移动网络数据传输，但其基础设施需求和能源环境后果在数字农业文献中被忽视。

Method: 提出评估农业机器人部署的额外能源消耗和碳足迹的方法，并估算网络基础设施约束下可管理的农田面积。

Result: 高数据传输需求导致显著额外影响，且影响增速超出线性预测；现有网络站点下，高需求会迅速减少可管理农田面积。

Conclusion: 农业机器人部署需综合考虑数据传输需求和网络基础设施限制，以避免不可持续的环境和能源影响。

Abstract: The large-scale integration of robots in agriculture offers many promises for
enhancing sustainability and increasing food production. The numerous
applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile
network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the
robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure
required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and
environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture
literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional
energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of
agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area
that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network
infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France
mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios.
Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant
additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by
classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the
existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing
manageable agricultural area.

### [4] [Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Approaches for Automatic Educational Knowledge Graph Construction in CourseMapper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10069)
*Qurat Ul Ain,Mohamed Amine Chatti,Amr Shakhshir,Jean Qussa,Rawaa Alatrash,Shoeb Joarder*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 比较了自上而下和自下而上两种方法构建教育知识图谱（EduKG）的效果，发现自下而上方法更优，并结合人工干预进一步提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在MOOCs中自动构建EduKG的挑战，以支持更个性化和自适应的学习体验。

Method: 通过用户研究和专家验证（简单随机抽样）比较两种方法，并引入人工干预优化结果。

Result: 自下而上方法在准确识别和映射知识概念上表现更好。

Conclusion: 结合自下而上方法和人工干预，为MOOCs中的知识表示提供了可扩展的框架。

Abstract: The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is
crucial for modeling domain knowledge in digital learning environments,
particularly in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). However, identifying the
most effective approach for constructing accurate EduKGs remains a challenge.
This study compares Top-down and Bottom-up approaches for automatic EduKG
construction, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing and structuring
knowledge concepts from learning materials in our MOOC platform CourseMapper.
Through a user study and expert validation using Simple Random Sampling (SRS),
results indicate that the Bottom-up approach outperforms the Top-down approach
in accurately identifying and mapping key knowledge concepts. To further
enhance EduKG accuracy, we integrate a Human-in-the-Loop approach, allowing
course moderators to review and refine the EduKG before publication. This
structured comparison provides a scalable framework for improving knowledge
representation in MOOCs, ultimately supporting more personalized and adaptive
learning experiences.

### [5] [Lost in Models? Structuring Managerial Decision Support in Process Mining with Multi-criteria Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10236)
*Rob H. Bemthuis*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多准则决策（MCDM）的方法，通过结合定量和定性因素来评估和优先处理过程模型，以解决模型过载和决策复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代组织中过程挖掘的广泛应用导致模型数量激增，增加了决策的复杂性，需要一种综合方法来优化模型选择。

Method: 采用多准则决策方法（如层次分析法AHP），结合定量指标（如适应性、精确度）和定性因素（如文化契合度）评估过程模型。

Result: 通过物流案例展示了MCDM方法在权衡分析和与管理目标对齐方面的有效性，初步结果表明其能提升上下文敏感的决策能力。

Conclusion: 尽管研究处于早期阶段，但为MCDM驱动的策略在复杂组织环境中优化过程挖掘的作用提供了初步基础。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly adopted in modern organizations, producing
numerous process models that, while valuable, can lead to model overload and
decision-making complexity. This paper explores a multi-criteria
decision-making (MCDM) approach to evaluate and prioritize process models by
incorporating both quantitative metrics (e.g., fitness, precision) and
qualitative factors (e.g., cultural fit). An illustrative logistics example
demonstrates how MCDM, specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP),
facilitates trade-off analysis and promotes alignment with managerial
objectives. Initial insights suggest that the MCDM approach enhances
context-sensitive decision-making, as selected models address both operational
metrics and broader managerial needs. While this study is an early-stage
exploration, it provides an initial foundation for deeper exploration of
MCDM-driven strategies to enhance the role of process mining in complex
organizational settings.

### [6] [Formalising Human-in-the-Loop: Computational Reductions, Failure Modes, and Legal-Moral Responsibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10426)
*Maurice Chiodo,Dennis Müller,Paul Siewert,Jean-Luc Wetherall,Zoya Yasmine,John Burden*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了不同人机交互（HITL）设置的法律合规性与安全性，揭示了法律责任分配与技术可解释性之间的不可避免的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于为选择HITL设置提供新方法，并指出现有法律框架的不足。

Method: 采用计算理论中的预言机概念形式化HITL设置，并分类其失败模式。

Result: 揭示了HITL设置的技术局限性，并指出法律框架对某些设置的过度关注可能导致不理想的结果。

Conclusion: 结论强调HITL设计需考虑技术决策与法律责任的平衡，为开发者和立法者提供新视角。

Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups
for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing
between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between
the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.
We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to
formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human
monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction
between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one
reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL
failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL
setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and
EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always
achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest
areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups
and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and
unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve
many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often
out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the
challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers
and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.

### [7] [Campus AI vs Commercial AI: A Late-Breaking Study on How LLM As-A-Service Customizations Shape Trust and Usage Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10490)
*Leon Hannig,Annika Bush,Meltem Aksoy,Steffen Becker,Greta Ontrup*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型即服务（LLMaaS）的用户界面和品牌定制如何影响用户信任和使用模式，为后续大规模实地研究做铺垫。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育领域的普及，大学需要制定AI策略，而现有研究多关注数据或模型调整，本研究聚焦用户显性定制（如界面和品牌）对信任的影响。

Method: 通过小规模预研究，探讨LLMaaS定制化的心理效应，并收集反馈以优化后续大规模研究（德国大学学生和员工对定制LLMaaS与ChatGPT的感知比较）。

Result: 预研究旨在激发讨论并优化研究方法，为后续研究提供基础。

Conclusion: 未来研究将深化对LLMs信任动态的理解，为组织部署LLMaaS提供实用指导。

Abstract: As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) by students, lecturers and
researchers becomes more prevalent, universities - like other organizations -
are pressed to develop coherent AI strategies. LLMs as-a-Service (LLMaaS) offer
accessible pre-trained models, customizable to specific (business) needs. While
most studies prioritize data, model, or infrastructure adaptations (e.g., model
fine-tuning), we focus on user-salient customizations, like interface changes
and corporate branding, which we argue influence users' trust and usage
patterns. This study serves as a functional prequel to a large-scale field
study in which we examine how students and employees at a German university
perceive and use their institution's customized LLMaaS compared to ChatGPT. The
goals of this prequel are to stimulate discussions on psychological effects of
LLMaaS customizations and refine our research approach through feedback. Our
forthcoming findings will deepen the understanding of trust dynamics in LLMs,
providing practical guidance for organizations considering LLMaaS deployment.

### [8] [AI and Generative AI Transforming Disaster Management: A Survey of Damage Assessment and Response Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08202)
*Aman Raj,Lakshit Arora,Sanjay Surendranath Girija,Shashank Kapoor,Dipen Pradhan,Ankit Shetgaonkar*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文综述了AI和GenAI在自然灾害损害评估中的应用，探讨了其优势、局限性及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害对人类生命和基础设施构成巨大威胁，快速评估损害是关键。AI和GenAI提供了突破性解决方案。

Method: 结合多源数据（文本、图像、视频、音频），模拟灾害场景并识别趋势。

Result: AI和GenAI在损害评估中表现高效，但也存在数据隐私、安全和伦理问题。

Conclusion: 未来需开发安全、可靠且符合伦理的GenAI系统，以支持灾害管理。

Abstract: Natural disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires and cyclones, bear a huge
risk on human lives as well as infrastructure assets. An effective response to
disaster depends on the ability to rapidly and efficiently assess the intensity
of damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) presents a breakthrough solution, capable of combining knowledge from
multiple types and sources of data, simulating realistic scenarios of disaster,
and identifying emerging trends at a speed previously unimaginable. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive review on the prospects of AI and GenAI in
damage assessment for various natural disasters, highlighting both its
strengths and limitations. We talk about its application to multimodal data
such as text, image, video, and audio, and also cover major issues of data
privacy, security, and ethical use of the technology during crises. The paper
also recognizes the threat of Generative AI misuse, in the form of
dissemination of misinformation and for adversarial attacks. Finally, we
outline avenues of future research, emphasizing the need for secure, reliable,
and ethical Generative AI systems for disaster management in general. We
believe that this work represents the first comprehensive survey of Gen-AI
techniques being used in the field of Disaster Assessment and Response.

### [9] [Hamilton's Rule for Enabling Altruism in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09841)
*Brooks A. Butler,Magnus Egerstedt*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文将汉密尔顿规则应用于多智能体系统中的利他决策，提出基于任务生产力的框架，并通过图模型和协作控制Lyapunov函数实现，提升了导航任务的协调效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物利他主义启发，研究如何在多智能体系统中评估个体为邻居承担成本的决策。

Method: 通过图模型形式化利他决策，采用协作控制Lyapunov函数作为解决方案。

Result: 在导航任务仿真中，智能体的重要性水平影响利他决策，提升了系统协调效率。

Conclusion: 框架证明了利他行为对多智能体系统目标达成效率的贡献。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of Hamilton's rule to altruistic
decision-making in multi-agent systems. Inspired by biological altruism, we
introduce a framework that evaluates when individual agents should incur costs
to benefit their neighbors. By adapting Hamilton's rule, we define agent
``fitness" in terms of task productivity rather than genetic survival. We
formalize altruistic decision-making through a graph-based model of multi-agent
interactions and propose a solution using collaborative control Lyapunov
functions. The approach ensures that altruistic behaviors contribute to the
collective goal-reaching efficiency of the system. We illustrate this framework
on a multi-agent way-point navigation problem, where we show through simulation
how agent importance levels influence altruistic decision-making, leading to
improved coordination in navigation tasks.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Path Finding For Large Agents Is Intractable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10387)
*Artem Agafonov,Konstantin Yakovlev*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 该论文首次证明了考虑大尺寸智能体的多智能体路径规划（MAPF）问题是NP难问题，填补了该领域的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中（如机器人领域），智能体的尺寸不可忽略，但此前缺乏对这类问题的复杂性分析。

Method: 通过将经典的3SAT问题（NP完全问题）归约到MAPF问题，构造特定图例并证明其等价性。

Result: 证明了MAPF问题在大尺寸智能体情况下是NP难的，排除了多项式时间算法的可能性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为MAPF问题的复杂性提供了理论依据，并强调了实际应用中需考虑智能体尺寸的重要性。

Abstract: The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a
graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never
encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called
Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are
considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time
step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking
into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can
be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of
conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the
body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying
still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how
harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while
planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an
undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete
polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In
this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard
and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be
presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of
reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)
to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we
procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices
and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path
finding instance has a solution.

### [11] [Tales of the 2025 Los Angeles Fire: Hotwash for Public Health Concerns in Reddit via LLM-Enhanced Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09665)
*Sulong Zhou,Qunying Huang,Shaoheng Zhou,Yun Hang,Xinyue Ye,Aodong Mei,Kathryn Phung,Yuning Ye,Uma Govindswamy,Zehan Li*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 研究分析了2025年洛杉矶野火期间Reddit上的讨论，通过主题建模和分层框架，揭示了公众对灾难的感知和反应，重点关注情境意识和危机叙事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解受灾人群在野火危机中的感知和反应，为及时和富有同理心的灾难响应提供依据。

Method: 收集385篇帖子和114,879条评论，采用主题建模方法（结合LLMs和HITL）和分层框架（SA和CN）分析。

Result: SA类别与火灾进展紧密相关，CN类别中60%为悲伤信号，40%为心理健康风险。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个标注的社交媒体数据集，并提出可扩展的多层框架，为灾难响应和公共卫生沟通提供策略支持。

Abstract: Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent
years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during
wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social
media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public
discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment.
This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires,
spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385
posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt
topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large
language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we
develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two
main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The
volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking
within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most
frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and
damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related
latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one
health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60
percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest
total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated
social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable
multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse
analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can
inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public
health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related
disaster events.

*Anjali de Silva,Gang Chen,Hui Ma,Seyed Mohammad Nekooei,Xingquan Zuo*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: TAS-Com提出了一种新的社区检测方法，结合拓扑和属性相似性，通过Leiden算法优化模块化和人类标签的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCN方法在最大化模块化时易陷入次优解，且直接使用人类标签可能破坏拓扑连贯性。

Method: TAS-Com引入基于Leiden算法的新损失函数，优化社区检测的模块化和标签一致性。

Result: 实验表明TAS-Com在多个基准网络上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAS-Com在模块化和人类标签之间取得了理想平衡，提升了社区检测性能。

Abstract: Community detection, a vital technology for real-world applications, uncovers
cohesive node groups (communities) by leveraging both topological and attribute
similarities in social networks. However, existing Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) trained to maximize modularity often converge to suboptimal solutions.
Additionally, directly using human-labeled communities for training can
undermine topological cohesiveness by grouping disconnected nodes based solely
on node attributes. We address these issues by proposing a novel Topological
and Attributive Similarity-based Community detection (TAS-Com) method. TAS-Com
introduces a novel loss function that exploits the highly effective and
scalable Leiden algorithm to detect community structures with global optimal
modularity. Leiden is further utilized to refine human-labeled communities to
ensure connectivity within each community, enabling TAS-Com to detect community
structures with desirable trade-offs between modularity and compliance with
human labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark networks confirm that
TAS-Com can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms.

### [13] [Community Fact-Checks Do Not Break Follower Loyalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10254)
*Michelle Bobek,Nicolas Pröllochs*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 研究发现，社区事实核查不会显著减少发布误导内容的用户的粉丝数量，表明粉丝对发布者保持忠诚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补关于社区事实核查如何影响用户粉丝基础的空白，此前研究多关注其对互动的影响。

Method: 采用准实验方法，基于3516条社区核查帖子的时间序列数据，分析用户粉丝数量变化。

Result: 社区事实核查未导致发布误导内容的用户粉丝数量显著下降。

Conclusion: 需要采取补充干预措施，以更有效遏制社交媒体上的虚假信息传播。

Abstract: Major social media platforms increasingly adopt community-based fact-checking
to address misinformation on their platforms. While previous research has
largely focused on its effect on engagement (e.g., reposts, likes), an
understanding of how fact-checking affects a user's follower base is missing.
In this study, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally assess whether
users lose followers after their posts are corrected via community fact-checks.
Based on time-series data on follower counts for N=3516 community fact-checked
posts from X, we find that community fact-checks do not lead to meaningful
declines in the follower counts of users who post misleading content. This
suggests that followers of spreaders of misleading posts tend to remain loyal
and do not view community fact-checks as a sufficient reason to disengage. Our
findings underscore the need for complementary interventions to more
effectively disincentivize the production of misinformation on social media.

TL;DR: 研究通过分析X平台上91,452条误导性帖子，发现AI生成虚假信息更偏向娱乐内容、情感更积极，且多来自小账号，但更容易传播，但其可信度和危害性略低于传统虚假信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的虚假信息（如深度伪造）对社交媒体信息完整性构成威胁，但现有研究多关注其社会影响而非实际存在情况。

Method: 对X平台上91,452条AI生成和非AI生成的误导性帖子进行大规模实证分析，数据来自社区标记平台。

Result: AI生成虚假信息更娱乐化、情感积极，多来自小账号但传播更广，可信度和危害性略低。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI生成虚假信息的独特性，为平台管理和未来研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: AI-generated misinformation (e.g., deepfakes) poses a growing threat to
information integrity on social media. However, prior research has largely
focused on its potential societal consequences rather than its real-world
prevalence. In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of
AI-generated misinformation on the social media platform X. Specifically, we
analyze a dataset comprising N=91,452 misleading posts, both AI-generated and
non-AI-generated, that have been identified and flagged through X's Community
Notes platform. Our analysis yields four main findings: (i) AI-generated
misinformation is more often centered on entertaining content and tends to
exhibit a more positive sentiment than conventional forms of misinformation,
(ii) it is more likely to originate from smaller user accounts, (iii) despite
this, it is significantly more likely to go viral, and (iv) it is slightly less
believable and harmful compared to conventional misinformation. Altogether, our
findings highlight the unique characteristics of AI-generated misinformation on
social media. We discuss important implications for platforms and future
research.

Motivation: 计算$(p,q)$-biclique在推荐系统和子图分析中很重要，但精确计算因组合爆炸而困难，近似方法需求迫切。

Method: 利用$(p,q)$-broom的生成树特性，通过图着色和动态编程计数，并基于此设计高效采样算法。

Result: 理论证明无偏估计和误差保证，实验显示在9个真实网络中，误差减少8倍，速度提升50倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模$(p,q)$-biclique计数提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of
applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet,
it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to
exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel
methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable
and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a
special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph
coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results
of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to
derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts.
Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error
guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation
techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up
to 50$\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a
scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对游戏搜索算法性能通用性的研究，尤其是在双人零和完美信息游戏中。

Method: 提出了一种新的搜索算法，并在22种游戏中进行大规模实验。

Result: 短搜索时间下，新算法在所有游戏中表现最佳；中等搜索时间下，在17种游戏中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 新算法在双人零和完美信息游戏中具有显著优势，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Games, in their mathematical sense, are everywhere (game industries,
economics, defense, education, chemistry, biology, ...).Search algorithms in
games are artificial intelligence methods for playing such games.
Unfortunately, there is no study on these algorithms that evaluates the
generality of their performance. We propose to address this gap in the case of
two-player zero-sum games with perfect information. Furthermore, we propose a
new search algorithm and we show that, for a short search time, it outperforms
all studied algorithms on all games in this large experiment and that, for a
medium search time, it outperforms all studied algorithms on 17 of the 22
studied games.

TL;DR: 本文改进了现有技术，提出高效算法识别分类模型中的必要和相关性特征，并引入全局“有用性”概念，验证其与相关性和必要性的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在识别分类模型中的关键特征（如必要和相关特征）时效率不足，尤其是在复杂模型（如神经网络）中。本文旨在改进这些方法并扩展相关概念。

Method: 通过命题逻辑和“充分理由”概念，提出高效算法检测必要特征，并推广相关性概念。引入全局“有用性”概念，开发高效算法在决策树等模型中检测。

Result: 实验证明，新算法能高效识别必要特征，全局“有用性”与相关性和必要性相关，且在三个数据集中具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法和概念改进了特征重要性分析，为复杂模型中的特征解释提供了新工具。

Abstract: Given a classification model and a prediction for some input, there are
heuristic strategies for ranking features according to their importance in
regard to the prediction. One common approach to this task is rooted in
propositional logic and the notion of \textit{sufficient reason}. Through this
concept, the categories of relevant and necessary features were proposed in
order to identify the crucial aspects of the input. This paper improves the
existing techniques and algorithms for deciding which are the relevant and/or
necessary features, showing in particular that necessity can be detected
efficiently in complex models such as neural networks. We also generalize the
notion of relevancy and study associated problems. Moreover, we present a new
global notion (i.e. that intends to explain whether a feature is important for
the behavior of the model in general, not depending on a particular input) of
\textit{usefulness} and prove that it is related to relevancy and necessity.
Furthermore, we develop efficient algorithms for detecting it in decision trees
and other more complex models, and experiment on three datasets to analyze its
practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中目标识别（GR）面临目标众多且不断变化的挑战，传统方法难以适应。

Method: 采用无模型目标条件强化学习方法，实现快速适应。

Result: 提出了一种更通用的动态GR问题定义，并展示了方法的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时GR系统和进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Understanding an agent's intent through its behavior is essential in
human-robot interaction, interactive AI systems, and multi-agent
collaborations. This task, known as Goal Recognition (GR), poses significant
challenges in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and constantly
evolving. Traditional GR methods, designed for a predefined set of goals, often
struggle to adapt to these dynamic scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce the General Dynamic GR problem - a broader definition of GR - aimed
at enabling real-time GR systems and fostering further research in this area.
Expanding on this foundation, this paper employs a model-free goal-conditioned
RL approach to enable fast adaptation for GR across various changing tasks.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在肺部病理检测中决策不透明的问题，推动临床可解释AI的应用。

Method: 扩展ClinicXAI，采用InceptionV3分类器和公共数据集，对比后验解释方法和无监督CBM。

Result: XpertXAI在预测准确性和解释临床意义方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 人本模型设计可扩展到更广泛的诊断场景，为医学诊断提供可扩展的可解释AI路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in lung pathology detection from
chest X-rays, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited due to opaque
model decision-making. In prior work, we introduced ClinicXAI, a human-centric,
expert-guided concept bottleneck model (CBM) designed for interpretable lung
cancer diagnosis. We now extend that approach and present XpertXAI, a
generalizable expert-driven model that preserves human-interpretable clinical
concepts while scaling to detect multiple lung pathologies. Using a
high-performing InceptionV3-based classifier and a public dataset of chest
X-rays with radiology reports, we compare XpertXAI against leading post-hoc
explainability methods and an unsupervised CBM, XCBs. We assess explanations
through comparison with expert radiologist annotations and medical ground
truth. Although XpertXAI is trained for multiple pathologies, our expert
validation focuses on lung cancer. We find that existing techniques frequently
fail to produce clinically meaningful explanations, omitting key diagnostic
features and disagreeing with radiologist judgments. XpertXAI not only
outperforms these baselines in predictive accuracy but also delivers
concept-level explanations that better align with expert reasoning. While our
focus remains on explainability in lung cancer detection, this work illustrates
how human-centric model design can be effectively extended to broader
diagnostic contexts - offering a scalable path toward clinically meaningful
explainable AI in medical diagnostics.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在自动指标和基于LLM的评估中优于基线，生成更准确、结构化和可解释的报告。

Conclusion: 多代理框架在支持可解释和可信赖的临床AI应用方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce diagnostic
reports from medical images, with the potential to enhance clinical workflows
and reduce radiologists' workload. While recent approaches leveraging
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have achieved strong results, they continue to face challenges such as
factual inconsistency, hallucination, and cross-modal misalignment. We propose
a multimodal multi-agent framework for RRG that aligns with the stepwise
clinical reasoning workflow, where task-specific agents handle retrieval, draft
generation, visual analysis, refinement, and synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms a strong baseline in both automatic
metrics and LLM-based evaluations, producing more accurate, structured, and
interpretable reports. This work highlights the potential of clinically aligned
multi-agent frameworks to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI
applications.

Abstract: The trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of relentless
acceleration, evolving from rudimentary rule-based systems to sophisticated,
autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and interaction. This whitepaper
chronicles this remarkable journey, charting the key technological
milestones--advancements in prompting, training methodologies, hardware
capabilities, and architectural innovations--that have converged to create the
AI agents of today. We argue that these agents, exemplified by systems like
OpenAI's ChatGPT with plugins and xAI's Grok, represent a culminating phase in
AI development, potentially constituting the "final generation" of intelligence
as we currently conceive it. We explore the capabilities and underlying
technologies of these agents, grounded in practical examples, while also
examining the profound societal implications and the unprecedented pace of
progress that suggests intelligence is now doubling approximately every six
months. The paper concludes by underscoring the critical need for wisdom and
foresight in navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by this
powerful new era of intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对问题质量的全面评估研究有限，因此需要建立一个系统性的框架来定义和评估好问题。

Method: 研究提出了基于两个关键维度的评分系统，并结合动态语境变量，使用CAUS和SQUARE数据集验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 框架能够评估形式良好和有问题的提问，并能适应不同语境。

Conclusion: 该研究为问题评估提供了一个灵活且全面的框架，为将提问行为与结构化分析方法结合奠定了基础。

Abstract: Questioning has become increasingly crucial for both humans and artificial
intelligence, yet there remains limited research comprehensively assessing
question quality. In response, this study defines good questions and presents a
systematic evaluation framework. We propose two key evaluation dimensions:
appropriateness (sociolinguistic competence in context) and effectiveness
(strategic competence in goal achievement). Based on these foundational
dimensions, a rubric-based scoring system was developed. By incorporating
dynamic contextual variables, our evaluation framework achieves structure and
flexibility through semi-adaptive criteria. The methodology was validated using
the CAUS and SQUARE datasets, demonstrating the ability of the framework to
access both well-formed and problematic questions while adapting to varied
contexts. As we establish a flexible and comprehensive framework for question
evaluation, this study takes a significant step toward integrating questioning
behavior with structured analytical methods grounded in the intrinsic nature of
questioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法假设人类常识是单一的，但实证表明人类常识存在巨大差异，因此需要一种新方法来更准确地评估AI的常识能力。

Result: LLMs在常识能力上低于人类中位数，与人类相关性有限；小型模型表现优于大型模型。

Conclusion: 框架强调AI模型需适应不同文化背景的人类群体，为AI常识评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks
that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An
important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately
capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as
homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary
enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident
to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel
method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),
specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically
observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a
model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when
treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human
median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as
simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only
modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In
both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than
larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties
commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call
for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often
incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.

Motivation: MOOCs缺乏师生直接互动，学习者难以理解新知识概念，而现有LLMs存在幻觉问题，RAG系统又受限于非结构化学习材料且无法主动引导学习者。

Method: 提出Graph RAG管道，结合EduKG和PKG，实现基于PKG的个性化问题生成和基于EduKG的问答方法。

Result: 在CourseMapper平台上对3门MOOCs的专家评估显示，Graph RAG能有效帮助学习者理解新知识概念。

Conclusion: Graph RAG为MOOCs学习者提供了个性化的学习体验，展示了其在知识理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners
and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge
concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models
(LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to
hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a
response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by
unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not
actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these
challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational
Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide
learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.
Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to
recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an
EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between
knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To
evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3
different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the
evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand
new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.

Conclusion: Pre-Act方法显著提升了代理系统的性能，特别是在小模型上的微调效果显著，为实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has
become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as
DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through
the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise
before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act,
a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step
execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This
plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining
itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our
approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To
measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a
two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our
turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach,
Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While
this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for
practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often
struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address
this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B &
70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the
fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action
accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate
(end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.

Result: 提出了一个多模态抑郁检测挑战，并提供了基线模型，以促进更个性化和准确的抑郁检测方法的发展。

Conclusion: MPDD挑战旨在推动心理健康研究的进步，并促进包容性抑郁检测系统的开发。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health issue affecting diverse age groups,
with notable prevalence among college students and the elderly. However,
existing datasets and detection methods primarily focus on young adults,
neglecting the broader age spectrum and individual differences that influence
depression manifestation. Current approaches often establish a direct mapping
between multimodal data and depression indicators, failing to capture the
complexity and diversity of depression across individuals. This challenge
includes two tracks based on age-specific subsets: Track 1 uses the
MPDD-Elderly dataset for detecting depression in older adults, and Track 2 uses
the MPDD-Young dataset for detecting depression in younger participants. The
Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection (MPDD) Challenge aims to
address this gap by incorporating multimodal data alongside individual
difference factors. We provide a baseline model that fuses audio and video
modalities with individual difference information to detect depression
manifestations in diverse populations. This challenge aims to promote the
development of more personalized and accurate de pression detection methods,
advancing mental health research and fostering inclusive detection systems.

Abstract: Taiwanese China Studies (CS) has developed into a rich, interdisciplinary
research field shaped by the unique geopolitical position and long standing
academic engagement with Mainland China. This study responds to the growing
need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS
scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured
academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply
generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and
standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles
published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a
lightweight D3.js based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific
knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows
users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus,
revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters,
and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured
knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text
consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances
scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven
alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only
demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities
but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly
infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.

Abstract: As the field of healthcare increasingly adopts artificial intelligence, it
becomes important to understand which types of explanations increase
transparency and empower users to develop confidence and trust in the
predictions made by machine learning (ML) systems. In shared decision-making
scenarios where doctors cooperate with ML systems to reach an appropriate
decision, establishing mutual trust is crucial. In this paper, we explore
different approaches to generating explanations in eXplainable AI (XAI) and
make their underlying arguments explicit so that they can be evaluated by
medical experts. In particular, we present the findings of a user study
conducted with physicians to investigate their perceptions of various types of
AI-generated explanations in the context of diagnostic decision support. The
study aims to identify the most effective and useful explanations that enhance
the diagnostic process. In the study, medical doctors filled out a survey to
assess different types of explanations. Further, an interview was carried out
post-survey to gain qualitative insights on the requirements of explanations
incorporated in diagnostic decision support. Overall, the insights gained from
this study contribute to understanding the types of explanations that are most
effective.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent has gained significant attention for their potential in
simulation and enhancing performance. However, existing works are limited to
pure simulations or are constrained by predefined workflows, restricting their
applicability and effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent
Scaling Simulation (MASS) for portfolio construction. MASS achieves stable and
continuous excess returns by progressively increasing the number of agents for
large-scale simulations to gain a superior understanding of the market and
optimizing agent distribution end-to-end through a reverse optimization
process, rather than relying on a fixed workflow. We demonstrate its
superiority through performance experiments, ablation studies, backtesting
experiments, experiments on updated data and stock pools, scaling experiments,
parameter sensitivity experiments, and visualization experiments, conducted in
comparison with 6 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 challenging A-share stock
pools. We expect the paradigm established by MASS to expand to other tasks with
similar characteristics. The implementation of MASS has been open-sourced at

Result: MILP求解器在高度约束或不可行问题中表现更好，SMT求解器在多样化排班问题中更优，但对约束表达更敏感。

Abstract: The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working
conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However,
the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare
scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades,
with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).
SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last
decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to
outperform standard mathematical programming techniques.
  In this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a
wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints
are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective
state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired
rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for
certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the
problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs
better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set
of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted
during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the
generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and
experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based
methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of
personnel scheduling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为‘可塑性’的代理中心度量，揭示了其与‘赋权’的基本联系，并探讨了两者在代理设计中的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代理如何被其观察所影响，以及这种影响的程度和方式，填补了现有理论中对代理‘可塑性’的量化空白。

Method: 通过定义一种新的信息论量——广义定向信息，严格推广了Massey（1990）的定向信息，并基于此定义了可塑性。

Result: 发现可塑性是赋权的镜像，两者之间存在张力，代理设计需同时考虑这两种特性。

Conclusion: 可塑性、赋权及其关系对理解代理行为至关重要，为代理设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations
and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by
empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial
intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally
foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by
what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal
agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental
connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable
definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we
call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity
strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while
preserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that
plasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to
the empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding
establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent,
suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We
explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity,
empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解释评估方法依赖真实解释或模型敏感性，存在局限性，需要更独立的质量评估标准。

Method: 提出AXE框架，基于三个原则设计，无需真实解释或模型敏感性，提供独立评估。

Result: AXE与基线方法比较验证有效性，并能检测解释公平性伪装。

Conclusion: AXE为解释评估提供了独立且实用的框架，适用于无真实解释的场景。

Abstract: There can be many competing and contradictory explanations for a single model
prediction, making it difficult to select which one to use. Current explanation
evaluation frameworks measure quality by comparing against ideal "ground-truth"
explanations, or by verifying model sensitivity to important inputs. We outline
the limitations of these approaches, and propose three desirable principles to
ground the future development of explanation evaluation strategies for local
feature importance explanations. We propose a ground-truth Agnostic eXplanation
Evaluation framework (AXE) for evaluating and comparing model explanations that
satisfies these principles. Unlike prior approaches, AXE does not require
access to ideal ground-truth explanations for comparison, or rely on model
sensitivity - providing an independent measure of explanation quality. We
verify AXE by comparing with baselines, and show how it can be used to detect
explanation fairwashing. Our code is available at

Result: 展示了AI Agents在任务自动化中的应用，以及Agentic AI在多智能体协作和动态任务分解中的优势，并提出了针对性解决方案。

Conclusion: 为AI Agents和Agentic AI系统的开发提供了明确的路线图。

Abstract: This study critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI,
offering a structured conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and challenge
analysis to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We
begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions,
characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation.
Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through
tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast,
Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent
collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated
autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution,
operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a
comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as
customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with
Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and
medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm
including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination
failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration
layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for
developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven
systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在动态环境中作为自学习和推理代理的真实潜力，评估其自适应能力。

Method: 通过自反思、启发式变异和规划等提示技术，在动态环境中测试不同开源语言模型的性能。

Result: 大模型表现优于小模型，但战略提示能缩小差距；高级提示对小模型在复杂任务中更有效，但对大模型提升有限；推理方法效果不稳定。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在关键推理任务上仍有局限，需超越静态基准以全面评估推理能力。

Abstract: While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static
benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and
reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of
agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math
word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important
shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move
beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声分析对左心房血流动力学的理解有限，4D Flow MRI虽有望提升理解，但低流速和空间分辨率限制以及缺乏专用计算框架阻碍了研究。

Method: 开发了一个开源计算框架，支持对不同来源和质量的4D Flow MRI数据进行定性和定量分析，并评估了能量、涡度和压力参数作为预后生物标志物的潜力。

Result: 框架在不同中心的数据上表现稳健，实现了高精度自动分割（Dice > 0.9，Hausdorff 95 < 3 mm），并首次全面评估了LA的血流动力学参数。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LA血流动力学提供了强大工具，并展示了血流动力学参数作为预后生物标志物的潜力。

Abstract: The left atrium (LA) plays a pivotal role in modulating left ventricular
filling, but our comprehension of its hemodynamics is significantly limited by
the constraints of conventional ultrasound analysis. 4D flow magnetic resonance
imaging (4D Flow MRI) holds promise for enhancing our understanding of atrial
hemodynamics. However, the low velocities within the LA and the limited spatial
resolution of 4D Flow MRI make analyzing this chamber challenging. Furthermore,
the absence of dedicated computational frameworks, combined with diverse
acquisition protocols and vendors, complicates gathering large cohorts for
studying the prognostic value of hemodynamic parameters provided by 4D Flow
MRI. In this study, we introduce the first open-source computational framework
tailored for the analysis of 4D Flow MRI in the LA, enabling comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative analysis of advanced hemodynamic parameters. Our
framework proves robust to data from different centers of varying quality,
producing high-accuracy automated segmentations (Dice $>$ 0.9 and Hausdorff 95
$<$ 3 mm), even with limited training data. Additionally, we conducted the
first comprehensive assessment of energy, vorticity, and pressure parameters in
the LA across a spectrum of disorders to investigate their potential as
prognostic biomarkers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于文本描述生成长时间双人运动的挑战，特别是现有Transformer方法在长序列上的局限性。

Method: 采用状态空间模型（SSM）和简单架构，通过序列拼接实现信息流动，避免复杂的跨注意力机制。

Result: 在短期基准上表现优异，长期序列上显著优于Transformer方法，并提出了新的评估基准。

Conclusion: SSM架构为长期双人运动合成提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Generating realistic dyadic human motion from text descriptions presents
significant challenges, particularly for extended interactions that exceed
typical training sequence lengths. While recent transformer-based approaches
have shown promising results for short-term dyadic motion synthesis, they
struggle with longer sequences due to inherent limitations in positional
encoding schemes. In this paper, we introduce Dyadic Mamba, a novel approach
that leverages State-Space Models (SSMs) to generate high-quality dyadic human
motion of arbitrary length. Our method employs a simple yet effective
architecture that facilitates information flow between individual motion
sequences through concatenation, eliminating the need for complex
cross-attention mechanisms. We demonstrate that Dyadic Mamba achieves
competitive performance on standard short-term benchmarks while significantly
outperforming transformer-based approaches on longer sequences. Additionally,
we propose a new benchmark for evaluating long-term motion synthesis quality,
providing a standardized framework for future research. Our results demonstrate
that SSM-based architectures offer a promising direction for addressing the
challenging task of long-term dyadic human motion synthesis from text
descriptions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需依赖未标注数据的医学图像分割方法BoundarySeg，通过多任务框架结合器官边界预测提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据获取和标注困难，半监督方法依赖未标注数据且效果受限。

Method: BoundarySeg框架结合器官边界预测与分割任务，利用任务间一致性提供额外监督。

Result: 在低数据情况下表现优异，性能媲美或超越现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: BoundarySeg提供了一种高效且无需未标注数据的医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale medical data, annotated or unannotated, is challenging
due to stringent privacy regulations and data protection policies. In addition,
annotating medical images requires that domain experts manually delineate
anatomical structures, making the process both time-consuming and costly. As a
result, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity for reducing annotation
costs. However, the performance of semi-supervised methods is heavily dependent
on the availability of unannotated data, and their effectiveness declines when
such data are scarce or absent. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
simple, yet effective and computationally efficient approach for medical image
segmentation that leverages only existing annotations. We propose BoundarySeg ,
a multi-task framework that incorporates organ boundary prediction as an
auxiliary task to full organ segmentation, leveraging consistency between the
two task predictions to provide additional supervision. This strategy improves
segmentation accuracy, especially in low data regimes, allowing our method to
achieve performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art semi supervised
approaches all without relying on unannotated data or increasing computational
demands. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Computer-assisted interventions can improve intra-operative guidance,
particularly through deep learning methods that harness the spatiotemporal
information in surgical videos. However, the severe data imbalance often found
in surgical video datasets hinders the development of high-performing models.
In this work, we aim to overcome the data imbalance by synthesizing surgical
videos. We propose a unique two-stage, text-conditioned diffusion-based method
to generate high-fidelity surgical videos for under-represented classes. Our
approach conditions the generation process on text prompts and decouples
spatial and temporal modeling by utilizing a 2D latent diffusion model to
capture spatial content and then integrating temporal attention layers to
ensure temporal consistency. Furthermore, we introduce a rejection sampling
strategy to select the most suitable synthetic samples, effectively augmenting
existing datasets to address class imbalance. We evaluate our method on two
downstream tasks-surgical action recognition and intra-operative event
prediction-demonstrating that incorporating synthetic videos from our approach
substantially enhances model performance. We open-source our implementation at

Motivation: 研究人类如何从少量示例中学习视觉概念，强调结构化表示和类比映射的重要性。

Method: 提出Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI)模型，结合深度学习和类比映射，权衡对象相似性和关系相似性。

Result: PSI表现接近人类学习能力，优于非结构化模型和弱结构化变体。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和类比映射是快速学习视觉概念的关键，深度学习可用于构建心理学模型。

Abstract: The ability to learn new visual concepts from limited examples is a hallmark
of human cognition. While traditional category learning models represent each
example as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is
thought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed
graphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of
shared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,
we introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that
employs deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured
representations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept
called a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity
that weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a
mechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to
selective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces
human-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model
that uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,
and a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find
that PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that
increases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the
contribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that
structured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling
rapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how
deep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models.

Result: 在EuRoc和KITTI数据集上表现优于现有神经、3DGS和传统方法。

Conclusion: LSG-SLAM为大规模户外场景提供了一种高效且鲁棒的视觉SLAM解决方案。

Abstract: The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM.
However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only
available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in
large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a
large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The
proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses
under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping
constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in
rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce
continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited
memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the
relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and
feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and
Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction
quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM
achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even
traditional approaches. Project page: https://lsg-slam.github.io.

Conclusion: AdaptCLIP提供了一种无需目标领域微调的跨领域异常检测解决方案，具有高效和灵活性。

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies from novel or
unseen vision domains without additional fine-tuning, which is critical in open
scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language
models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal
images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates,
complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in
limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method
called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual
representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second,
comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate
both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on
residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service,
adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and
prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports
zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free
manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial
and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods.
We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了SFDA中的域差距问题，提升了伪标签和图像风格转换质量，同时提高了训练效率。

Abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the challenge of model performance degradation
caused by domain gaps. In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,
labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are
used to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,
particularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As
a result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation
(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and
unlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA
methods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and
self-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target
domain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images
and pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.
Moreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under
limited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to
address these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of
domain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to
generate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model
and allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without
introducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent
frequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a
source-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related
layer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target
model using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels. Extensive
experiments on cross-modality abdominal and cardiac SFDA segmentation tasks
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human behavior in-thewild, particularly at urban
intersections, remains crucial for enhancing interaction safety between road
users. Among the most critical behaviors are crossing intentions of Vulnerable
Road Users (VRUs), where misinterpretation may result in dangerous conflicts
with oncoming vehicles. In this work, we propose the VRU-CIPI framework with a
sequential attention-based model designed to predict VRU crossing intentions at
intersections. VRU-CIPI employs Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture temporal
dynamics in VRU movements, combined with a multi-head Transformer
self-attention mechanism to encode contextual and spatial dependencies critical
for predicting crossing direction. Evaluated on UCF-VRU dataset, our proposed
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 96.45% and achieving
real-time inference speed reaching 33 frames per second. Furthermore, by
integrating with Infrastructure-to-Vehicles (I2V) communication, our approach
can proactively enhance intersection safety through timely activation of
crossing signals and providing early warnings to connected vehicles, ensuring
smoother and safer interactions for all road users.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel remote sensing change detection task,
non-registration change detection, to address the increasing number of
emergencies such as natural disasters, anthropogenic accidents, and military
strikes. First, in light of the limited discourse on the issue of
non-registration change detection, we systematically propose eight scenarios

of non-registration problems. Second, we develop distinct image transformation
schemes tailored to various scenarios to convert the available registration

Result: 在NUDT-SIRST、IRSTD-1k和NUAA-SIRST数据集上，CSPENet优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: CSPENet通过结合轮廓和显著性先验，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a critical role in a wide range
of civilian and military applications. Existing methods suffer from
deficiencies in the localization of dim targets and the perception of contour
information under dense clutter environments, severely limiting their detection
performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a contour-aware and saliency
priors embedding network (CSPENet) for ISTD. We first design a
surround-convergent prior extraction module (SCPEM) that effectively captures
the intrinsic characteristic of target contour pixel gradients converging
toward their center. This module concurrently extracts two collaborative
priors: a boosted saliency prior for accurate target localization and
multi-scale structural priors for comprehensively enriching contour detail
representation. Building upon this, we propose a dual-branch priors embedding
architecture (DBPEA) that establishes differentiated feature fusion pathways,
embedding these two priors at optimal network positions to achieve performance
enhancement. Finally, we develop an attention-guided feature enhancement module
(AGFEM) to refine feature representations and improve saliency estimation
accuracy. Experimental results on public datasets NUDT-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and
NUAA-SIRST demonstrate that our CSPENet outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods in detection performance. The code is available at

Result: 在RAF-DB和KDEF数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TKDF的引入有效提升了面部表情识别的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild remains a challenging task
due to the subtle and localized nature of expression-related features, as well
as the complex variations in facial appearance. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework that explicitly focuses on Texture Key Driver Factors (TKDF),
localized texture regions that exhibit strong discriminative power across
emotional categories. By carefully observing facial image patterns, we identify
that certain texture cues, such as micro-changes in skin around the brows,
eyes, and mouth, serve as primary indicators of emotional dynamics. To
effectively capture and leverage these cues, we propose a FER architecture
comprising a Texture-Aware Feature Extractor (TAFE) and Dual Contextual
Information Filtering (DCIF). TAFE employs a ResNet-based backbone enhanced
with multi-branch attention to extract fine-grained texture representations,
while DCIF refines these features by filtering context through adaptive pooling
and attention mechanisms. Experimental results on RAF-DB and KDEF datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, verifying
the effectiveness and robustness of incorporating TKDFs into FER pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ALS点云分割中因环境、传感器变化导致的模型性能下降问题，填补CTTA在该领域的研究空白。

Method: 提出动态可训练层选择模块、熵一致性损失和随机参数插值机制，构建ISPRSC和H3DC两个基准数据集。

Result: 在ISPRSC和H3DC基准上，mIoU分别提升约9%和14%。

Conclusion: APCoTTA有效解决了ALS点云分割中的领域适应问题，并提供了新的基准和开源代码。

Abstract: Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task
for large-scale 3D scene understanding. In real-world applications, models are
typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the
environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in
model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by
adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.
Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing
challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of
catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To
tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for
ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer
selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select
low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we
propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on
entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing
model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation
mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers
with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation
and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we
construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA
benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate
that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU
improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference. The new
benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.

TL;DR: HQUIC是一种针对水下图像压缩的算法，通过利用水下图像特有的特征（如衰减系数和全局光信息）以及动态加权多尺度频率组件，显著提升了压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水下图像压缩算法未能充分利用水下场景的独特性，导致性能不佳。HQUIC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HQUIC采用ALTC模块预测衰减系数和全局光信息，并利用代码本提取水下图像中的常见对象，同时动态加权多尺度频率组件。

Result: 在多种水下数据集上的评估显示，HQUIC优于现有压缩方法。

Conclusion: HQUIC通过针对性设计，显著提升了水下图像压缩的效率和质量。

Abstract: With the increasing exploration and exploitation of the underwater world,
underwater images have become a critical medium for human interaction with
marine environments, driving extensive research into their efficient
transmission and storage. However, contemporary underwater image compression
algorithms fail to fully leverage the unique characteristics distinguishing
underwater scenes from terrestrial images, resulting in suboptimal performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce HQUIC, designed to exploit
underwater-image-specific features for enhanced compression efficiency. HQUIC
employs an ALTC module to adaptively predict the attenuation coefficients and
global light information of the images, which effectively mitigates the issues
caused by the differences in lighting and tone existing in underwater images.
Subsequently, HQUIC employs a codebook as an auxiliary branch to extract the
common objects within underwater images and enhances the performance of the
main branch. Furthermore, HQUIC dynamically weights multi-scale frequency
components, prioritizing information critical for distortion quality while
discarding redundant details. Extensive evaluations on diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate that HQUIC outperforms state-of-the-art compression
methods.

Motivation: 现有基准仅关注对象定位任务，缺乏对多模态指向能力的全面评估。

Method: 提出PointArena平台，包含Point-Bench数据集、Point-Battle交互竞技场和Point-Act机器人系统，评估多模态模型的指向能力。

Result: Molmo-72B表现最优，监督训练显著提升性能，且多阶段评估结果强相关。

Conclusion: 精确的指向能力对多模态模型连接抽象推理与具体行动至关重要。

Abstract: Pointing serves as a fundamental and intuitive mechanism for grounding
language within visual contexts, with applications spanning robotics, assistive
technologies, and interactive AI systems. While recent multimodal models have
started to support pointing capabilities, existing benchmarks typically focus
only on referential object localization tasks. We introduce PointArena, a
comprehensive platform for evaluating multimodal pointing across diverse
reasoning scenarios. PointArena comprises three components: (1) Point-Bench, a
curated dataset containing approximately 1,000 pointing tasks across five
reasoning categories; (2) Point-Battle, an interactive, web-based arena
facilitating blind, pairwise model comparisons, which has already gathered over
4,500 anonymized votes; and (3) Point-Act, a real-world robotic manipulation
system allowing users to directly evaluate multimodal model pointing
capabilities in practical settings. We conducted extensive evaluations of both
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary multimodal models. Results
indicate that Molmo-72B consistently outperforms other models, though
proprietary models increasingly demonstrate comparable performance.
Additionally, we find that supervised training specifically targeting pointing
tasks significantly enhances model performance. Across our multi-stage
evaluation pipeline, we also observe strong correlations, underscoring the
critical role of precise pointing capabilities in enabling multimodal models to
effectively bridge abstract reasoning with concrete, real-world actions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种描述性图像-文本匹配方法（DITM），通过探索语言的描述灵活性学习图像与文本的渐进上下文相似性，解决了现有稀疏二元监督方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用稀疏二元监督，忽略了图像与文本之间多对多的对应关系，且未考虑从一般到具体描述的隐含联系。

Method: DITM通过计算句子的描述性分数（基于TF-IDF），动态调整正负样本的连通性，并按从通用到具体的顺序对齐相关句子。

Result: 在MS-COCO、Flickr30K和CxC数据集上的实验表明，DITM能更有效地表示复杂的图像-文本关系，并提升模型的层次推理能力。

Conclusion: DITM通过超越刚性二元监督，显著提升了图像-文本匹配的精确性和潜在正样本的发现能力。

Abstract: Image-text matching aims to build correspondences between visual and textual
data by learning their pairwise similarities. Most existing approaches have
adopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and
sentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited
subset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many
correspondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different
descriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit
connections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying
rationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In
this work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn
the graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the
descriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of
each sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency
(TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the
sentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust
image-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling,
dynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and
(2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a
generic-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM
enhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs.
Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, DITM enhances the
hierarchical reasoning ability of the model, supported by the extensive
analysis on HierarCaps benchmark.

Abstract: In the era of immersive consumer electronics, such as AR/VR headsets and
smart devices, people increasingly seek ways to express their identity through
virtual fashion. However, existing 3D garment design tools remain inaccessible
to everyday users due to steep technical barriers and limited data. In this
work, we introduce a 3D sketch-driven 3D garment generation framework that
empowers ordinary users - even those without design experience - to create
high-quality digital clothing through simple 3D sketches in AR/VR environments.
By combining a conditional diffusion model, a sketch encoder trained in a
shared latent space, and an adaptive curriculum learning strategy, our system
interprets imprecise, free-hand input and produces realistic, personalized
garments. To address the scarcity of training data, we also introduce
KO3DClothes, a new dataset of paired 3D garments and user-created sketches.
Extensive experiments and user studies confirm that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in both fidelity and usability, demonstrating
its promise for democratized fashion design on next-generation consumer
platforms.

Motivation: 现有一次性学习方法在单领域表现良好，但在多领域未标记数据中易受领域偏好影响，且对次优标注图像不鲁棒。

Result: 在三个不同解剖领域的X射线数据集上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: UOD通过领域共享模块聚合多领域样本，显著提升鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: One-shot medical landmark detection gains much attention and achieves great
success for its label-efficient training process. However, existing one-shot
learning methods are highly specialized in a single domain and suffer domain
preference heavily in the situation of multi-domain unlabeled data. Moreover,
one-shot learning is not robust that it faces performance drop when annotating
a sub-optimal image. To tackle these issues, we resort to developing a
domain-adaptive one-shot landmark detection framework for handling multi-domain
medical images, named Universal One-shot Detection (UOD). UOD consists of two
stages and two corresponding universal models which are designed as
combinations of domain-specific modules and domain-shared modules. In the first
stage, a domain-adaptive convolution model is self-supervised learned to
generate pseudo landmark labels. In the second stage, we design a
domain-adaptive transformer to eliminate domain preference and build the global
context for multi-domain data. Even though only one annotated sample from each
domain is available for training, the domain-shared modules help UOD aggregate
all one-shot samples to detect more robust and accurate landmarks. We
investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively the proposed UOD on three
widely-used public X-ray datasets in different anatomical domains (i.e., head,
hand, chest) and obtained state-of-the-art performances in each domain. The
code is available at

Abstract: This paper does not describe a new method; instead, it provides a thorough
exploration of an important yet understudied design space related to recent
advances in text-to-image synthesis -- specifically, the deep fusion of large

generation. Previous studies mainly focused on overall system performance
rather than detailed comparisons with alternative methods, and key design
details and training recipes were often left undisclosed. These gaps create
uncertainty about the real potential of this approach. To fill these gaps, we
conduct an empirical study on text-to-image generation, performing controlled
comparisons with established baselines, analyzing important design choices, and
providing a clear, reproducible recipe for training at scale. We hope this work
offers meaningful data points and practical guidelines for future research in
multi-modal generation.

Abstract: Dynamic scene representation and reconstruction have undergone transformative
advances in recent years, catalyzed by breakthroughs in neural radiance fields
and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. While initially developed for static
environments, these methodologies have rapidly evolved to address the
complexities inherent in 4D dynamic scenes through an expansive body of
research. Coupled with innovations in differentiable volumetric rendering,
these approaches have significantly enhanced the quality of motion
representation and dynamic scene reconstruction, thereby garnering substantial
attention from the computer vision and graphics communities. This survey
presents a systematic analysis of over 200 papers focused on dynamic scene
representation using radiance field, spanning the spectrum from implicit neural
representations to explicit Gaussian primitives. We categorize and evaluate
these works through multiple critical lenses: motion representation paradigms,
reconstruction techniques for varied scene dynamics, auxiliary information
integration strategies, and regularization approaches that ensure temporal
consistency and physical plausibility. We organize diverse methodological
approaches under a unified representational framework, concluding with a
critical examination of persistent challenges and promising research
directions. By providing this comprehensive overview, we aim to establish a
definitive reference for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field while
offering experienced practitioners a systematic understanding of both
conceptual principles and practical frontiers in dynamic scene reconstruction.

cursive nature of its script and a scarcity of structured datasets. To address
this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one
million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document
levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different
architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.
PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes,
and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the
performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's
Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four
closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results
demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas
among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful
assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in
Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR
but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. PsOCR is
available at https://github.com/zirak-ai/PashtoOCR.

TL;DR: ToonifyGB是一个两阶段框架，用于从单目视频生成多样化的风格化3D头部虚拟形象，结合了改进的StyleGAN和高斯混合形状技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Toonify框架以生成风格化的3D头部虚拟形象，解决传统StyleGAN在固定分辨率裁剪对齐人脸时的局限性。

Method: 第一阶段使用改进的StyleGAN生成风格化视频，第二阶段学习风格化的中性头部模型和表情混合形状，结合两者渲染风格化虚拟形象。

Result: 在Arcane和Pixar两种风格上验证了ToonifyGB的高效性，能够生成高质量的风格化动画。

Conclusion: ToonifyGB成功实现了从单目视频到风格化3D虚拟形象的高效生成，适用于多样化的风格需求。

Abstract: The introduction of 3D Gaussian blendshapes has enabled the real-time
reconstruction of animatable head avatars from monocular video. Toonify, a
StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization.
To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using
Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB.
In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to
generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the
limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for
normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables
Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video
frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In
Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head
model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By
combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can
efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the
effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane
and Pixar.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMRL和MMRL++通过共享模态无关表示空间和优化表示令牌，解决了少样本学习中的过拟合问题，显著提升了跨模态任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练视觉语言模型在少样本学习中容易过拟合，泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出MMRL，引入共享表示空间，优化表示令牌和类令牌；MMRL++进一步减少参数并增强模态内交互。

Result: 在15个数据集上表现优于现有方法，平衡了任务适应和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MMRL和MMRL++有效提升了少样本学习的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly
advanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models
with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their
ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal
Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,
modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected
into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more
effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize
class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder
layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving
general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and
representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is
applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection
layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To
further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning
class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,
a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base
tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger
generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient
and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters
and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of
representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific
information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive
experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently
outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between
task-specific adaptation and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoB方法通过双目标覆盖问题优化视觉令牌修剪，平衡任务目标并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌修剪方法采用静态策略，忽视任务间目标重要性差异，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出基于Hausdorff距离的误差界限，利用ε-覆盖理论揭示目标间权衡，设计MoB方法动态分配预算。

Result: MoB保留96.4%性能仅用11.1%令牌，加速1.3-1.5倍，适用于多种任务和模型。

Conclusion: MoB通过动态权衡目标，显著提升视觉令牌修剪的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual
preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative
importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent
performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for
visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing
the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\epsilon$-covering
theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify
their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle
this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which
reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this
framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy
radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability
with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to
challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves
96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual
tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\times$ with negligible
performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm
that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language
tasks.

Method: 采用条件U-Net架构，充分利用条件信息，无需固定图像，实现图像配准。

Result: 在临床4D-CT数据上实现了无伪影的实时重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂条件下表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a novel image registration formalism dedicated to
the estimation of unknown condition-related images, based on two or more known
images and their associated conditions. We show how to practically model this
formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into
account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our
formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at
different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal
regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to
stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at
different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then
generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to
irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing
signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase
artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/Kheil-Z/IMITATE .

Result: 在多个域泛化数据集上显著优于现有联邦域泛化方法。

Conclusion: MCSAD通过交替进行风格增强和域不变学习，有效提升了模型在未见目标域的泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from
multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target
domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain
generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore
the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style
information across existing source domains under the data decentralization
scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose
a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning
method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a
multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the
broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between
the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within
the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different
classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting
collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can
generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple
domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在多数据集上表现不佳，主要由于数据集偏差，需解决泛化问题。

Method: 提出一种扩展的编码器-解码器结构，仅需少于20个数据集特定参数，适应新数据。

Result: 新模型在MIT/Tuebingen基准测试中表现最佳，泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 少量数据集特定参数能有效解决泛化问题，同时揭示空间显著性特性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold
standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we
show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains
challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around
40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly,
increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with
close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining
generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly
dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific
parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure,
center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data
accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of
the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark
(MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from
unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the
respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into
spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine
both absolute and relative sizes.

Abstract: Location Intelligence (LI), the science of transforming location-centric
geospatial data into actionable knowledge, has become a cornerstone of modern
spatial decision-making. The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation
Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive
technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging
large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have
demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured
geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent
integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal
geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey
presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across
both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on
the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological
perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current
advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future
research directions in the LLM era. This work offers a thorough exploration of
the field and providing a roadmap for further innovation in LI. The summary of

Result: VolE在多个数据集上表现优异，平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）为2.22%。

Conclusion: VolE在食物体积估计中具有显著优势，适用于医疗营养管理和健康监测。

Abstract: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for medical nutrition management
and health monitoring applications, but current food volume estimation methods
are often limited by mononuclear data, leveraging single-purpose hardware such
as 3D scanners, gathering sensor-oriented information such as depth
information, or relying on camera calibration using a reference object. In this
paper, we present VolE, a novel framework that leverages mobile device-driven
3D reconstruction to estimate food volume. VolE captures images and camera
locations in free motion to generate precise 3D models, thanks to AR-capable
mobile devices. To achieve real-world measurement, VolE is a reference- and
depth-free framework that leverages food video segmentation for food mask
generation. We also introduce a new food dataset encompassing the challenging
scenarios absent in the previous benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
VolE outperforms the existing volume estimation techniques across multiple
datasets by achieving 2.22 % MAPE, highlighting its superior performance in
food volume estimation.

Conclusion: 将MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强集成到nnU-Net训练流程中，为提升医学分割模型的可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets,
leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical
settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data
augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges,
traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness
needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically
evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary
Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations
without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We
demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution
generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of
transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We
quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature
representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we
highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an
easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical
segmentation models in real-world applications.

Conclusion: MTVCrafter为姿势引导的人体视频生成开辟了新方向，显著提升了动画质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly
due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely
largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits
generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.
To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video
Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences
(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT
(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.
Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust
spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image
and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we
introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention
with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as
4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D
world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new
direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our
MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,
surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter
also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple,
full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios. Our video demos and code

Conclusion: ADHMR通过偏好优化和数据清理显著提升了人体网格恢复的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single image is inherently ill-posed due to
depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods have tried to solve this
by generating numerous plausible 3D human mesh predictions, but they often
exhibit misalignment with 2D image observations and weak robustness to
in-the-wild images. To address these issues, we propose ADHMR, a framework that
Aligns a Diffusion-based HMR model in a preference optimization manner. First,
we train a human mesh prediction assessment model, HMR-Scorer, capable of
evaluating predictions even for in-the-wild images without 3D annotations. We
then use HMR-Scorer to create a preference dataset, where each input image has
a pair of winner and loser mesh predictions. This dataset is used to finetune
the base model using direct preference optimization. Moreover, HMR-Scorer also
helps improve existing HMR models by data cleaning, even with fewer training
samples. Extensive experiments show that ADHMR outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at:

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps offer extensive and accurate environmental
information about the driving scene, making them a crucial and essential
element for planning within autonomous driving systems. To avoid extensive
efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have
emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping,
ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance
has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding
temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose
a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used
by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data
from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a
comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike
traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while
remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art online mapping
approaches, achieving improved generalization to previously unseen environments
and sensor configurations. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
highlighting its robustness and applicability in autonomous driving systems.

HandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to
process RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important
sequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal
Pose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition
in a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution
layers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints
coordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint
encoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model
possesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the
ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets. Moreover, the models demonstrate
high performance on the first open dataset for Russian fingerspelling, Znaki,
presented in this paper. The Znaki dataset and HandReader pre-trained models
are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有海洋雾数据集局限于单一区域或卫星，限制了模型在多样化条件下的评估和对海洋雾特性的深入探索。

Method: 构建了MFogHub数据集，整合了15个沿海雾多发区域和6颗地球静止卫星的68,000多个高分辨率样本。

Result: 实验表明，MFogHub能揭示模型因区域和卫星差异导致的泛化波动，并为针对性、可扩展的雾预测技术提供资源。

Conclusion: MFogHub推动了全球范围内海洋雾动态的监测和科学理解，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning approaches for marine fog detection and forecasting have
outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating significant scientific and
practical importance. However, the limited availability of open-source datasets
remains a major challenge. Existing datasets, often focused on a single region
or satellite, restrict the ability to evaluate model performance across diverse
conditions and hinder the exploration of intrinsic marine fog characteristics.
To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MFogHub}, the first
multi-regional and multi-satellite dataset to integrate annotated marine fog
observations from 15 coastal fog-prone regions and six geostationary
satellites, comprising over 68,000 high-resolution samples. By encompassing
diverse regions and satellite perspectives, MFogHub facilitates rigorous
evaluation of both detection and forecasting methods under varying conditions.
Extensive experiments with 16 baseline models demonstrate that MFogHub can
reveal generalization fluctuations due to regional and satellite discrepancy,
while also serving as a valuable resource for the development of targeted and
scalable fog prediction techniques. Through MFogHub, we aim to advance both the
practical monitoring and scientific understanding of marine fog dynamics on a
global scale. The dataset and code are at

*Yue Wang,Shuai Xu,Xuelin Zhu,Yicong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多阶段跨模态交互（MSCI）模型，通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层信息，解决了现有方法在细粒度局部特征捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖CLIP的跨模态对齐能力，但忽视了其在细粒度局部特征捕捉上的局限性。

Method: 设计了两个自适应聚合器，分别从低层和高层视觉特征中提取局部和全局信息，并通过分阶段交互机制将这些信息融入文本表示。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: MSCI模型显著提升了对细粒度局部视觉信息的感知能力，并能灵活适应多样化场景。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object
combinations by leveraging known combinations. Existing studies basically rely
on the cross-modal alignment capabilities of CLIP but tend to overlook its
limitations in capturing fine-grained local features, which arise from its
architectural and training paradigm. To address this issue, we propose a
Multi-Stage Cross-modal Interaction (MSCI) model that effectively explores and
utilizes intermediate-layer information from CLIP's visual encoder.
Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local
information from low-level visual features and integrate global information
from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are
progressively incorporated into textual representations through a
stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's
perception capability for fine-grained local visual information. Additionally,
MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual
information based on different combinations, as well as different elements
within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse
scenarios. Experiments on three widely used datasets fully validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Data and code are
available at https://github.com/ltpwy/MSCI.

TL;DR: 论文提出StoryReasoning数据集和Qwen Storyteller模型，通过视觉相似性和面部识别解决视觉叙事中的角色一致性和幻觉问题，性能提升12.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事系统在跨帧角色一致性和动作与主体关联上存在问题，导致引用幻觉。

Method: 提出StoryReasoning数据集，包含4,178个故事，采用跨帧对象重识别、链式思维推理和视觉实体链接方法。

Result: 微调Qwen2.5-VL 7B模型后，幻觉率从4.06降至3.56（-12.3%）。

Conclusion: 通过视觉实体链接和多帧关系建模，显著减少叙事中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across
frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to
referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of
characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose
StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie
images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story
maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly
modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations.
Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual
similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit
narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to
visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by
fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end
object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining
consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a
reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story when
compared to a non-fine-tuned model.

TL;DR: MIPHEI是一种基于U-Net和ViT的模型，用于从H&E染色图像预测多路免疫荧光（mIF）信号，以低成本实现细胞类型识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决mIF技术因成本高和操作复杂而难以在临床广泛应用的问题，通过H&E图像预测mIF信号。

Method: 采用U-Net架构结合ViT编码器，训练于ORION数据集，并在两个独立数据集上验证。

Result: 模型在多个细胞类型标记上表现优异，如Pan-CK（F1=0.88）、CD3e（F1=0.57），显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MIPHEI为大规模H&E数据的细胞类型分析提供了新途径，有助于研究细胞空间组织与患者预后的关系。

Abstract: Histopathological analysis is a cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, with
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining routinely acquired for every patient to
visualize cell morphology and tissue architecture. On the other hand, multiplex
immunofluorescence (mIF) enables more precise cell type identification via
proteomic markers, but has yet to achieve widespread clinical adoption due to
cost and logistical constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIPHEI
(Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E), a U-Net-inspired
architecture that integrates state-of-the-art ViT foundation models as encoders
to predict mIF signals from H&E images. MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of
markers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid),
epithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using
the publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from
colorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI
achieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of
0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20,
substantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random
classifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively
captures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue
context, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell
types. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis
of large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between
spatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.

Motivation: 自监督学习在利用大量未标记数据方面具有潜力，但也面临隐私问题，尤其是在视觉领域。论文旨在解决在自监督训练方法和细节未知的黑盒场景下进行成员推理的挑战。

Method: 提出PartCrop方法，通过裁剪图像中的部分对象并在表示空间中查询响应，利用模型共享的部分感知能力和训练数据上的更强部分响应。

Result: 实验验证了PartCrop在不同训练协议和结构的自监督模型上的有效性和泛化能力，并评估了三种防御方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PartCrop在成员推理任务中表现优异，同时提出了防御方法和改进版本PartCrop-v2，为自监督学习的隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled
data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision.
In this paper, we perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models
in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are
unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system
in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be
trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image
modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a
unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the
shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the
training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to
query responses within the image in representation space. We conduct extensive
attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and
structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the
effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against
PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential
privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The
defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Finally, besides
prototype testing on toy visual encoders and small-scale image datasets, we
quantitatively study the impacts of scaling from both data and model aspects in
a realistic scenario and propose a scalable PartCrop-v2 by introducing two
structural improvements to PartCrop. Our code is at

Motivation: 现有SNN-based Transformers主要关注单图像任务，未能充分利用SNN在视频任务中的高效性。

Method: 设计了脉冲驱动的Hamming注意力（SDHA），并分析了多种脉冲驱动的时空注意力设计，确定了最优方案。

Conclusion: SpikeVideoFormer在视频任务中表现出色，兼具高性能和高效能，为SNN在视频领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering
superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily
focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively
leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer,
featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design
a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided
adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention.
Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention
designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for
video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The
generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across
diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking,
and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with
over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the
performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency
gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the
three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer

Conclusion: 无配对学习方法在移动设备上具有潜力，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a fundamental component in modern
smartphone cameras responsible for conversion of RAW sensor image data to RGB
images with a strong focus on perceptual quality. Recent work highlights the
potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with
a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and
costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise
aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to
high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by
proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need
for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with
matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function
guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature
maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning
color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using
lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as
backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm
UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning
strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple
evaluation metrics. The code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）对图像中虚拟对象的理解能力，发现现有模型表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否真正理解图像的视觉空间属性，通过虚拟对象的描述测试其场景理解能力。

Method: 提出用虚拟对象（如未在图像中出现的风筝）测试VLMs的场景理解能力，并系统评估了现有模型。

Result: 现有VLMs处理虚拟对象的能力不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在理解虚拟对象和场景空间关系方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are AI systems paired with both language and
vision encoders to process multimodal input. They are capable of performing
complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open
question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes
depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual
objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help
test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that
depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt:
imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should
update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations
between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of
state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is
inadequate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数量-质量权衡上缺乏用户直观调整能力，无法适应多样化的硬件和通信约束需求。

Method: 通过单次训练和用户指定的超参数，自动找到不同场景下的理想数量-质量权衡点。

Result: ControlGS在减少高斯数量的同时保持高质量渲染，优于基线方法，并支持无级调整。

Conclusion: ControlGS提供了一种灵活且高效的数量-质量权衡解决方案，适用于多样场景。

Abstract: To reduce storage and computational costs, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) seeks
to minimize the number of Gaussians used while preserving high rendering
quality, introducing an inherent trade-off between Gaussian quantity and
rendering quality. Existing methods strive for better quantity-quality
performance, but lack the ability for users to intuitively adjust this
trade-off to suit practical needs such as model deployment under diverse
hardware and communication constraints. Here, we present ControlGS, a 3DGS
optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene
consistent quantity-quality control while maintaining strong quantity-quality
performance. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a
user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS
can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across
diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also
outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer
Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the
trade-off.

Conclusion: Logos数据集和提出的方法在跨语言ISLR任务中表现优异，为低资源手语识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition
(ISLR) task. First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the
amount of data for most individual sign languages is limited. It poses the
challenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning.
Second, similar signs can have different semantic meanings. It leads to
ambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for
annotating such signs. To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a
novel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by
the number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the
largest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. It is shown that a model,
pre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other
language SLR tasks, including few-shot learning. We explore cross-language
transfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple
classification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the
most. The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually
similar sign groups. We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs
improves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks. Based
on the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results
for the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a
single stream model processing solely RGB video. The source code, dataset, and
pre-trained models are publicly available.

Conclusion: UniEval为统一多模态模型提供了简化和统一的评估方法，揭示了其独特价值。

Abstract: The emergence of unified multimodal understanding and generation models is
rapidly attracting attention because of their ability to enhance
instruction-following capabilities while minimizing model redundancy. However,
there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would
enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct
evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant
limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation
models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity,
and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework
designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or
annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The
UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both
unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore
metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity.
Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing
benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing
current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual
generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.

Abstract: We introduce CheXGenBench, a rigorous and multifaceted evaluation framework
for synthetic chest radiograph generation that simultaneously assesses
fidelity, privacy risks, and clinical utility across state-of-the-art
text-to-image generative models. Despite rapid advancements in generative AI
for real-world imagery, medical domain evaluations have been hindered by
methodological inconsistencies, outdated architectural comparisons, and
disconnected assessment criteria that rarely address the practical clinical
value of synthetic samples. CheXGenBench overcomes these limitations through
standardised data partitioning and a unified evaluation protocol comprising
over 20 quantitative metrics that systematically analyse generation quality,
potential privacy vulnerabilities, and downstream clinical applicability across
11 leading text-to-image architectures. Our results reveal critical
inefficiencies in the existing evaluation protocols, particularly in assessing
generative fidelity, leading to inconsistent and uninformative comparisons. Our
framework establishes a standardised benchmark for the medical AI community,
enabling objective and reproducible comparisons while facilitating seamless
integration of both existing and future generative models. Additionally, we
release a high-quality, synthetic dataset, SynthCheX-75K, comprising 75K
radiographs generated by the top-performing model (Sana 0.6B) in our benchmark
to support further research in this critical domain. Through CheXGenBench, we

Result: 在公开基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，提升了对抗脸部变形攻击的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法具有普适性，可集成到现有的人脸识别训练流程中，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Face recognition has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep
learning techniques, enabling its widespread adoption in various applications
requiring secure authentication. However, this progress has also increased its
exposure to presentation attacks, including face morphing, which poses a
serious security threat by allowing one identity to impersonate another.
Therefore, modern face recognition systems must be robust against such attacks.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach for training deep networks for face
recognition with enhanced robustness to face morphing attacks. Our method
modifies the classification task by introducing a dual-branch classification
strategy that effectively handles the ambiguity in the labeling of face morphs.
This adaptation allows the model to incorporate morph images into the training
process, improving its ability to distinguish them from bona fide samples.
  Our strategy has been validated on public benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing robustness against face morphing attacks.
Furthermore, our approach is universally applicable and can be integrated into
existing face recognition training pipelines to improve classification-based
recognition methods.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved high performance in
vision-language tasks involving single image but they struggle when presented
with a collection of multiple images (Multiple Image Question Answering
scenario). These tasks, which involve reasoning over large number of images,
present issues in scalability (with increasing number of images) and retrieval
performance. In this work, we propose an enhancement for retriever framework

method leverages query-aware submodular functions, such as GraphCut, to
pre-select a subset of semantically relevant images before main retrieval
component. We demonstrate that using anchor-based queries and augmenting the
data improves submodular-retriever pipeline effectiveness, particularly in
large haystack sizes.

Abstract: Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models
genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit
visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without
fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the
visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing
that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with
the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the
introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a
novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the
model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to
positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our
approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal
scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨合成图像中可行性是否影响CLIP分类器的训练效果。

Method: 提出VariReal管道，通过文本提示生成可行或不可行属性的图像，并测试其对CLIP性能的影响。

Result: 可行性对性能影响极小（<0.3%），且混合可行与不可行图像对性能无显著影响。

Conclusion: 合成图像的可行性对CLIP分类器性能影响有限，无需严格区分。

Abstract: With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in
part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However,
diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in
reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture
artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a
synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic
images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered
infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered
out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a
model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be
excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility
really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is
necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,
focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We
introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to
include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated
by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally
affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference
in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute
matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the
classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in
training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using
purely feasible or infeasible datasets.

Abstract: Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large
Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate
details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving,
hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning.
To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal
alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate
corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two
modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset
with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model,
FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date.
Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures
and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math
instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with
ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on
MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a
new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista,
achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%. The dataset and models will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉标记化方法将标记器优化与下游任务分离，导致视觉标记与目标任务需求不匹配，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: ETT利用视觉嵌入和联合优化目标（重建和字幕），端到端调优视觉标记器，无需修改原始架构。

Result: 实验表明，ETT在多模态理解和视觉生成任务中性能提升2-6%，同时保持原有重建能力。

Conclusion: ETT是一种简单有效的方法，可增强多模态基础模型的性能。

Abstract: Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers
from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize
well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question
answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is
agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.
This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the
vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For
example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when
recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end
vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision
tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive
models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT
leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the
vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.
ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal
architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate,
without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the
employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance
gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks
compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original
reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can
empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and
understanding.

Abstract: This work presents Prior Depth Anything, a framework that combines incomplete
but precise metric information in depth measurement with relative but complete
geometric structures in depth prediction, generating accurate, dense, and
detailed metric depth maps for any scene. To this end, we design a
coarse-to-fine pipeline to progressively integrate the two complementary depth
sources. First, we introduce pixel-level metric alignment and distance-aware
weighting to pre-fill diverse metric priors by explicitly using depth
prediction. It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns,
enhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a
conditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise
of depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and
prediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth
sources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth
completion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets,
matching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly,
it performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time
improvements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models.

Conclusion: 通过整合3D先验，3D-Fixup在复杂编辑任务中表现出色，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models,
3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only
specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a
new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework
supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D
rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses
the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes
real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training
data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a
single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,
we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this
challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We
design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout
training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup
effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving
high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in
realistic image manipulation. The code is provided at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ANN-to-SNN转换方法在处理LLMs时存在激活异常和非线性操作不兼容的问题，需要一种无损转换方法。

Method: LAS引入两种新型神经元，用于转换ANN的激活异常和非线性操作，并定制了脉冲等效的Transformer组件。

Result: 在六种语言模型和两种视觉语言模型上，LAS实现了无损转换，并在OPT-66B上提升了2%的准确率。

Conclusion: LAS是一种高效且无损的ANN-SNN转换方法，适用于脉冲驱动的LLMs。

Abstract: Spiking Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an energy-efficient
alternative to conventional LLMs through their event-driven computation. To
effectively obtain spiking LLMs, researchers develop different ANN-to-SNN
conversion methods by leveraging pre-trained ANN parameters while inheriting
the energy efficiency of SNN. However, existing conversion methods struggle
with extreme activation outliers and incompatible nonlinear operations of
ANN-based LLMs. To address this, we propose a loss-less ANN-SNN conversion for
fully spike-driven LLMs, termed LAS. Specifically, LAS introduces two novel
neurons to convert the activation outlier and nonlinear operation of ANN-based
LLMs. Moreover, LAS tailors the spike-equivalent Transformer components for
spiking LLMs, which can ensure full spiking conversion without any loss of
performance. Experimental results on six language models and two
vision-language models demonstrate that LAS achieves loss-less conversion.
Notably, on OPT-66B, LAS even improves the accuracy of 2\% on the WSC task. In
addition, the parameter and ablation studies further verify the effectiveness
of LAS. The source code is available at https://github.com/lc783/LAS

Motivation: 模拟内存计算（AIMC）在速度和能效上优于传统冯·诺依曼架构，但存在噪声和量化约束问题，导致LLM在4位精度下性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种通用方法，通过训练使LLM适应模拟硬件的噪声和低精度约束，并支持低精度数字硬件的量化推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct和Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct等模型在模拟噪声和量化约束下仍保持4位权重、8位激活的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了高容量LLM与高效模拟硬件之间的鸿沟，为能效优化的基础模型提供了路径。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve
speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of
conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces
fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on
input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions,
off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when
deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated
recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic
method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet
exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly
adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach
enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including
Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain
performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the
presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show
that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can
be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show
that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better
scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input
quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient
analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体协作提供了灵活且理论保证的解决方案，适用于动态网络和复杂任务。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community
structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed
interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and
abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple
overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value
functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized
membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this
structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and
value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring
access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both
transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation,
and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration.
Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function
approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the
first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and
active learning with provable guarantees.

Conclusion: FGU是一种有效的公平图遗忘方法，解决了偏见问题并兼顾隐私与性能。

Abstract: Graph unlearning is a crucial approach for protecting user privacy by erasing
the influence of user data on trained graph models. Recent developments in
graph unlearning methods have primarily focused on maintaining model prediction
performance while removing user information. However, we have observed that
when user information is deleted from the model, the prediction distribution
across different sensitive groups often changes. Furthermore, graph models are
shown to be prone to amplifying biases, making the study of fairness in graph
unlearning particularly important. This raises the question: Does graph
unlearning actually introduce bias? Our findings indicate that the predictions
of post-unlearning models become highly correlated with sensitive attributes,
confirming the introduction of bias in the graph unlearning process. To address
this issue, we propose a fair graph unlearning method, FGU. To guarantee
privacy, FGU trains shard models on partitioned subgraphs, unlearns the
requested data from the corresponding subgraphs, and retrains the shard models
on the modified subgraphs. To ensure fairness, FGU employs a bi-level debiasing
process: it first enables shard-level fairness by incorporating a fairness
regularizer in the shard model retraining, and then achieves global-level
fairness by aligning all shard models to minimize global disparity. Our
experiments demonstrate that FGU achieves superior fairness while maintaining
privacy and accuracy. Additionally, FGU is robust to diverse unlearning
requests, ensuring fairness and utility performance across various data
distributions.

Abstract: While substantial research has been devoted to optimizing model performance,
convergence rates, and communication efficiency, the energy implications of
federated learning (FL) within Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
scenarios are often overlooked in the existing literature. This study examines
the energy consumed during the FL process, focusing on three main
energy-intensive processes: pre-processing, communication, and local learning,
all contributing to the overall energy footprint. We rely on the observation
that device/client selection is crucial for speeding up the convergence of
model training in a distributed AIoT setting and propose two
clustering-informed methods. These clustering solutions are designed to group
AIoT devices with similar label distributions, resulting in clusters composed
of nearly heterogeneous devices. Hence, our methods alleviate the heterogeneity
often encountered in real-world distributed learning applications. Throughout
extensive numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that our clustering
strategies typically achieve high convergence rates while maintaining low
energy consumption when compared to other recent approaches available in the
literature.

Abstract: As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more
capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling
technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and
decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many
scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization
imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While
more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for
homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper
introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the
challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge,
characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and
lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and
asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet
decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We
introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically
infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model
updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's
model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized
training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous
decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network
size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource
requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods
outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and
heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and
reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.

Conclusion: DMNNs在特定约束下可行，但泛化能力有限，混合架构具有潜力。

Abstract: We investigate deep morphological neural networks (DMNNs). We demonstrate
that despite their inherent non-linearity, activations between layers are
essential for DMNNs. We then propose several new architectures for DMNNs, each
with a different constraint on their parameters. For the first (resp. second)
architecture, we work under the constraint that the majority of parameters
(resp. learnable parameters) should be part of morphological operations. We
empirically show that our proposed networks can be successfully trained, and
are more prunable than linear networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to successfully train DMNNs under such constraints, although the
generalization capabilities of our networks remain limited. Finally, we propose
a hybrid network architecture combining linear and morphological layers,
showing empirically that the inclusion of morphological layers significantly
accelerates the convergence of gradient descent with large batches.

Conclusion: 结论强调仅依赖OOD测试不足以验证组合泛化，还需确保算法真正学习了组合特征。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human
and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must
discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output
mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an
intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable
input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act
based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the
task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to
confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data,
it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm
that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by
exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable
by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop
two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be
successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost
perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct
features for compositional generalisation.

datasets. However, data quality issues such as noisy labels, missing classes,
and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This
study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses
data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The
proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise
cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and
robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on
benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant
improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under
varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed
framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial
performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices
while rigorously maintaining data privacy. Our results indicate that this
method effectively mitigates common data quality challenges, providing a
robust, scalable, and privacy compliant solution suitable for diverse
real-world federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of best arm identification for multi-agent
multi-armed bandits. We consider $N$ agents grouped into $M$ clusters, where
each cluster solves a stochastic bandit problem. The mapping between agents and
bandits is a priori unknown. Each bandit is associated with $K$ arms, and the
goal is to identify the best arm for each agent under a $\delta$-probably
correct ($\delta$-PC) framework, while minimizing sample complexity and
communication overhead.
  We propose two novel algorithms: Clustering then Best Arm Identification
(Cl-BAI) and Best Arm Identification then Clustering (BAI-Cl). Cl-BAI uses a
two-phase approach that first clusters agents based on the bandit problems they
are learning, followed by identifying the best arm for each cluster. BAI-Cl
reverses the sequence by identifying the best arms first and then clustering
agents accordingly. Both algorithms leverage the successive elimination
framework to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy.
  We establish $\delta$-PC guarantees for both methods, derive bounds on their
sample complexity, and provide a lower bound for this problem class. Moreover,
when $M$ is small (a constant), we show that the sample complexity of a variant
of BAI-Cl is minimax optimal in an order-wise sense. Experiments on synthetic
and real-world datasets (MovieLens, Yelp) demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed algorithms in terms of sample and communication efficiency,
particularly in settings where $M \ll N$.

Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial
optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP
problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the
black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model
the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the
network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high
temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low
temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and
facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the
temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and
improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard,
the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the
black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under
both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance
against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have made it increasingly difficult to
distinguish real data from model-generated synthetic data. Using synthetic data
for successive training of future model generations creates "self-consuming
loops", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore,
synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on
their preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is
curated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop
drives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those
preferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or
adversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit
malicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this
paper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining
loops with noisy and adversarially curated data. We theoretically analyze the
impact of such noisy data curation on generative models and identify conditions
for the robustness of the retraining process. Building on this analysis, we
design attack algorithms for competitive adversarial scenarios, where a
platform with a limited budget employs malicious users to misalign a rival's
model from actual user preferences. Experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Motivation: 在LLM训练中，检查点数据量巨大且传输耗时，需优化以减少数据量和提高效率。

Method: 通过分析张量数据的可压缩性，结合字节分组和增量差分压缩技术，开发了LMC压缩方案。

Result: LMC比BZ2压缩性能更好，压缩速度快一个数量级，16核并行实现压缩/解压吞吐量达2.78/3.76 GiB/s。

Conclusion: LMC显著减少了CPU资源占用，支持更高频率的检查点，提升了训练效率。

Abstract: During the training of Large Language Models (LLMs), tensor data is
periodically "checkpointed" to persistent storage to allow recovery of work
done in the event of failure. The volume of data that must be copied during
each checkpoint, even when using reduced-precision representations such as
bfloat16, often reaches hundreds of gigabytes. Furthermore, the data must be
moved across a network and written to a storage system before the next epoch
occurs. With a view to ultimately building an optimized checkpointing solution,
this paper presents experimental analysis of checkpoint data used to derive a
design that maximizes the use of lossless compression to reduce the volume of
data. We examine how tensor data and its compressibility evolve during model
training and evaluate the efficacy of existing common off-the-shelf general
purpose compression engines combined with known data optimization techniques
such as byte-grouping and incremental delta compression.
  Leveraging our analysis we have built an effective compression solution,
known as Language Model Compressor (LMC), which is based on byte-grouping and
Huffman encoding. LMC offers more compression performance than the best
alternative (BZ2) but with an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time needed
to perform the compression. We show that a 16-core parallel implementation of
LMC can attain compression and decompression throughput of 2.78 GiB/s and 3.76
GiB/s respectively. This increase in performance ultimately reduces the CPU
resources needed and provides more time to copy the data to the storage system
before the next epoch thus allowing for higher-frequency checkpoints.

Abstract: Stroke remains one of the most critical global health challenges, ranking as
the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability
worldwide. This study explores the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms
in predicting stroke risk using demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data from

demonstrate that while these models achieve high accuracy, sensitivity remains
a limiting factor for real-world clinical applications. In addition, we

improve machine learning-based stroke prediction. These findings contribute to
the development of more reliable and interpretable models for the early
assessment of stroke risk.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them
systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full
potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search
for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to
optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's
vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be
inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections
to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully
utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an
intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the
Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always
stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique
and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several
widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using
five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that
the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to
three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques. The source code for our
implementation is available at:

Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal
processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean
domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are
unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing
interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across
different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are
still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth
signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product
models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder
constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,
we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide
theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm
is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's
efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in
classification problems - have long been essential tools for quantifying
uncertainty and disorder in data and developing artificial intelligence
algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has
introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous
datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory
into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more
effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a
zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy
and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of
multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture
to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse
datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and
energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization
capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives.
As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy
landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material
behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the
temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for
data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as
a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems

Result: 高环境稳定性显著促进IWL，高线索可靠性增强ICL；学习动态显示任务依赖性，支持相对成本假说。

Conclusion: 可预测性是决定Transformer学习模式的关键因素，研究结果为理解ICL和指导训练方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL),
encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting
flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the
interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary
biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,
adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and
phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to
environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability
dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic
encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We
experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and
systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in
Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high
environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp
transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL
efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics
reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift
occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we
demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL
acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding
to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for
explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a
critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering
novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.

Conclusion: BINGO为AI发展提供了一种更可持续的路径，避免了模型规模的无限增长。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning has increased
exponentially. Models are far more complex than ever before, growing to
gargantuan sizes and housing millions of weights. Unfortunately, the fact that
large models have become the state of the art means that it often costs
millions of dollars to train and operate them. These expenses not only hurt
companies but also bar non-wealthy individuals from contributing to new
developments and force consumers to pay greater prices for AI. Current methods
used to prune models, such as iterative magnitude pruning, have shown great
accuracy but require an iterative training sequence that is incredibly
computationally and environmentally taxing. To solve this problem, BINGO is
introduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a
neural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight
plays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done,
BINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for
insignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an
accuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive
than current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to
mean model growth, as well.

Conclusion: KQT-EWMA是一种灵活、实用且高效的非参数化变化检测方法。

Abstract: We present Kernel-QuantTree Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (KQT-EWMA),
a non-parametric change-detection algorithm that combines the Kernel-QuantTree
(KQT) histogram and the EWMA statistic to monitor multivariate data streams
online. The resulting monitoring scheme is very flexible, since histograms can
be used to model any stationary distribution, and practical, since the
distribution of test statistics does not depend on the distribution of
datastream in stationary conditions (non-parametric monitoring). KQT-EWMA
enables controlling false alarms by operating at a pre-determined Average Run
Length ($ARL_0$), which measures the expected number of stationary samples to
be monitored before triggering a false alarm. The latter peculiarity is in
contrast with most non-parametric change-detection tests, which rarely can
control the $ARL_0$ a priori. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that KQT-EWMA can control $ARL_0$ while achieving
detection delays comparable to or lower than state-of-the-art methods designed
to work in the same conditions.

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类行为和自动化决策方面有潜力，但需改进复杂环境下的适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate
human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question
is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and
can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the
exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic
decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB)
tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct
a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms.
We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents
and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and
reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning
shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random
and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs
exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans.
However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match
human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite
achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the
promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for
automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.

Abstract: The introduction of multimodal models is a huge step forward in Artificial
Intelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities:
text, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these
breakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of
adversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit
vulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat
amplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or
across these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types
remains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners
adopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications,
it's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive
actions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial
attacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This
survey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how
multimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the
multimodal world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着健康食品需求增长，农产品价格预测日益重要，但传统模型难以处理非线性动态数据。

Method: 采用TCN提取时序特征，MLP处理非线性交互，注意力机制动态加权特征，使用美国2015-2018年哈斯鳄梨销售数据进行训练。

Conclusion: 该研究为农业市场时间序列预测提供了可扩展的有效方法，对智能供应链管理和价格策略优化有重要价值。

Abstract: With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price
forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value
crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as
seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle
with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid
deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer
Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for
dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass
avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as
sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected
from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic
preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization,
the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate
that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance,
with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods.
This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series
forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for
intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.

Method: 通过分析得分函数在切向和法向的奇异性结构，提出了Niso-DM（引入非各向同性噪声）和Tango-DM（仅训练切向得分函数）两种方法。

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在复杂几何流形上的分布采样中表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缓解了得分函数的奇异性，显著提高了流形约束数据的采样精度。

Abstract: Euclidean diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative
modeling across diverse domains, and they have been extended to manifold case
in recent advances. Instead of explicitly utilizing the structure of special
manifolds as studied in previous works, we investigate direct sampling of the
Euclidean diffusion models for general manifold-constrained data in this paper.
We reveal the multiscale singularity of the score function in the embedded
space of manifold, which hinders the accuracy of diffusion-generated samples.
We then present an elaborate theoretical analysis of the singularity structure
of the score function by separating it along the tangential and normal
directions of the manifold. To mitigate the singularity and improve the
sampling accuracy, we propose two novel methods: (1) Niso-DM, which introduces
non-isotropic noise along the normal direction to reduce scale discrepancies,
and (2) Tango-DM, which trains only the tangential component of the score
function using a tangential-only loss function. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our methods achieve superior performance on distributions over
various manifolds with complex geometries.

Motivation: 现有离线异常检测方法在流数据场景下不实用，而在线方法通常依赖定期重新训练。

Method: 提出Online-iForest，直接适应流数据生成过程的变化。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，性能与在线方法相当，接近离线方法，且效率更高。

Conclusion: Online-iForest在需要快速检测异常的应用中（如网络安全、欺诈检测）具有潜力。

Abstract: The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which
require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions
when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods
also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic
retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel
method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the
data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on
real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online
alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection
techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest
consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a
promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of
primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种交互式持续学习范式RiCL，通过实时人类反馈动态学习新技能，同时保留旧知识，解决了传统持续学习中数据静态和标签噪声的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习依赖静态数据集和干净标签，而现实交互中数据是动态且噪声较多。RiCL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RiCL结合了时间一致性感知净化器、交互感知直接偏好优化策略和抗噪声对比学习模块。

Result: 在FewRel和TACRED数据集上，RiCL显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RiCL为动态、噪声环境下的持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI
models dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while
retaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major
limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using
streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with
fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling
the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems,
we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from
dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal
consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in
data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to
align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and
human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that
captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus
avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise
patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing
combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label
learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法和机器学习模型难以捕捉事故中复杂因素的交互作用，因此研究探索LLM在事故原因分析中的应用。

Method: 通过226项高速公路事故研究构建数据集，使用QLoRA微调Llama3 8B模型，进行零样本分类分析事故原因。

Result: 模型能有效识别酒驾、超速等主要原因，结合事件数据（如道路维护）提供更深入见解，专家问卷验证其88.89%的实用性。

Conclusion: LLM为交通事故分析提供了全面工具，为政策制定者提供了有价值的见解和潜在对策。

Abstract: Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing
strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical
methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex
interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each
crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway
crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226
traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset
encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was
created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its
understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in
these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash
causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing
comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable
and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively
identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,
aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as
road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical
applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated
by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety,
as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the
complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive
analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it
provides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and
policymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety
practices.

Motivation: 研究长期持续学习（CL）中灾难性遗忘的问题，探索现有CL方法在长期任务中的表现，并提出改进方案。

Method: 提出Long-CL框架，包括任务核心记忆管理策略和长期记忆巩固机制，并构建了两个多模态和文本基准测试集。

Result: Long-CL在两个基准测试集上的性能分别比现有最佳方法提高了7.4%和6.5%。

Conclusion: Long-CL框架有效解决了长期持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a long-term continual learning (CL) task, where a
model learns sequentially from a stream of vast tasks over time, acquiring new
knowledge while retaining previously learned information in a manner akin to
human learning. Unlike traditional CL settings, long-term CL involves handling
a significantly larger number of tasks, which exacerbates the issue of
catastrophic forgetting. Our work seeks to address two critical questions: 1)
How do existing CL methods perform in the context of long-term CL? and 2) How
can we mitigate the catastrophic forgetting that arises from prolonged
sequential updates? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework
inspired by human memory mechanisms for long-term continual learning (Long-CL).
Specifically, we introduce a task-core memory management strategy to
efficiently index crucial memories and adaptively update them as learning
progresses. Additionally, we develop a long-term memory consolidation mechanism
that selectively retains hard and discriminative samples, ensuring robust
knowledge retention. To facilitate research in this area, we construct and
release two multi-modal and textual benchmarks, MMLongCL-Bench and
TextLongCL-Bench, providing a valuable resource for evaluating long-term CL
approaches. Experimental results show that Long-CL outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art by 7.4\% and 6.5\% AP on the two benchmarks, respectively,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: TransPL是一种新的无监督领域自适应方法，通过建模源域的联合分布并使用贝叶斯规则生成伪标签，显著提升了时间序列数据的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪标签策略无法捕捉时间序列数据中的时间模式和通道间变化，导致伪标签质量不佳。

Method: 通过向量量化时间序列块构建代码转移矩阵，利用贝叶斯规则进行目标域适应，生成基于通道加权类条件似然的伪标签。

Result: 在四个时间序列UDA基准测试中，TransPL显著优于现有方法（准确率提升6.1%，F1分数提升4.9%）。

Conclusion: TransPL不仅性能优越，还提供了可解释的领域适应过程，适用于多种UDA场景。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for time series data remains a critical
challenge in deep learning, with traditional pseudo-labeling strategies failing
to capture temporal patterns and channel-wise shifts between domains, producing
sub-optimal pseudo-labels. As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that
addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X},
y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are
derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method
constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source
domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating
pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods.
TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions
and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards
different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable
pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive
analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1%
accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable
insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition
matrices.

Method: 提出FedRAG框架，学习客户端的状态投影函数并在中央服务器聚合参数。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite上实验验证了有效性。

Conclusion: FedRAG在不共享敏感信息的情况下为客户端提供信息增益。

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) methods usually share the encrypted
local state or policy information and help each client to learn from others
while preserving everyone's privacy. In this work, we propose that sharing the
approximated behavior metric-based state projection function is a promising way
to enhance the performance of FRL and concurrently provides an effective
protection of sensitive information. We introduce FedRAG, a FRL framework to
learn a computationally practical projection function of states for each client
and aggregating the parameters of projection functions at a central server. The
FedRAG approach shares no sensitive task-specific information, yet provides
information gain for each client. We conduct extensive experiments on the
DeepMind Control Suite to demonstrate insightful results.

Abstract: Designing a 6G-oriented universal model capable of processing multi-modal

provides robust contextual comprehension and generalization capabilities, while
a fine-tuning approach is adopted to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To
enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and
learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract
universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and

Method: 提出了两种算法：一种将问题简化为DR折扣马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），另一种通过引入锚定状态来稳定不确定性集合内的控制转移核。

Result: 在名义MDP均匀遍历的假设下，两种算法在KL和f_k-散度不确定性集合下，均实现了样本复杂度为Õ(|S||A|t_mix²ε⁻²)的收敛。

Conclusion: 这是首次为DR平均奖励强化学习提供有限样本收敛保证的研究，并通过数值实验验证了算法的收敛速率。

Abstract: Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is
critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the
problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning.
We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The
first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP),
while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state
to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set.
Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms
attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}|
t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as
well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based
uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here,
$\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote
the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing
time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence
guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the
convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 需改进算法以更好利用LLM虚拟经验，未来研究方向包括虚拟经验利用、快速在线适应和多模态任务扩展。

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on
extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While
recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this
limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for
mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the
lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench,
the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that
leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of
ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and
LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering
locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural
language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate
language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of
state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying
existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks,
achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method
training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for
algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally,
we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization
of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and
extension to multi-modal tasks. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 在基因表达和药物响应数据集上，QHML模型在优化归一化后表现优于经典深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子计算机在生物医学数据分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum-classical Hybrid Machine Learning (QHML) models are recognized for
their robust performance and high generalization ability even for relatively
small datasets. These qualities offer unique advantages for anti-cancer drug
response prediction, where the number of available samples is typically small.
However, such hybrid models appear to be very sensitive to the data encoding
used at the interface of a neural network and a quantum circuit, with
suboptimal choices leading to stability issues. To address this problem, we
propose a novel strategy that uses a normalization function based on a
moderated gradient version of the $\tanh$. This method transforms the outputs
of the neural networks without concentrating them at the extreme value ranges.
Our idea was evaluated on a dataset of gene expression and drug response
measurements for various cancer cell lines, where we compared the prediction
performance of a classical deep learning model and several QHML models. These
results confirmed that QHML performed better than the classical models when
data was optimally normalized. This study opens up new possibilities for
biomedical data analysis using quantum computers.

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了电路完整性问题，为电路发现提供了新方法，并揭示了逻辑门在模型中的行为特性。

Abstract: Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for
mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also
garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not
guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across
different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of
incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which
are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To
this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and
ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical
gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements
necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a
framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which
can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without
significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of
fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit.
In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability
to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this
framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as
their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave
among the functionalities of language models.

Conclusion: IPAL通过结合图结构信息和原型对比学习，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，为持续图学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) endure catastrophic forgetting, undermining their
capacity to preserve previously acquired knowledge amid the assimilation of
novel information. Rehearsal-based techniques revisit historical examples,
adopted as a principal strategy to alleviate this phenomenon. However, memory
explosion and privacy infringements impose significant constraints on their
utility. Non-Exemplar methods circumvent the prior issues through Prototype
Replay (PR), yet feature drift presents new challenges. In this paper, our
empirical findings reveal that Prototype Contrastive Learning (PCL) exhibits
less pronounced drift than conventional PR. Drawing upon PCL, we propose
Instance-Prototype Affinity Learning (IPAL), a novel paradigm for Non-Exemplar
Continual Graph Learning (NECGL). Exploiting graph structural information, we
formulate Topology-Integrated Gaussian Prototypes (TIGP), guiding feature
distributions towards high-impact nodes to augment the model's capacity for
assimilating new knowledge. Instance-Prototype Affinity Distillation (IPAD)
safeguards task memory by regularizing discontinuities in class relationships.
Moreover, we embed a Decision Boundary Perception (DBP) mechanism within PCL,
fostering greater inter-class discriminability. Evaluations on four node
classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a better trade-off between
plasticity and stability.

*Fahad Almalki,Mehedi Masud*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合梯度提升模型和XAI技术的欺诈检测框架，实现了高准确性和模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在追求预测准确性时牺牲了透明度和可解释性，难以满足监管要求和赢得利益相关者信任。

Method: 使用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost的堆叠集成模型，并应用SHAP、LIME、PDP和PFI等XAI技术增强可解释性。

Result: 在IEEE-CIS欺诈检测数据集上，模型准确率达99%，AUC-ROC为0.99，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 高预测准确性与透明可解释性可以结合，为金融欺诈检测提供更道德和可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models often prioritize predictive accuracy,
often at the expense of model transparency and interpretability. The lack of
transparency makes it difficult for organizations to comply with regulatory
requirements and gain stakeholders trust. In this research, we propose a fraud
detection framework that combines a stacking ensemble of well-known gradient
boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are used to enhance the transparency
and interpretability of the model's decisions. We used SHAP (SHapley Additive
Explanations) for feature selection to identify the most important features.
Further efforts were made to explain the model's predictions using Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME), Partial Dependence Plots
(PDP), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI). The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection
dataset, which includes more than 590,000 real transaction records, was used to
evaluate the proposed model. The model achieved a high performance with an
accuracy of 99% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.99, outperforming several recent
related approaches. These results indicate that combining high prediction
accuracy with transparent interpretability is possible and could lead to a more
ethical and trustworthy solution in financial fraud detection.

Result: 在Cityscapes和NYU-v2等数据集上，方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 自适应蒸馏与知识轨迹设计有效提升了多任务联合建模的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Depth estimation and scene segmentation are two important tasks in
intelligent transportation systems. A joint modeling of these two tasks will
reduce the requirement for both the storage and training efforts. This work
explores how the multi-task distillation could be used to improve such unified
modeling. While existing solutions transfer multiple teachers' knowledge in a
static way, we propose a self-adaptive distillation method that can dynamically
adjust the knowledge amount from each teacher according to the student's
current learning ability. Furthermore, as multiple teachers exist, the
student's gradient update direction in the distillation is more prone to be
erroneous where knowledge forgetting may occur. To avoid this, we propose a
knowledge trajectory to record the most essential information that a model has
learnt in the past, based on which a trajectory-based distillation loss is
designed to guide the student to follow the learning curve similarly in a
cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarking datasets
including Cityscapes and NYU-v2. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions,
our method achieves a clearly improvement. The code is provided in the
supplementary materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ChronoSteer的多模态时间序列预测框架，通过结合大型语言模型（LLM）和时间序列基础模型（TSFM）的优势，利用文本和时间序列数据提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测方法仅依赖单模态时间序列数据，无法充分利用丰富的文本信息。结合LLM和TSFM的能力，构建多模态模型成为关键挑战。

Method: 提出解耦框架：LLM将文本事件转化为修订指令，指导TSFM输出。引入ChronoSteer模型，并通过两阶段训练策略解决跨模态数据稀缺问题。

Result: ChronoSteer在合成数据训练后，预测准确率比单模态基线提升25.7%，比现有最佳多模态方法提升22.5%。

Conclusion: ChronoSteer成功整合LLM和TSFM，显著提升预测性能，并构建了高质量多模态基准数据集。

Abstract: Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting
their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated
powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively.
Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that
concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future
inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity
of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is
employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then
used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce
ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision
instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the
shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage
training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a
high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the
information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM,
ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7%
improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a
22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MiCo的分层语言代理框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）设计启发式方法，解决云服务中的在线动态多维装箱问题（ODMBP）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法难以适应实时变化，启发式方法策略僵化，现有学习方法缺乏通用性和可解释性。

Method: 将ODMBP建模为半马尔可夫决策过程（SMDP-Option），采用两阶段架构（Option Miner和Option Composer），利用LLM生成策略。

Result: 在超过10,000台虚拟机的场景中，MiCo达到96.9%的竞争比，且在非稳态请求流和多样化配置下表现优异。

Conclusion: MiCo在复杂和大规模云环境中表现出高效性和适应性。

Abstract: In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online
Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by
large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization
methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed
heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based
methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named
MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design
paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov
Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling
through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer.
Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware
strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer
employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the
non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on
real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\%
competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual
machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows
and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and
large-scale cloud environments.

Abstract: Injecting rule-based models like Random Forests into differentiable neural
network frameworks remains an open challenge in machine learning. Recent
advancements have demonstrated that pretrained models can generate efficient
molecular embeddings. However, these approaches often require extensive
pretraining and additional techniques, such as incorporating posterior
probabilities, to boost performance. In our study, we propose a novel strategy
that jointly trains a single Graph Transformer neural network on both sparse
multitask molecular property experimental targets and synthetic targets derived
from XGBoost models trained on Osmordred molecular descriptors. These synthetic
tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and
significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction
tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms
the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task
augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in
multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection
or pretraining.

Conclusion: 提升本地模型适应性是优化联邦学习全局模型性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Federated learning enables the clients to collaboratively train a global
model, which is aggregated from local models. Due to the heterogeneous data
distributions over clients and data privacy in federated learning, it is
difficult to train local models to achieve a well-performed global model. In
this paper, we introduce the adaptability of local models, i.e., the average
performance of local models on data distributions over clients, and enhance the
performance of the global model by improving the adaptability of local models.
Since each client does not know the data distributions over other clients, the
adaptability of the local model cannot be directly optimized. First, we provide
the property of an appropriate local model which has good adaptability on the
data distributions over clients. Then, we formalize the property into the local
training objective with a constraint and propose a feasible solution to train
the local model. Extensive experiments on federated learning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adaptability of local
models and achieves a well-performed global model that consistently outperforms
the baseline methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training while ensuring data
privacy across distributed edge devices, making it a popular solution for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL faces significant challenges due to
statistical heterogeneity, particularly domain heterogeneity, which impedes the
global mode's convergence. In this study, we introduce a new framework to
address this challenge by improving the generalization ability of the FL global
model under domain heterogeneity, using prototype augmentation. Specifically,
we introduce FedAPC (Federated Augmented Prototype Contrastive Learning), a
prototype-based FL framework designed to enhance feature diversity and model
robustness. FedAPC leverages prototypes derived from the mean features of
augmented data to capture richer representations. By aligning local features
with global prototypes, we enable the model to learn meaningful semantic
features while reducing overfitting to any specific domain. Experimental
results on the Office-10 and Digits datasets illustrate that our framework
outperforms SOTA baselines, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: QuXAI框架提升了HQML模型的解释性和可靠性，为量子增强AI技术的安全应用提供了支持。

Abstract: The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models
opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental
complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency
and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in
its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local
explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ
quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus
of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an
explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model
entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use
of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum
transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result
shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as
well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI
techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more
significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY.
The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route
to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting
greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use
of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，ALinear以不到1%的参数数量优于大规模模型，并在不同预测范围内保持高精度。

Conclusion: 挑战了‘模型越大越好’的普遍观念，提倡更高效的时间序列建模范式。

Abstract: Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series
forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent
architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have
often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is
this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law
in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight
forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level
parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that
dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths,
alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable
prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational
overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models
while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy
across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly
evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric
that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our
analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components
varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern,
validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the
prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a
paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.

Conclusion: 合成数据可替代真实数据用于开发鲁棒的机器学习模型。

Abstract: In the photolithographic process vital to semiconductor manufacturing,
various types of defects appear during EUV pattering. Due to ever-shrinking
pattern size, these defects are extremely small and cause false or missed
detection during inspection. Specifically, the lack of defect-annotated quality
data with good representation of smaller defects has prohibited deployment of
deep learning based defect detection models in fabrication lines. To resolve
the problem of data unavailability, we artificially generate scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of line patterns with known distribution of defects and
autonomously annotate them. We then employ state-of-the-art object detection
models to investigate defect detection performance as a function of defect
size, much smaller than the pitch width. We find that the real-time object
detector YOLOv8 has the best mean average precision of 96% as compared to
EfficientNet, 83%, and SSD, 77%, with the ability to detect smaller defects. We
report the smallest defect size that can be detected reliably. When tested on
real SEM data, the YOLOv8 model correctly detected 84.6% of Bridge defects and
78.3% of Break defects across all relevant instances. These promising results
suggest that synthetic data can be used as an alternative to real-world data in
order to develop robust machine-learning models.

Abstract: Monitoring feeding behaviour is a relevant task for efficient herd management
and the effective use of available resources in grazing cattle. The ability to
automatically recognise animals' feeding activities through the identification
of specific jaw movements allows for the improvement of diet formulation, as
well as early detection of metabolic problems and symptoms of animal
discomfort, among other benefits. The use of sensors to obtain signals for such
monitoring has become popular in the last two decades. The most frequently
employed sensors include accelerometers, microphones, and cameras, each with
its own set of advantages and drawbacks. An unexplored aspect is the
simultaneous use of multiple sensors with the aim of combining signals in order
to enhance the precision of the estimations. In this direction, this work
introduces a deep neural network based on the fusion of acoustic and inertial
signals, composed of convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers. The main
advantage of this model is the combination of signals through the automatic
extraction of features independently from each of them. The model has emerged
from an exploration and comparison of different neural network architectures
proposed in this work, which carry out information fusion at different levels.
Feature-level fusion has outperformed data and decision-level fusion by at
least a 0.14 based on the F1-score metric. Moreover, a comparison with
state-of-the-art machine learning methods is presented, including traditional
and deep learning approaches. The proposed model yielded an F1-score value of
0.802, representing a 14% increase compared to previous methods. Finally,
results from an ablation study and post-training quantization evaluation are
also reported.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a
growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities
beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain
knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in
time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as
energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses
LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting
accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series
dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary
information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly
outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and
generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer
strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting
tasks.

Conclusion: ComplexFormer提供了一种更具表达力和适应性的注意力机制，参数效率高，性能优于现有基线模型。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on self-attention to capture token dependencies but
face challenges in effectively integrating positional information while
allowing multi-head attention (MHA) flexibility. Prior methods often model
semantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional
adjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity. This
paper introduces ComplexFormer, featuring Complex Multi-Head Attention-CMHA.
CMHA empowers each head to independently model semantic and positional
differences unified within the complex plane, representing interactions as
rotations and scaling. ComplexFormer incorporates two key improvements: (1) a
per-head Euler transformation, converting real-valued query/key projections
into polar-form complex vectors for head-specific complex subspace operation;
and (2) a per-head adaptive differential rotation mechanism,
exp[i(Adapt(ASmn,i) + Delta(Pmn),i)], allowing each head to learn distinct
strategies for integrating semantic angle differences (ASmn,i) with relative
positional encodings (Delta(Pmn),i). Extensive experiments on language
modeling, text generation, code generation, and mathematical reasoning show
ComplexFormer achieves superior performance, significantly lower generation
perplexity , and improved long-context coherence compared to strong baselines
like RoPE-Transformers. ComplexFormer demonstrates strong parameter efficiency,
offering a more expressive, adaptable attention mechanism.

Conclusion: SpecOffload通过推测解码和卸载的结合，以近乎零额外成本显著加速推理。

Abstract: Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant
challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory,
existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O
overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1)
GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be
loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its
capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose
SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative
decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for
storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus
accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we
carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in
speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于深度强化学习（DRL）的电动巴士充电调度问题，提出了一种分层DRL方法（HDRL），通过将原始MDP分解为高层SMDP和多个低层MDP，解决了长程多阶段规划和稀疏奖励的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动巴士充电调度问题复杂，传统方法难以处理长程多阶段规划和稀疏奖励的挑战，因此需要一种高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出分层DRL方法（HDRL），将问题分解为高层SMDP和低层MDP，并设计HDDQN-HER算法，分别学习充电目标和充电功率策略。

Result: 实验证明，分层策略的性能与原始MDP的最优策略相当，且通过两阶段学习和HER算法解决了非平稳性和采样效率问题。

Conclusion: HDRL方法有效解决了电动巴士充电调度问题，为复杂决策问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的联邦学习数据重构攻击方法，克服了现有方法的局限性，能够完美恢复任意大规模数据批次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护数据隐私，但存在中央服务器通过操纵模型更新重构客户端私有数据的漏洞。现有攻击方法依赖数据分布假设或效率低。

Method: 利用全连接层的新几何视角，设计恶意模型参数，无需客户端数据先验知识即可重构数据。

Result: 在图像和表格数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能完美重构比现有技术大两个数量级的数据批次。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了数据重构攻击的能力，揭示了联邦学习中的潜在隐私风险。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning
models across distributed clients without sharing raw data, ostensibly
preserving data privacy. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical
vulnerabilities in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate
model updates to reconstruct clients' private training data. Existing data
reconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on
assumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency
significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.
  In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes
these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully
connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect
recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any
prior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image
and tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing
methods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of
magnitude larger than the state of the art.

Result: 证明该学习规则能最终识别出活性最高的突触前神经元。

Conclusion: 揭示了Hebbian时序依赖可塑性规则与噪声镜像下降的内在联系，为理解生物神经网络学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a key principle underlying learning in biological neural
networks. It postulates that synaptic changes occur locally, depending on the
activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian learning based on
neuronal firing rates is well explored, much less is known about learning rules
that account for precise spike-timing. We relate a Hebbian
spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect
to a natural loss function on the probability simplex. This connection allows
us to prove that the learning rule eventually identifies the presynaptic neuron
with the highest activity. We also discover an intrinsic connection to noisy
mirror descent.

Conclusion: DAC-MAPPO-E有效解决了EB充电调度的复杂性和可扩展性问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step
toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems,
charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on
real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical
challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and
fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities,
charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales
and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the
original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these
MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL
algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic
(DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at
both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor
network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state
information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low
level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is
incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated
charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing
convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the
superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet
charging schedules.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中因异构设备和非独立同分布数据导致的后门攻击检测难题。

Method: 利用跨客户端注意力机制和特征表示重建误差计算异常分数，区分恶意客户端。

Result: 在不同联邦学习场景下表现鲁棒，显著降低后门攻击成功率，同时保持主任务高准确率。

Conclusion: FeRA是一种模型无关、攻击无关且无需标记数据的防御方法，适合资源受限的边缘部署。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy and reduces communication cost for
resource-constrained edge clients by supporting distributed model training at
the edge. However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse,
non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the
detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a
novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA,
that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to
distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based
on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose
internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our
evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios,
including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices.
Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success
rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is
model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data,
making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.

Conclusion: NML-GCL有效解决了假阴性问题，提升了GCL在下游任务中的性能。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) often suffers from false negatives, which
degrades the performance on downstream tasks. The existing methods addressing
the false negative issue usually rely on human prior knowledge, still leading
GCL to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Negative Metric
Learning (NML) enhanced GCL (NML-GCL). NML-GCL employs a learnable Negative
Metric Network (NMN) to build a negative metric space, in which false negatives
can be distinguished better from true negatives based on their distance to
anchor node. To overcome the lack of explicit supervision signals for NML, we
propose a joint training scheme with bi-level optimization objective, which
implicitly utilizes the self-supervision signals to iteratively optimize the
encoder and the negative metric network. The solid theoretical analysis and the
extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: ADSGD因其简单性、高效性和对延迟的鲁棒性，非常适合实际去中心化学习任务。

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become vital for leveraging distributed data
without central control, enhancing scalability and privacy. However, practical
deployments face fundamental challenges due to heterogeneous computation speeds
and unpredictable communication delays. This paper introduces a refined model
of Asynchronous Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADSGD) under
practical assumptions of bounded computation and communication times. To
understand the convergence of ADSGD, we first analyze Asynchronous Stochastic
Block Coordinate Descent (ASBCD) as a tool, and then show that ADSGD converges
under computation-delay-independent step sizes. The convergence result is
established without assuming bounded data heterogeneity. Empirical experiments
reveal that ADSGD outperforms existing methods in wall-clock convergence time
across various scenarios. With its simplicity, efficiency in memory and
communication, and resilience to communication and computation delays, ADSGD is
well-suited for real-world decentralized learning tasks.

Abstract: AI is foreseen to be a centerpiece in next generation wireless networks

Result: 研究表明这两种能力能帮助RL代理在部署时高效适应环境变化。

Conclusion: 高效在线适应需要优先探索和选择性知识保留，以平衡新知识学习和已有知识保护。

Abstract: Real-world autonomous decision-making systems, from robots to recommendation
engines, must operate in environments that change over time. While deep
reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal
policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume
a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result,
conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a
fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when
encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without
catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation
demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities:
(1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and
learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior
knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without
disruption to reusable components.

Abstract: Randomness is ubiquitous in many applications across data science and machine
learning. Remarkably, systems composed of random components often display
emergent global behaviors that appear deterministic, manifesting a transition
from microscopic disorder to macroscopic organization. In this work, we
introduce a theoretical model for studying the emergence of collective
behaviors in ensembles of random classifiers. We argue that, if the ensemble is
weighted through the Gibbs measure defined by adopting the classification loss
as an energy, then there exists a finite temperature parameter for the
distribution such that the classification is optimal, with respect to the loss
(or the energy). Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by
a Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher
perceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal
temperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by
construction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random
classifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior.
Experiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in
high-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to
shed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon.

Conclusion: 离散VAEs是传统VAEs的有力扩展，适用于特定数据类型，本文为研究者提供了实用的入门指南。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well-established as a principled approach
to probabilistic unsupervised learning with neural networks. Typically, an
encoder network defines the parameters of a Gaussian distributed latent space
from which we can sample and pass realizations to a decoder network. This model
is trained to reconstruct its inputs and is optimized through the evidence
lower bound. In recent years, discrete latent spaces have grown in popularity,
suggesting that they may be a natural choice for many data modalities (e.g.
text). In this tutorial, we provide a rigorous, yet practical, introduction to
discrete variational autoencoders -- specifically, VAEs in which the latent
space is made up of latent variables that follow a categorical distribution. We
assume only a basic mathematical background with which we carefully derive each
step from first principles. From there, we develop a concrete training recipe
and provide an example implementation, hosted at

Conclusion: SMTOs在多任务学习中仍具优势，但均匀权重在某些场景下是可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) balance task learning in Multi-Task
Learning by addressing issues like conflicting gradients and differing gradient
norms, which hinder equal-weighted task training. However, recent critiques
suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to
SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor
hyperparameter optimization and lack of regularization. In this work, we
evaluate these claims through an extensive empirical evaluation of SMTOs,
including some of the latest methods, on more complex multi-task problems to
clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared
to uniform loss and that fixed weights can achieve competitive performance
compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform
similarly to SMTOs in some instances. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: There are now a multitude of AI-scribing solutions for healthcare promising
the utilization of large language models for ambient documentation. However,
these AI scribes still rely on one-shot, or few-shot prompts for generating
notes after the consultation has ended, employing little to no reasoning. This
risks long notes with an increase in hallucinations, misrepresentation of the
intent of the clinician, and reliance on the proofreading of the clinician to
catch errors. A dangerous combination for patient safety if vigilance is
compromised by workload and fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a method for
extracting salient clinical information in real-time alongside the healthcare
consultation, denoted Facts, and use that information recursively to generate
the final note. The FactsR method results in more accurate and concise notes by
placing the clinician-in-the-loop of note generation, while opening up new use
cases within real-time decision support.

Conclusion: SCGP在提升长距离信息传递的同时，具有低推理延迟、高可扩展性和低内存占用，适用于实时和资源受限场景。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for learning over
graph-structured data, yet their expressive capacity is often hindered by
over-squashing, wherein information from distant nodes is compressed into
fixed-size vectors. Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and
bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid
this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley
graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical
properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory
usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation
(SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features
through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology.
SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space,
improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational
efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification
benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or
exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits
particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures,
offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory
footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained
applications.

Conclusion: SEAL展示了结合NAS和选择性扩展在增量学习中的高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from
a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing
plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge).
Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of
the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static
settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often
rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in
resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based
framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint
data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL
adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary,
based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through
cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component
jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy.
Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively
reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size
compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS
and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental
scenarios.

*Wenhao Ding,Choon Hwai Yap,Kangjun Ji,Simão Castro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AneuG是一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的两阶段颅内动脉瘤（IA）网格生成器，能够生成具有特定形态学测量的IA形状，解决了现有方法无法捕捉真实IA特征和忽略IA囊与母血管关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大型IA图像数据集，现有形状生成方法难以捕捉真实IA特征且无法控制生成特定形态学测量，因此需要一种能够生成生理真实IA网格的模型。

Method: AneuG采用两阶段方法：第一阶段生成低维图谐波变形（GHD）令牌以编码和重建IA囊形状；第二阶段基于GHD令牌生成母血管，并通过生成血管中心线和传播横截面实现。

Result: AneuG能够生成具有特定临床相关形态学测量的IA形状，为研究形状变化和流体动力学影响提供了工具。

Conclusion: AneuG为IA形状生成提供了一种高效且可控的方法，适用于临床研究和血流模拟研究。

Abstract: A generative model for the mesh geometry of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is
crucial for training networks to predict blood flow forces in real time, which
is a key factor affecting disease progression. This need is necessitated by the
absence of a large IA image datasets. Existing shape generation methods
struggle to capture realistic IA features and ignore the relationship between
IA pouches and parent vessels, limiting physiological realism and their
generation cannot be controlled to have specific morphological measurements. We
propose AneuG, a two-stage Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based IA mesh
generator. In the first stage, AneuG generates low-dimensional Graph Harmonic
Deformation (GHD) tokens to encode and reconstruct aneurysm pouch shapes,
constrained to morphing energy statistics truths. GHD enables more accurate
shape encoding than alternatives. In the second stage, AneuG generates parent
vessels conditioned on GHD tokens, by generating vascular centreline and
propagating the cross-section. AneuG's IA shape generation can further be
conditioned to have specific clinically relevant morphological measurements.
This is useful for studies to understand shape variations represented by
clinical measurements, and for flow simulation studies to understand effects of
specific clinical shape parameters on fluid dynamics. Source code and
implementation details are available at

Result: 多机制分解显著提升数据效率，效果优于符号与亚符号学习的差异，接近人类学习水平。

Conclusion: 整合多机制可能是缩小机器学习与人类学习效率差距的关键。

Abstract: Human learning relies on specialization -- distinct cognitive mechanisms
working together to enable rapid learning. In contrast, most modern neural
networks rely on a single mechanism: gradient descent over an objective
function. This raises the question: might human learners' relatively rapid
learning from just tens of examples instead of tens of thousands in data-driven
deep learning arise from our ability to use multiple specialized mechanisms of
learning in combination? We investigate this question through an ablation
analysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring
environments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient
3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning
into multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency,
bringing it in line with human learning. Furthermore, we show that this
decomposition has a greater impact on efficiency than the distinction between
symbolic and subsymbolic learning alone. Efforts to align data-driven machine
learning with human learning often overlook the stark difference in learning
efficiency. Our findings suggest that integrating multiple specialized learning
mechanisms may be key to bridging this gap.

Result: 证明目标函数可用多项式大小的随机特征组合近似，且adc与统计查询维度存在多项式关系。

Conclusion: 揭示了无分布学习的局限性，强调数据分布假设的重要性。

Abstract: We study the relationship between gradient-based optimization of parametric
models (e.g., neural networks) and optimization of linear combinations of
random features. Our main result shows that if a parametric model can be
learned using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (bSGD) without making
assumptions about the data distribution, then with high probability, the target
function can also be approximated using a polynomial-sized combination of
random features. The size of this combination depends on the number of gradient
steps and numerical precision used in the bSGD process. This finding reveals
fundamental limitations of distribution-free learning in neural networks
trained by gradient descent, highlighting why making assumptions about data
distributions is often crucial in practice. Along the way, we also introduce a
new theoretical framework called average probabilistic dimension complexity
(adc), which extends the probabilistic dimension complexity developed by Kamath
et al. (2020). We prove that adc has a polynomial relationship with statistical
query dimension, and use this relationship to demonstrate an infinite
separation between adc and standard dimension complexity.

Conclusion: L2T通过优化推理链，实现了高效且有效的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in
reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between
reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging
unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we
propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement
fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning
with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as
a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense
process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in
parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We
propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and
the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly
reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately
rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T
optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each
episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning
benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different
tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，MASSV在视觉任务中接受长度增加30%，推理速度提升1.46倍。

Conclusion: MASSV为加速当前和未来的视觉语言模型提供了一种可扩展且兼容架构的方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by
enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger
target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to
vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small
language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural
components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match
those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce
Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of
Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models
into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first
connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight
trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning
using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.
Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families
demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers
end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV
provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both
current and future VLMs.

Abstract: Clouds and precipitation are important for understanding weather and climate.
Simulating clouds and precipitation with traditional numerical weather
prediction is challenging because of the sub-grid parameterizations required.
Machine learning has been explored for forecasting clouds and precipitation,
but early machine learning methods often created blurry forecasts. In this
paper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero
to three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and
intuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for
the community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting
geostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of
diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual
correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our
results show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing
clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation.
These results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the
past 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows
the preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a
conventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion
models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion
models, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin
on root mean squared error. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box
ensemble generation, which shows skillful calibration, with the spread of the
ensemble correlating well to the error.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems.
Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires
performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has
to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of
conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally
linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing
identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine
operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using
the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous
part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman
eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using
metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based
eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against
an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear
feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the
eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled
proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control
approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the
optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results
showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark
controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under
sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Conclusion: 表示叠加是神经缩放定律的重要机制，未来可能通过优化训练策略和架构提升性能。

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the
observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this
neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model
size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs
represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,
representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur
with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss
scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only
the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of
loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature
frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong
superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,
the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide
range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is
explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower
dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales
inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced
LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match
the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also
agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an
important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate
that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model
architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer
parameters.

<details>

Motivation: 传统扩展语言模型的方法（参数扩展或推理时扩展）通常需要较高的空间或时间成本，因此需要一种更高效的扩展范式。

Method: 通过并行执行输入的多样化变换和动态聚合输出，实现模型训练和推理时的并行计算扩展（ParScale）。

Result: 实验表明，ParScale在相同性能提升下，内存和延迟开销分别减少了22倍和6倍，并能通过少量后训练将预训练模型转化为并行扩展模型。

Conclusion: ParScale为低资源场景下部署更强大模型提供了新思路，并重新定义了计算在机器学习中的作用。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a
significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter
scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and
more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel
computation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and
learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in
parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely
parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing
parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,
data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it
through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel
streams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\log P)$ while showing
superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\times$
less memory increase and 6$\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter
scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an
off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training
on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new
scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more
powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative
perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.

Result: NCDPO在样本效率和最终性能上优于现有方法，适用于机器人控制和多智能体游戏场景。

Conclusion: NCDPO为扩散策略的强化学习微调提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as
robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills
from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the
sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion
policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures.
While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising
solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to
effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This
challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood
estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated
optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized
policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much
lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies
(MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework
that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy.
By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned
on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and
gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments
demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when
training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency
and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot
control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results
show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the
Diffusion Policy.

Result: QFIX在SMACv2和Overcooked环境中表现优于现有方法，学习更稳定且模型更简单。

Conclusion: QFIX通过简单设计扩展了表示能力，提升了性能，同时保持了模型的简洁性。

Abstract: Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent
utilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action
selection process between individual utilities and joint values remains
consistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the
individual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is
straightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited
representation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM
values, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is
unnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the
full class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a
novel family of value function decomposition models that expand the
representation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin "fixing" layer.
We derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two
well-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on
multiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i)
succeeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably
and performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this
while employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.

Abstract: This paper addresses fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for function
calling tasks when real user interaction data is unavailable. In digital
content creation tools, where users express their needs through natural
language queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world
task-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate
synthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation
fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data
distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We
present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like
content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and
vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training
data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data
generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a
fundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive
set of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function
classification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our
synthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new
benchmarks for function calling tasks.

Abstract: Recently, post hoc explanation methods have emerged to enhance model
transparency by attributing model outputs to input features. However, these
methods face challenges due to their specificity to certain neural network
architectures and data modalities. Existing explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) frameworks have attempted to address these challenges but suffer from
several limitations. These include limited flexibility to diverse model
architectures and data modalities due to hard-coded implementations, a
restricted number of supported XAI methods because of the requirements for
layer-specific operations of attribution methods, and sub-optimal
recommendations of explanations due to the lack of evaluation and optimization
phases. Consequently, these limitations impede the adoption of XAI technology
in real-world applications, making it difficult for practitioners to select the
optimal explanation method for their domain. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{PnPXAI}, a universal XAI framework that supports diverse data
modalities and neural network models in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) manner. PnPXAI
automatically detects model architectures, recommends applicable explanation
methods, and optimizes hyperparameters for optimal explanations. We validate
the framework's effectiveness through user surveys and showcase its versatility
across various domains, including medicine and finance.

the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined
pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff
demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints
compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher
docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design,
without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore
modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and
flexible framework for rational drug design.

Motivation: 空气污染和极端天气事件对健康构成威胁，而个人传感技术的进步为监测和预测健康提供了新机会。

Method: 整合可穿戴设备的生理数据和实时环境暴露数据，使用对抗自编码器神经网络进行预测，并通过迁移学习提高模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, causing or
exacerbating many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, climate
change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and
heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of
pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the
collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for
new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside
new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor
and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel
workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by
integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time
environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure
and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual
health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework.
We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network
in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and
captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using
data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities
of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world,
user-generated data.

Abstract: Beyond neural scaling laws, little is known about the laws underlying large
language models (LLMs). We introduce Neural Thermodynamic Laws (NTL) -- a new
framework that offers fresh insights into LLM training dynamics. On the
theoretical side, we demonstrate that key thermodynamic quantities (e.g.,
temperature, entropy, heat capacity, thermal conduction) and classical
thermodynamic principles (e.g., the three laws of thermodynamics and the
equipartition theorem) naturally emerge under river-valley loss landscape
assumptions. On the practical side, this scientific perspective yields
intuitive guidelines for designing learning rate schedules.

Motivation: 个性化护理和资源高效利用需要有效的患者亚群聚类方法，传统方法在高维异构医疗数据中表现不佳。

Method: 使用LLAMA 3.1 8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B和Stella-En-400M-V5模型生成嵌入，并应用K-means聚类，与传统方法（如K-Medoids）对比。

Result: Stella-En-400M-V5的轮廓分数最高（0.86），LLM方法在更多簇数时表现更好，能识别具有不同特征的亚群。

Conclusion: LLM方法在资源有限的环境中具有潜力，能提供更丰富的上下文信息和关键特征。

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient
resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional,
heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing
richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential
of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in
resource-limited settings.

Result: 替代模型能提前20,000时间步生成配置，计算时间减少约22倍。

Conclusion: DDPM为开发随机生物系统的数字孪生提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to
investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell
resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework
for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally
expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation
of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated
evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic
nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different
model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work,
we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI
surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We
describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that
define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this
classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model
surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference
configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational
time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards
the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological
systems.

TL;DR: LanTu是一种基于动力学增强深度学习的区域涡旋解析海洋预报系统，通过多尺度物理约束优化，显著提升了中尺度涡旋演变的预报能力，优于现有数值和AI预报系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中尺度涡旋对全球海洋能量级联有重要影响，但传统数值模型在涡旋解析预报中面临科学挑战和高计算成本。AI预报系统虽高效，但在复杂多尺度特征下仍存在挑战。

Method: 开发LanTu系统，结合跨尺度相互作用和多尺度物理约束，利用涡旋动力学知识优化模型。

Result: LanTu在温度、盐度、海平面异常和流场预报上优于现有数值和AI系统，预报时效超过10天。

Conclusion: 动力学增强深度学习（LanTu）是中尺度涡旋解析海洋预报的有效范式。

Abstract: Mesoscale eddies dominate the spatiotemporal multiscale variability of the
ocean, and their impact on the energy cascade of the global ocean cannot be
ignored. Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection
for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific
challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are
becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational
efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical
system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting
(especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep
learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct
multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy
dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale
evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced
operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean
forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and
current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights
that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting.

Motivation: 探讨网络中协调与反协调行为的动态及其均衡特性，特别是在存在显著凝聚子集时的表现。

Method: 基于有向符号图模型，结合个体偏置项，分析纳什均衡的存在性与稳定性。

Result: 证明了在特定条件下，纳什均衡的存在性，表现为共识或极化，并具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为协调游戏的鲁棒性提供了理论基础，并扩展了图凝聚性的应用。

Abstract: We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both
coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an
underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight
that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each
agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the
signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario
that assumes the presence of a prominent 'cohesive' subset of players, who are
either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally
balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities
with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the
properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results
guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or,
respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability
under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness
results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a
novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.

Conclusion: 该模型为放疗计划质量教育提供了高效解决方案，填补了当前临床模式的不足。

Abstract: Effective education in radiotherapy plan quality review requires a robust,
regularly updated set of examples and the flexibility to demonstrate multiple
possible planning approaches and their consequences. However, the current
clinic-based paradigm does not support these needs. To address this, we have
developed 'Virtual Dosimetrist' models that can both generate training examples
of suboptimal treatment plans and then allow trainees to improve the plan
quality through simple natural language prompts, as if communicating with a
dosimetrist. The dose generation and modification process is accurate, rapid,
and requires only modest resources. This work is the first to combine dose
distribution prediction with natural language processing; providing a robust
pipeline for both generating suboptimal training plans and allowing trainees to
practice their critical plan review and improvement skills that addresses the
challenges of the current clinic-based paradigm.

Abstract: This paper focuses on explaining the timbre conveyed by speech signals and
introduces a task termed voice timbre attribute detection (vTAD). In this task,
voice timbre is explained with a set of sensory attributes describing its human

compared in a designated timbre descriptor. Moreover, a framework is proposed,
which is built upon the speaker embeddings extracted from the speech
utterances. The investigation is conducted on the VCTK-RVA dataset.
Experimental examinations on the ECAPA-TDNN and FACodec speaker encoders
demonstrated that: 1) the ECAPA-TDNN speaker encoder was more capable in the
seen scenario, where the testing speakers were included in the training set; 2)
the FACodec speaker encoder was superior in the unseen scenario, where the
testing speakers were not part of the training, indicating enhanced

Abstract: Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling
distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to
handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration
of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important
effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking
amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of
ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning
approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used
to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from
data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with
neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical
systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear
vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for
nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily
accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the
network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic
data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained
to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are
presented.

Motivation: 通过深度学习技术改进学前课堂语音分析的准确性和可扩展性，为教育研究和干预策略提供支持。

Method: 整合wav2vec2进行说话者分类，Whisper进行语音转录，并使用235分钟音频数据验证系统性能。

Result: 说话者分类的F1分数为0.845，转录质量中高（教师WER为0.119，儿童为0.238），ICC在0.64到0.98之间。

Conclusion: WSW2.0展示了深度学习在教育研究中的潜力，可支持早期语言发展和干预策略。

Abstract: This paper introduces an automated framework WSW2.0 for analyzing vocal
interactions in preschool classrooms, enhancing both accuracy and scalability
through the integration of wav2vec2-based speaker classification and Whisper
(large-v2 and large-v3) speech transcription. A total of 235 minutes of audio
recordings (160 minutes from 12 children and 75 minutes from 5 teachers), were
used to compare system outputs to expert human annotations. WSW2.0 achieves a
weighted F1 score of .845, accuracy of .846, and an error-corrected kappa of
.672 for speaker classification (child vs. teacher). Transcription quality is
moderate to high with word error rates of .119 for teachers and .238 for
children. WSW2.0 exhibits relatively high absolute agreement intraclass
correlations (ICC) with expert transcriptions for a range of classroom language
features. These include teacher and child mean utterance length, lexical
diversity, question asking, and responses to questions and other utterances,
which show absolute agreement intraclass correlations between .64 and .98. To
establish scalability, we apply the framework to an extensive dataset spanning
two years and over 1,592 hours of classroom audio recordings, demonstrating the
framework's robustness for broad real-world applications. These findings
highlight the potential of deep learning and natural language processing
techniques to revolutionize educational research by providing accurate measures
of key features of preschool classroom speech, ultimately guiding more
effective intervention strategies and supporting early childhood language
development.

Motivation: SNN训练中，替代梯度法的gamma参数选择存在矛盾：大gamma导致过度激活和能耗增加，小gamma引发梯度消失。

Method: 提出了一种基于生物抑制机制的ILIF神经元模型，通过抑制单元调节膜电位和电流，平衡梯度传播与激活控制。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，ILIF有效缓解gamma困境，降低神经元放电率，提升能量效率和模型准确率。

Conclusion: ILIF模型为SNN训练提供了一种高效解决方案，兼具生物合理性和实用性。

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has drawn increasing attention for its
energy-efficient, event-driven processing and biological plausibility. To train
SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the
non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives
within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold,
referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major
challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to
overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn
increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients
and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal
Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological
inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units
for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while
preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF
effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on
multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing
rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy. The code is available at

Result: 方法在1000自旋无序非平衡模型和神经尖峰数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且物理直观，适用于复杂系统EP分析。

Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional
stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with
long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such
systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer
trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a
nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex
duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as
spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of
high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special
assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to
compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from
different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical
interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its
numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins
and a large neural spike-train dataset.

Conclusion: ImplicitStainer为虚拟染色提供了高效、数据需求低的解决方案，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a gold standard for microscopic
diagnosis in pathology. However, H&E staining does not capture all the
diagnostic information that may be needed. To obtain additional molecular
information, immunohistochemical (IHC) stains highlight proteins that mark
specific cell types, such as CD3 for T-cells or CK8/18 for epithelial cells.
While IHC stains are vital for prognosis and treatment guidance, they are
typically only available at specialized centers and time consuming to acquire,
leading to treatment delays for patients. Virtual staining, enabled by deep
learning-based image translation models, provides a promising alternative by
computationally generating IHC stains from H&E stained images. Although many
GAN and diffusion based image to image (I2I) translation methods have been used
for virtual staining, these models treat image patches as independent data
points, which results in increased and more diverse data requirements for
effective generation. We present ImplicitStainer, a novel approach that
leverages local implicit functions to improve image translation, specifically
virtual staining performance, by focusing on pixel-level predictions. This
method enhances robustness to variations in dataset sizes, delivering
high-quality results even with limited data. We validate our approach on two
datasets using a comprehensive set of metrics and benchmark it against over
fifteen state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion based models. Full Code and models
trained will be released publicly via Github upon acceptance.

*Pengfei Yu,Bin Huang,Minghui Zhang,Weiwen Wu,Shaoyu Wang,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有序子集的多扩散模型（OSMM），用于稀疏视图CT重建，通过分块学习和全局约束提升细节重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在稀疏视图CT重建中因数据冗余导致学习效果差，重建图像细节不足。

Method: 将CT投影数据分为子集，采用多子集扩散模型（MSDM）独立学习，并结合全局扩散模型（OWDM）约束信息一致性。

Result: OSMM在图像质量和噪声鲁棒性上优于传统扩散模型，适应不同稀疏程度的CT数据。

Conclusion: OSMM为稀疏视图CT提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have shown significant promise in the field of
sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, the projection dataset is large and
riddled with redundancy. Consequently, applying the diffusion model to
unprocessed data results in lower learning effectiveness and higher learning
difficulty, frequently leading to reconstructed images that lack fine details.
To address these issues, we propose the ordered-subsets multi-diffusion model
(OSMM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The OSMM innovatively divides the CT
projection data into equal subsets and employs multi-subsets diffusion model
(MSDM) to learn from each subset independently. This targeted learning approach
reduces complexity and enhances the reconstruction of fine details.
Furthermore, the integration of one-whole diffusion model (OWDM) with complete
sinogram data acts as a global information constraint, which can reduce the
possibility of generating erroneous or inconsistent sinogram information.
Moreover, the OSMM's unsupervised learning framework provides strong robustness
and generalizability, adapting seamlessly to varying sparsity levels of CT
sinograms. This ensures consistent and reliable performance across different
clinical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OSMM outperforms
traditional diffusion models in terms of image quality and noise resilience,
offering a powerful and versatile solution for advanced CT imaging in
sparse-view scenarios.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合生成语义通信系统（Gen-SemCom），结合文本提示和关键信息嵌入（CIE）框架，以解决纯提示驱动生成丢失细节的问题，并设计了GVIF指标评估系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯提示驱动的生成语义通信会丢失细粒度视觉细节，且缺乏系统性评估指标。

Method: 开发了混合Gen-SemCom系统，结合文本提示和关键特征提取；提出语义过滤方法和GVIF指标；设计自适应控制系统。

Result: GVIF指标对视觉保真度敏感，优化系统在PSNR和FID得分上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 混合Gen-SemCom系统和GVIF指标有效提升了生成图像的视觉质量和系统性能。

Abstract: Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial
intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks,
which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts
rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses
fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic
metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these
issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information
embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical
features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic
filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features
of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and
critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a
diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual
information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the
generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,
the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted
features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we
design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume
of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental
results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating
with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized
system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of
higher PSNR and lower FID scores.

Motivation: 胃癌多模态图像分割面临数据集稀缺和模态不对齐的问题，导致训练资源浪费和准确性下降。

Method: 提出HWA-UNETR框架，采用可学习的窗口聚合层和三元融合机制，动态对齐多模态特征。

Result: 在GCM 2025和BraTS 2021数据集上验证，Dice分数提升1.68%，且具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HWA-UNETR和GCM 2025为胃癌多模态图像分割提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the
context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by
the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to
amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are
constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration,
leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis
accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions:
First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first
large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans,
featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500
patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework
that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to
establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities'
anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba
mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies.
Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021
dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new
approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while
maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via
https://github.com/JeMing-creater/HWA-UNETR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白光内窥镜在检测胃肠道疾病时，组织颜色、纹理和形状的对比度常较微弱，导致漏诊。MLE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MLE结合多光谱漫反射、激光散斑对比成像和光度立体技术，增强组织对比度、量化血流并表征黏膜地形。

Result: MLE在31个息肉成像中，对比度提升约3倍，颜色差异提升5倍，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MLE作为一种新型临床工具，有望显著改善胃肠道成像效果。

Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in
the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual
abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast
of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go
undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser
Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable
spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three
capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral
diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast
imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We
validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical
colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold
improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference
compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal
multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating
into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to
improve gastrointestinal imaging.

Abstract: Dryland vegetation ecosystems are known to be susceptible to critical
transitions between alternative stable states when subjected to external
forcing. Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of
bifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is
characteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and
diverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early
Warning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical
signatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong
predictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a
machine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can
effectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models'
capacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation
transitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase
transitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS
detection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models
can be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is
encoded in spatiotemporal dynamics. A few paradigmatic test systems are used to
illustrate how the capabilities of such models can be probed in a number of
ways, with particular attention to the performances of a number of proposed
statistical indicators for EWS and to the supplementary task of distinguishing
between abrupt and continuous transitions. Results reveal that model
performance often changes dramatically when training and test data sources are
interchanged, which offers new insight into the criteria for model
generalization.

$\mathsf{rank}(Q)\leq r$; and $Q$ minimizes the expected Frobenius norm error
$\mathbb{E}\|P-Q\|_F^2$. Our algorithm mirrors the solution to the efficient

Conclusion: pc-dbCBS是一种高效的运动规划方法，适用于物理耦合多机器人系统，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Motion planning problems for physically-coupled multi-robot systems in
cluttered environments are challenging due to their high dimensionality.
Existing methods combining sampling-based planners with trajectory optimization
produce suboptimal results and lack theoretical guarantees. We propose
Physically-coupled discontinuity-bounded Conflict-Based Search (pc-dbCBS), an
anytime kinodynamic motion planner, that extends discontinuity-bounded CBS to
rigidly-coupled systems. Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection
and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the
robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space
representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic
optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25
simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a
cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods,
pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and
plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an
order of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个明确的、共同的基准来评估VLMs在机器人低层推理（如精确运动决策）中的能力。

Method: 设计了ManipBench基准，测试VLMs在物体-物体交互和可变形物体操作等维度的表现，并对33个代表性VLMs进行了广泛测试。

Result: VLMs在不同任务中表现差异显著，且其性能与真实世界操作任务趋势强相关，但仍与人类理解水平存在显著差距。

Conclusion: ManipBench为评估VLMs在机器人低层推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and
robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic
manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work
has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making
decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks
a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level
reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench,
to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs
across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object
interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33
representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including
variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the
performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong
correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation
tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models
and human-level understanding. See our website at:

Conclusion: FlowDreamer通过显式运动表示和模块化设计，显著提升了视觉世界模型的性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates training better visual world models for robot
manipulation, i.e., models that can predict future visual observations by
conditioning on past frames and robot actions. Specifically, we consider world
models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to
canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and
reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer,
which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer
first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a
U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the
scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature.
We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video
prediction and visual planning tasks. The results demonstrate that FlowDreamer
achieves better performance compared to other baseline RGB-D world models by 7%
on semantic similarity, 11% on pixel quality, and 6% on success rate in various
robot manipulation domains.

Motivation: 在工业环境中，多机器人执行同质任务时，任务分配和碰撞避免是两个关键但看似独立的问题。本文旨在通过空间聚类统一解决这两个问题。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将工作空间划分为可区分的操作区域，并结合2-Opt算法分配任务和规划机器人路径。

Result: 框架表现优异，时间减少93%（1.24秒对17.62秒），解决方案质量提升7%，并完全消除了碰撞点。

Conclusion: 空间分区在任务分配和碰撞避免中具有显著优势，适用于计算效率和零碰撞操作至关重要的实际应用。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel framework is presented that achieves a combined
solution based on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and collision avoidance
with respect to homogeneous measurement tasks taking place in industrial
environments. The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve
the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the
workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task
sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use
K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows
satisfactory performance, where up to 93\% time reduction (1.24s against
17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\% compared to the best
performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates
collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant
sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning
unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance
problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse
geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial
importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and
operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.

Abstract: We present EmbodiedMAE, a unified 3D multi-modal representation for robot

training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model
architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome
these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps
and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D
embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked
autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and
point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion.
Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final
performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation
tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with
size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental
results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for
embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings
where spatial perception is critical.

Result: 初步结果表明，通过推动障碍物而非避障，可优化多代理的长期路径效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为需要长期高效导航的环境（如月球或火星表面）提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the
predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path
planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an
indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the
obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that
will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and
lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we
propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured
environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic
manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates
exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of
obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our
preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both
the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation
module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle
via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our
navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple
agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in
environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as
lunar or Martian surfaces.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for
Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), their robustness in real-world conditions,
particularly under external disturbances, remains insufficiently explored. In
this paper, we evaluate the resilience of a DRL-based agent designed to capture
floating waste under various perturbations. We train the agent using domain
randomization and evaluate its performance in real-world field tests, assessing
its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an
off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations
in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance
degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline. Results indicate that
the DRL agent performs reliably despite significant disturbances. Along with
the open-source release of our implementation, we provide insights into
effective training strategies, real-world challenges, and practical
considerations for deploying DRLbased ASV controllers.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct

suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning
phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning
and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL
updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of
IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout
the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization
objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive
interference during \ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting
gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes
learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot
manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including
FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \ABBR can
significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse
during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either
sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g.,
from 12\% to 88\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic
Transport. Project page: https://github.com/ucd-dare/IN-RIL.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种知识捕获、适应与组合（KCAC）框架，通过跨任务课程学习将知识转移系统化地融入强化学习，显著提升了训练效率和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作中潜力巨大，但样本效率低和缺乏可解释性限制了其实际应用。通过知识转移提升代理的理解和适应能力是关键。

Method: 提出KCAC框架，采用跨任务课程学习，重新设计奖励函数并定义子任务，优化课程设计参数。

Result: KCAC在训练时间减少40%的同时，任务成功率提高10%。

Conclusion: KCAC为基于课程的强化学习框架提供了概念指导，对机器人学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic
manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of
interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling
the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse
working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key
factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation,
and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer
into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two
block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic
manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to
solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In
this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid
constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards
concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two
self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to
facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40
percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10
percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we
identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing,
and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual
guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights
into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FORTRESS框架通过多模态推理和实时规划，生成安全的备用策略以防止OOD故障，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义的干预策略，无法实现通用的语义安全运动规划。

Method: FORTRESS结合多模态推理和动态感知规划，实时生成备用目标并避免不安全区域。

Result: 在合成基准和真实机器人数据上，FORTRESS在安全分类准确性和系统安全性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FORTRESS通过开放世界推理和动态规划，显著提升了系统安全性和规划成功率。

Abstract: Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate
safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data,
i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference
latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually
defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability
to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges
we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically
safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low
frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to
identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a
fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while
inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging
open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate
the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS
outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety
classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot
data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and
on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.

TL;DR: AutoCam是一种自动辅助摄像头放置方法，用于机器人辅助微创手术（RAMIS），通过结合启发式几何放置和非线性优化，提升手术视野和跟踪效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辅助摄像头路径规划方法未能同时考虑摄像头方向、工作空间约束和机器人关节限制，影响了手术中的空间感知。

Method: 采用基于优先级、工作空间约束的控制算法，结合启发式几何放置和非线性优化，实现稳健的摄像头跟踪。

Result: 系统在用户研究中实现了99.84%的显著特征可见性，姿态误差为4.36±2.11度和1.95±5.66毫米，计算效率高（循环时间6.8±12.8毫秒）。

Conclusion: AutoCam证明辅助摄像头可通过达芬奇患者侧机械臂自主控制，为RAMIS中的多摄像头可视化方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.

Method: 提出了方法论标准，支持自动驾驶系统发布的准备审查过程，并讨论了治理和决策流程。

Result: 标准适用于任何技术解决方案，但需配合适当的安全管理实践及其他文化和操作考虑。

Conclusion: 文章指出了其内容的局限性，提醒希望复制其内容的读者需注意实践中的复杂性。

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of how the determination of absence of
unreasonable risk can be operationalized. It complements previous theoretical
work published by existing developers of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) on the
overall engineering practices and methodologies for readiness determination.
Readiness determination is, at its core, a risk assessment process. It is aimed
at evaluating the residual risk associated with the deployment of a new
software release candidate. The paper proposes methodological criteria to
ground the readiness review process for an ADS release. While informed by
Waymo's experience in this domain, the criteria presented are agnostic of any
specific ADS technological solution and/or architectural choice, to support
broad implementation by others in the industry. The paper continues with a
discussion on governance and decision-making toward approval of a new software
release candidate for the ADS. The implementation of the presented criteria
requires the existence of appropriate safety management practices in addition
to many other cultural, procedural, and operational considerations. As such,
the paper is concluded by a statement of limitations for those wishing to
replicate part or all of its content.

Abstract: The research examines the challenges revolving around young people's social
movements, activism regarding sustainability, as well as the accompanying
social media aspect, and how social media impacts environmental action. This
study focuses on the environmental craze on social media platforms and its
impact on young activists aged 16-25. With the advancement of social media, new
avenues have opened for participation in sustainability issues, especially for
the marginalized, as information moved through transnational networks at
lightning speed. Along with specific Formative Visual Storytelling methods, the
young leaders of the movement deploy hashtags and other online tools to capture
the attention of their peers and decision makers. Challenges persist with
"clicktivism" fatigue from the internet, and site limitations. This article
contributes to insights on emerging forms of civic activism by explaining how
digital natives adapt technology to reframe green activism. The research
suggests that effective digital environmental movements integrate online and
offline action, make it simple for individuals to get involved, and promote
tolerance to algorithmic modifications and climate care among participants.

Motivation: 程序员常忽视单元测试的设计与实现，研究旨在探索LLMs在自动生成测试用例中的潜力。

Method: 开发了一种优化的提示方法，整合代码和需求，覆盖关键测试场景（如等价类和边界值），并通过定量指标和手动定性分析比较LLMs与人工测试的效果。

Result: LLMs的效果依赖于提示设计、实现质量和需求精确性，虽然灵活且有潜力，但仍需人工监督。

Conclusion: 手动定性分析是单元测试评估中自动化的重要补充，LLMs需结合人工监督使用。

Abstract: The design and implementation of unit tests is a complex task many
programmers neglect. This research evaluates the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with
manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and
requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and
boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained
programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative
analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on
well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements.
Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This
work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential
complement to automation in unit test evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统漏洞检测方法存在高误报率、扩展性差和依赖人工的问题，促使研究转向基于AI的自动化方法。

Method: 研究使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析GPT-2 Small和Gemma 2B的内部表示，评估其在无需微调LLMs的情况下检测漏洞的能力。

Result: SAE提取的特征在漏洞检测中F1分数高达89%，优于微调的Transformer编码器基线。

Conclusion: SAEs可直接从预训练LLMs的内部表示中检测软件漏洞，无需微调或任务特定监督，首次提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a
major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability
detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates,
scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have
driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and
secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new
avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges
for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising
solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight,
interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the
effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and
Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without
fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug
detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned
transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence
that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal
representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific
supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在编程任务中的推理能力和鲁棒性，避免因逻辑错误导致不可靠的使用。

Method: 应用五种语义保留的代码变异（如变量重命名、分支交换等），测试六种LLM的推理能力，并结合专家分析和基准测试。

Result: 部分LLM（如Llama3.2）在61%的情况下基于错误逻辑得出正确预测，且对代码变异敏感。

Conclusion: LLM在代码理解中的推理和鲁棒性仍需改进，需进一步研究其可靠性。

Abstract: Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have
assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the
accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them.
Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can
arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar
issues in code understanding.
  In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B
parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply
five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring
comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to
while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while
altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert
analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are
based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across
different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that
some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed
reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in
response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic
understanding.

Conclusion: 该工作为设计可生成经典神经网络参数的QNN提供了一种可扩展且自动化的途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML)
have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates
the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum
circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown
promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is
hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware
imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges.
To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential
scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters,
enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter
compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such
quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires
expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an
automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly
optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in
an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed
framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning
tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually
designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway
for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across
diverse applications.

Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for
temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature
maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance
in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum
reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical
computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory
retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order
unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we
show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with
increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir
iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with
quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates
generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast,
the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both
reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove
exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving
these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding
concentration in temporal quantum learning models.

Result: 在50万条真实用户数据上验证，框架能有效估计家庭用户数量及其特征变化。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为家庭多用户行为建模和个性化推荐提供了有效工具。

Abstract: TV customers today face many choices from many live channels and on-demand
services. Providing a personalised experience that saves customers time when
discovering content is essential for TV providers. However, a reliable
understanding of their behaviour and preferences is key. When creating
personalised recommendations for TV, the biggest challenge is understanding
viewing behaviour within households when multiple people are watching. The
objective is to detect and combine individual profiles to make
better-personalised recommendations for group viewing. Our challenge is that we
have little explicit information about who is watching the devices at any time
(individuals or groups). Also, we do not have a way to combine more than one
individual profile to make better recommendations for group viewing. We propose
a novel framework using a Gaussian mixture model averaging to obtain point
estimates for the number of household TV profiles and a Bayesian random walk
model to introduce uncertainty. We applied our approach using data from real
customers whose TV-watching data totalled approximately half a million
observations. Our results indicate that combining our framework with the
selected features provides a means to estimate the number of household TV
profiles and their characteristics, including shifts over time and
quantification of uncertainty.

on-the-fly. Essential to our approach are so-called equivalence registries
which manage information about equivalent states and allow for incorporating
further optimization techniques such as convexity closures or simulation to
boost performance. Due to the generality of our approach, these concepts can be
embedded in classic subset construction or Brzozowski's approach. We evaluate
our approach on a set of real-world examples from automatic sequences and

Motivation: 无线定位对5G/6G应用至关重要，但现有数据驱动方法需要大量标注数据且泛化能力不足。

Result: LWLM在所有定位任务中均优于模型驱动和监督学习方法，性能提升26.0%--87.5%，且在标签有限和未知基站配置下表现优异。

Conclusion: LWLM作为无线定位的基础模型具有潜力，尤其在泛化能力和标签效率方面表现突出。

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G
applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart
manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing
models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across
deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless
localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)
tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on
information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a
pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model
(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three
complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling
(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)
position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly
capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple
perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,
including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,
single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.
Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses
both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization
tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer
models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under
label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its
potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.

Abstract: We investigate the efficient learning of magnetic phases using artificial
neural networks trained on synthetic data, combining computational simplicity
with physics-informed strategies. Focusing on the diluted Ising model, which
lacks an exact analytical solution, we explore two complementary approaches: a
supervised classification using simple dense neural networks, and an
unsupervised detection of phase transitions using convolutional autoencoders
trained solely on idealized spin configurations.
  To enhance model performance, we incorporate two key forms of
physics-informed guidance. First, we exploit architectural biases which
preferentially amplify features related to symmetry breaking. Second, we
include training configurations that explicitly break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry,
reinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms,
acting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in
the absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions
through comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and
percolation thresholds.
  Our results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient
training schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in
complex systems. This framework offers a low-cost and robust alternative to
conventional methods, with potential applications in broader condensed matter
and statistical physics contexts.

Result: 新模型能够重现样本方差，同时在线性框架内保留解释力。

Conclusion: 非线性ERGs在解释复杂网络结构时具有潜力，尤其是在处理方差问题时。

Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks
represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random
Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only
linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural
organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of
accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim,
non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field
approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to
degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model
is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory
power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.

Motivation: 慢性心力衰竭管理需要持续监测和个性化治疗，机器学习模型可帮助早期识别高风险患者，支持医疗决策。

Conclusion: 该模型可作为决策支持工具，助力早期干预和个性化管理，尤其在PrediHealth项目中具有潜力。

Abstract: The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges
in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of
exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present
a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify
patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified
stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and
echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of
these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the
obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of
patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\%),
ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we
obtained 84\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However,
it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF
because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the
PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are
working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification
models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth
project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and
personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value
and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results
with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results
indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly
consider features, \ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic
features.

Conclusion: 该框架可行且为混合物组分重构和过程集成建模提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of pure component physiochemical properties is crucial
for process integration, multiscale modeling, and optimization. In this work,
an enhanced framework for pure component property prediction by using
explainable machine learning methods is proposed. In this framework, the
molecular representation method based on the connectivity matrix effectively
considers atomic bonding relationships to automatically generate features. The
supervised machine learning model random forest is applied for feature ranking
and pooling. The adjusted R2 is introduced to penalize the inclusion of
additional features, providing an assessment of the true contribution of
features. The prediction results for normal boiling point (Tb), liquid molar
volume, critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) obtained using
Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Process Regression models confirm the
accuracy of the molecular representation method. Comparison with GC based
models shows that the root-mean-square error on the test set can be reduced by
up to 83.8%. To enhance the interpretability of the model, a feature analysis
method based on Shapley values is employed to determine the contribution of
each feature to the property predictions. The results indicate that using the
feature pooling method reduces the number of features from 13316 to 100 without
compromising model accuracy. The feature analysis results for Tb, Tc, and Pc
confirms that different molecular properties are influenced by different
structural features, aligning with mechanistic interpretations. In conclusion,
the proposed framework is demonstrated to be feasible and provides a solid
foundation for mixture component reconstruction and process integration
modelling.

Abstract: Quantifying the causal influence of input features within neural networks has
become a topic of increasing interest. Existing approaches typically assess
direct, indirect, and total causal effects. This work treats NNs as structural
causal models (SCMs) and extends our focus to include intrinsic causal
contributions (ICC). We propose an identifiable generative post-hoc framework
for quantifying ICC. We also draw a relationship between ICC and Sobol'
indices. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
ICC generates more intuitive and reliable explanations compared to existing

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating differences in two multi-attribute
Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) which are known to have similar structure,
using a penalized D-trace loss function with non-convex penalties. The GGM
structure is encoded in its precision (inverse covariance) matrix. Existing
methods for multi-attribute differential graph estimation are based on a group
lasso penalized loss function. In this paper, we consider a penalized D-trace
loss function with non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation
(SCAD)) penalties. Two proximal gradient descent methods are presented to
optimize the objective function. Theoretical analysis establishing sufficient
conditions for consistency in support recovery, convexity and estimation in
high-dimensional settings is provided. We illustrate our approaches with
numerical examples based on synthetic and real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和工业应用中，获取大量空间分布数据（如气候模型）成本高昂，传统MLE方法计算复杂，尤其是对非平稳大尺度场。

Method: 利用SAR参数可排列为规则网格的特性，将输入（空间场）和输出（模型参数）视为图像，采用I2I网络进行参数估计。

Result: I2I网络显著提高了非平稳SAR模型参数估计的速度和准确性，适用于前所未有的复杂模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效模拟合成空间场提供了新途径，特别适用于数据获取成本高的场景。

Abstract: In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of
instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field')
but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global
temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers,
and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively
expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers
an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields.
However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is
computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus,
many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial
fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a
popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a
simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on
a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can
be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image
(I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class
of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.

Result: 该方法在大多数情况下与商业求解器的资产选择结果一致，少数情况下差异微小且投资组合方差误差可忽略。

Conclusion: 提出的梯度方法高效且可扩展，适用于稀疏投资组合优化问题。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization involves selecting asset weights to minimize a
risk-reward objective, such as the portfolio variance in the classical
minimum-variance framework. Sparse portfolio selection extends this by imposing
a cardinality constraint: only $k$ assets from a universe of $p$ may be
included. The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer
quadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal
solution. However, the computational costs of such methods increase
exponentially with $k$ and $p$, making them too slow for problems of even
moderate size. We propose a fast and scalable gradient-based approach that
transforms the combinatorial sparse selection problem into a constrained
continuous optimization task via Boolean relaxation, while preserving
equivalence with the original problem on the set of binary points. Our
algorithm employs a tunable parameter that transmutes the auxiliary objective
from a convex to a concave function. This allows a stable convex starting
point, followed by a controlled path toward a sparse binary solution as the
tuning parameter increases and the objective moves toward concavity. In
practice, our method matches commercial solvers in asset selection for most
instances and, in rare instances, the solution differs by a few assets whilst
showing a negligible error in portfolio variance.

Conclusion: 路径梯度在微调过程中保留了流的已学习结构，同时显著提升了采样效率。

Abstract: Boltzmann Generators have emerged as a promising machine learning tool for
generating samples from equilibrium distributions of molecular systems using
Normalizing Flows and importance weighting. Recently, Flow Matching has helped
speed up Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), scale them to more complex
molecular systems, and minimize the length of the flow integration
trajectories. We investigate the benefits of using path gradients to fine-tune
CNFs initially trained by Flow Matching, in the setting where a target energy
is known. Our experiments show that this hybrid approach yields up to a
threefold increase in sampling efficiency for molecular systems, all while
using the same model, a similar computational budget and without the need for
additional sampling. Furthermore, by measuring the length of the flow
trajectories during fine-tuning, we show that path gradients largely preserve
the learned structure of the flow.

Motivation: 现有单阶段学习延迟方法仅支持延迟到单个专家，无法灵活处理多实体延迟需求，限制了效率和成本效益。

Method: 提出一种共享的基于分数的模型，通过端到端目标联合优化预测和延迟，定义成本敏感损失并推导出新的凸代理损失，支持动态调整延迟实体数量。

Result: 实验表明，Top-$k$方法优于Top-1延迟，Top-$k(x)$能根据输入复杂度动态调整延迟实体数量，实现更优的准确性与成本平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架在多实体延迟场景中表现优越，动态调整策略进一步提升了灵活性和效率。

Abstract: We introduce the first one-stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer framework, which
unifies prediction and deferral by learning a shared score-based model that
selects the $k$ most cost-effective entities-labels or experts-per input. While
existing one-stage L2D methods are limited to deferring to a single expert, our
approach jointly optimizes prediction and deferral across multiple entities
through a single end-to-end objective. We define a cost-sensitive loss and
derive a novel convex surrogate that is independent of the cardinality
parameter $k$, enabling generalization across Top-$k$ regimes without
retraining. Our formulation recovers the Top-1 deferral policy of prior
score-based methods as a special case, and we prove that our surrogate is both
Bayes-consistent and $\mathcal{H}$-consistent under mild assumptions. We
further introduce an adaptive variant, Top-$k(x)$, which dynamically selects
the number of consulted entities per input to balance predictive accuracy and
consultation cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN confirm that our one-stage
Top-$k$ method strictly outperforms Top-1 deferral, while Top-$k(x)$ achieves
superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by tailoring allocations to input complexity.

Abstract: Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is challenging when
the likelihood function is irregular and expensive to compute. We explore
several sampling algorithms that make use of subset evaluations to reduce
computational overhead. We adapt the subset samplers for this setting where
gradient information is not available or is unreliable. To achieve this, we
introduce data-driven proxies in place of Taylor expansions and define a novel
computation-cost aware adaptive controller. We undertake an extensive
evaluation for a challenging disease modelling task and a configurable task
with similar irregularity in the likelihood surface. We find our improved
version of Hierarchical Importance with Nested Training Samples (HINTS), with
adaptive proposals and a data-driven proxy, obtains the best sampling error in
a fixed computational budget. We conclude that subset evaluations can provide
cheap and naturally-tempered exploration, while a data-driven proxy can
pre-screen proposals successfully in explored regions of the state space. These
two elements combine through hierarchical delayed acceptance to achieve
efficient, exact sampling.

Result: 在2、10和20维多模态分布实验中，FlowVAT优于传统和自适应退火方法，发现更多模式且ELBO值更高。

Conclusion: FlowVAT无需复杂调参和温度调度，推动了复杂后验分布的黑盒变分推断发展。

Abstract: Multi-modal and high-dimensional posteriors present significant challenges
for variational inference, causing mode-seeking behavior and collapse despite
the theoretical expressiveness of normalizing flows. Traditional annealing
methods require temperature schedules and hyperparameter tuning, falling short
of the goal of truly black-box variational inference. We introduce FlowVAT, a
conditional tempering approach for normalizing flow variational inference that
addresses these limitations. Our method tempers both the base and target
distributions simultaneously, maintaining affine-invariance under tempering. By
conditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized
neural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow
representing the posterior across a range of temperatures. This preserves modes
identified at higher temperatures when sampling from the variational posterior
at $T = 1$, mitigating standard variational methods' mode-seeking behavior. In
experiments with 2, 10, and 20 dimensional multi-modal distributions, FlowVAT
outperforms traditional and adaptive annealing methods, finding more modes and
achieving better ELBO values, particularly in higher dimensions where existing
approaches fail. Our method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and does not
require an annealing schedule, advancing toward fully-automatic black-box
variational inference for complicated posteriors.

Conclusion: BaNk-UCB是一种高效的非参数化算法，适用于有限批次的上下文多臂老虎机问题，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making in batched nonparametric contextual
bandits, where actions are selected over a finite horizon divided into a small
number of batches. Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and
marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric
algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the
upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully
nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement.
Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB
uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and
exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard
Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated
batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal
rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.

Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) has emerged as a promising treatment
for Parkinson disease (PD). In aDBS, a surgically placed electrode sends
dynamically altered stimuli to the brain based on neurophysiological feedback:
an invasive gadget that limits the amount of data one could collect for
optimizing the control offline. As a consequence, a plethora of synthetic
models of PD and those of the control algorithms have been proposed. Herein, we
introduce the first neurophysiologically realistic benchmark for comparing said
models. Specifically, our methodology covers not only conventional basal
ganglia circuit dynamics and pathological oscillations, but also captures 15
previously dismissed physiological attributes, such as signal instabilities and
noise, neural drift, electrode conductance changes and individual variability -
all modeled as spatially distributed and temporally registered features via
beta-band activity in the brain and a feedback. Furthermore, we purposely built
our framework as a structured environment for training and evaluating deep
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, opening new possibilities for
optimizing aDBS control strategies and inviting the machine learning community
to contribute to the emerging field of intelligent neurostimulation interfaces.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical model to explain how the human mind
and artificial intelligence can approach real-time awareness by reducing
perceptual delays. By investigating cosmic signal delay, neurological reaction
times, and the ancient cognitive state of stillness, we explore how one may
shift from reactive perception to a conscious interface with the near future.
This paper introduces both a physical and cognitive model for perceiving the
present not as a linear timestamp, but as an interference zone where
early-arriving cosmic signals and reactive human delays intersect. We propose
experimental approaches to test these ideas using human neural observation and
neuro-receptive extensions. Finally, we propose a mathematical framework to
guide the evolution of AI systems toward temporally efficient, ethically sound,
and internally conscious decision-making processes

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disease with millions of patients
worldwide. Many patients have turned to alternative medicine due to the limited
efficacy and side effects of conventional antiepileptic drugs. In this study,
we developed a computational approach to optimize herbal epilepsy treatment
through AI-driven analysis of global natural products and statistically
validated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our intelligent prescription
system combines machine learning (ML) algorithms for herb-efficacy
characterization, Bayesian optimization for personalized dosing, and
meta-analysis of RCTs for evidence-based recommendations. The system analyzed
1,872 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and
ethnopharmacological databases, integrating their bioactive properties with
clinical outcomes from 48 RCTs covering 48 epilepsy conditions (n=5,216). Using
LASSO regression and SHAP value analysis, we identified 17 high-efficacy herbs
(e.g., Gastrodia elata [using \'e for accented characters], Withania
somnifera), showing significant seizure reduction (p$<$0.01, Cohen's d=0.89)
with statistical significance confirmed by multiple testing (p$<$0.001). A
randomized double-blind validation trial (n=120) demonstrated 28.5\% greater
seizure frequency reduction with AI-optimized herbal prescriptions compared to
conventional protocols (95\% CI: 18.7-37.3\%, p=0.003).

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VRSplat结合并扩展了3DGS技术，解决了VR中的时间伪影、投影失真和帧率问题，通过改进的栅格化器和优化步骤，实现了72+ FPS且无伪影的VR体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在VR中面临时间伪影、投影失真和帧率不足的问题，这些问题在VR环境中尤为突出，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 结合Mini-Splatting、StopThePop和Optimal Projection技术，改进3DGS栅格化器，提出高效的中心凹栅格化器，并优化高斯参数。

Result: 通过用户研究验证，VRSplat优于其他配置，实现了72+ FPS且消除了伪影和浮动物体。

Conclusion: VRSplat是首个系统评估的3DGS方法，能够支持现代VR应用，提供高质量和流畅的体验。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for
novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient
software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time
applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS
faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as
popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in
disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when
rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for
VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by
large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of
head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine
and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR
holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal
Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques
and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated
rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch,
avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also
incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on
StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method
through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong
preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is
the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern
VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and
stereo-disrupting floaters.

*Peiying Zhang,Nanxuan Zhao,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段的SVG风格定制生成方法，结合了前馈T2V模型和T2I先验，解决了现有方法在风格定制和结构一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到矢量图（T2V）生成方法忽略了风格定制的需求，而风格定制在实际应用中至关重要。优化型和前馈型T2V模型各有不足，无法同时满足结构一致性和风格解耦的需求。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）训练路径级表示的T2V扩散模型以保持结构一致性；2）通过蒸馏定制T2I模型实现风格定制。

Result: 实验验证了该方法能高效生成高质量、多样化的定制风格SVG。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了两种模型的优势，解决了风格定制和结构一致性的问题，为实际应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their
resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing
text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they
often overlook an important need in practical applications: style
customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics
with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing
T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.
Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I)
models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.
On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity,
yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to
limited SVG training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization
pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward
T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion
model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of
SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we
customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized
T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate
high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an
efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been
validated through extensive experiments. The project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核反应堆中子通量的空间分布重建是一个复杂问题，传统解析方法难以适用于异质复杂几何结构，因此需要一种数据驱动的数值方法。

Method: 通过基尔霍夫-亥姆霍兹方程将问题转化为逆问题，推导满足对称性的格林函数，并结合中子扩散模型和传感器数据实现通量重建算法。

Result: 证明了从采样数据推断的格林函数的存在性和唯一性，验证了方法的可靠性和预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂几何结构下的中子通量重建提供了一种可靠且实用的数值解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution
of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements
obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation
inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain
based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this
task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the
domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for
Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex,
heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach.
The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the
data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H
equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that
the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the
one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive
description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing
the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and
uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are
demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its
predictions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种风险感知的安全强化学习（RL）控制设计，通过结合RL控制器和安全控制器，实现高置信度安全性和高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全认证器干预RL控制器，可能导致短视行为和不良平衡。本文旨在通过联合学习RL和安全控制器，避免这些问题。

Method: 采用分段仿射控制器替代线性控制器，通过数据驱动方法设计决策变量以最小化安全违规概率，并引入插值技术整合RL和安全控制器。

Result: 该方法减少了数据需求和安全违规的方差，同时保持了RL的优化性能。仿真验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 提出的风险感知RL控制设计在保证安全性的同时提高了效率和适应性，适用于噪声环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control
design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety
certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe
controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe
controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this
approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a
high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic
interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by
deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly
efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing
over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To
learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers
are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system
is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The
effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the
closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such
that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is
minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data
requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to
integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation
technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal
implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by
noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate
the theoretical results.

Result: 在非独立同分布数据下，该方法优于其他攻击算法，能获取全局目标模型。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且成本低，适用于联邦学习的投毒攻击场景。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks by malicious
adversaries. Existing methods often involve high costs to achieve effective
attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a sybil-based virtual data
poisoning attack, where a malicious client generates sybil nodes to amplify the
poisoning model's impact. To reduce neural network computational complexity, we
develop a virtual data generation method based on gradient matching. We also
design three schemes for target model acquisition, applicable to online local,
online global, and offline scenarios. In simulation, our method outperforms
other attack algorithms since our method can obtain a global target model under
non-independent uniformly distributed data.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索LLMs在网络安全应用中的潜力与风险，尤其是微调后模型安全性的下降问题。

Method: 使用OWASP Top 10框架评估了七种开源LLMs，并提出了一种通过重写指令-响应对的安全对齐方法。

Result: 结果显示微调普遍降低模型安全性（如Llama 3.1 8B的安全评分从0.95降至0.15），但安全对齐方法能有效提升安全性。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更安全的微调方法提供了实践路径，推动了生成式AI在敏感领域的可信应用。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security
applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat
analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and
safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of
new malware. We present a systematic evaluation of safety risks in fine-tuned
LLMs for cyber security applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 for LLM
Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B,
Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B.
Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all
tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection
drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach
that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety
precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is
possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical
utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning
methodologies. This work offers a systematic evaluation for safety risks in
LLMs, enabling safer adoption of generative AI in sensitive domains, and
contributing towards the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically
aligned LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆编队系统易受内部攻击，可能导致灾难性碰撞，因此需要有效的异常检测方法。

Method: 使用多头Transformer编码器处理运动数据，区分正常行为与攻击。

Result: 在多种攻击和操作场景下，F1分数达0.95，延迟低至100ms。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器是保护C-ITS免受内部威胁的有效方法。

Abstract: Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated
through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits
in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to
sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can
destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This
paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning
systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for
misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify
anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head
transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling
effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification
attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state
(no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an
extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant,
gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller
types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results
demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack
detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers.
Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision
intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety
applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and
establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider
threats.

Method: 开发了基于GPT-4o和LangChain的AutoPentest工具，支持多步骤任务和外部工具集成，并在Hack The Box机器上进行了实验。

Result: AutoPentest和ChatGPT-4o均能完成15-25%的子任务，AutoPentest略优，总成本为96.20美元。

Conclusion: 未来通过更强大的LLMs和进一步开发，自动化渗透测试有望成为漏洞管理的可行方案。

Abstract: A recent area of increasing research is the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in penetration testing, which promises to reduce costs and thus allow
for higher frequency. We conduct a review of related work, identifying best
practices and common evaluation issues. We then present AutoPentest, an
application for performing black-box penetration tests with a high degree of
autonomy. AutoPentest is based on the LLM GPT-4o from OpenAI and the LLM agent
framework LangChain. It can perform complex multi-step tasks, augmented by
external tools and knowledge bases. We conduct a study on three
capture-the-flag style Hack The Box (HTB) machines, comparing our
implementation AutoPentest with the baseline approach of manually using the
ChatGPT-4o user interface. Both approaches are able to complete 15-25 % of the
subtasks on the HTB machines, with AutoPentest slightly outperforming ChatGPT.
We measure a total cost of \$96.20 US when using AutoPentest across all
experiments, while a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus costs \$20. The
results show that further implementation efforts and the use of more powerful
LLMs released in the future are likely to make this a viable part of

Motivation: 企业网络攻击面扩大导致安全警报数量激增，SOC分析师面临警报疲劳问题，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: AACT系统通过分析SOC警报分类行为，实时预测分类决策，自动关闭良性警报并优先处理关键警报。

Result: 在真实SOC环境中，AACT系统减少了61%的警报展示，误报率仅为1.36%。

Conclusion: AACT系统有效缓解了SOC分析师的警报疲劳问题，提升了工作效率和准确性。

Abstract: Enterprise networks are growing ever larger with a rapidly expanding attack
surface, increasing the volume of security alerts generated from security
controls. Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to
identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the
overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC
providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited
visibility into business processes.
  A novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by
learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately
predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed
automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue
allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats.
The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open
dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign
alerts.
  Additionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC
environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a
low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.

Motivation: 生成式人工智能（GenAI）的快速发展为制图过程提供了新机会，但以往研究要么忽视地图的艺术性，要么难以同时保证准确性和信息量。

Method: CartoAgent利用MLLMs的视觉审美能力和世界知识，通过分离样式与地理数据，专注于设计样式表而不修改矢量数据，确保地理准确性。

Result: 实验和人类评估验证了CartoAgent在地图样式迁移和评估任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: CartoAgent可扩展支持多种制图设计决策，并为GenAI在制图领域的未来集成提供参考。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents
new opportunities to advance the cartographic process. Previous studies have
either overlooked the artistic aspects of maps or faced challenges in creating
both accurate and informative maps. In this study, we propose CartoAgent, a
novel multi-agent cartographic framework powered by multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). This framework simulates three key stages in cartographic
practice: preparation, map design, and evaluation. At each stage, different
MLLMs act as agents with distinct roles to collaborate, discuss, and utilize
tools for specific purposes. In particular, CartoAgent leverages MLLMs' visual
aesthetic capability and world knowledge to generate maps that are both
visually appealing and informative. By separating style from geographic data,
it can focus on designing stylesheets without modifying the vector-based data,
thereby ensuring geographic accuracy. We applied CartoAgent to a specific task
centered on map restyling-namely, map style transfer and evaluation. The
effectiveness of this framework was validated through extensive experiments and
a human evaluation study. CartoAgent can be extended to support a variety of
cartographic design decisions and inform future integrations of GenAI in
cartography.

Result: 研究结果为未来DeAgents系统和协议设计提供指导，并推动AI系统治理的讨论。

Conclusion: DeAgents在去中心化与自主性之间存在矛盾，需进一步研究以平衡信任与可靠性。

Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents)
combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization
technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution
environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents
to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and
control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates
centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust
concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges
in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension
between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this
empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts,
founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance
dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design
and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于LLM的聊天机器人如何提升投票建议应用（VAA）的互动性和透明度，通过混合方法研究发现聊天机器人能有效促进选民反思和理性决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAA的复杂语言和固定形式限制了其对非专业选民的实用性，而聊天机器人的个性化互动潜力尚未被充分挖掘。

Method: 在德国2024年欧洲议会选举前，向331名用户部署VAA聊天机器人，结合调查、对话日志和10次后续访谈进行分析。

Result: 参与者认为聊天机器人直观且信息丰富，其简单语言和灵活互动促进了反思和理性决策。

Conclusion: 研究提出了设计互动且可信赖的VAA聊天机器人的建议，强调透明度和用户需求的重要性。

Abstract: Voting advice applications (VAAs), which have become increasingly prominent
in European elections, are seen as a successful tool for boosting electorates'
political knowledge and engagement. However, VAAs' complex language and rigid
presentation constrain their utility to less-sophisticated voters. While
previous work enhanced VAAs' click-based interaction with scripted
explanations, a conversational chatbot's potential for tailored discussion and
deliberate political decision-making remains untapped. Our exploratory
mixed-method study investigates how LLM-based chatbots can support voting
preparation. We deployed a VAA chatbot to 331 users before Germany's 2024
European Parliament election, gathering insights from surveys, conversation
logs, and 10 follow-up interviews. Participants found the VAA chatbot intuitive
and informative, citing its simple language and flexible interaction. We
further uncovered VAA chatbots' role as a catalyst for reflection and
rationalization. Expanding on participants' desire for transparency, we provide
design recommendations for building interactive and trustworthy VAA chatbots.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将修辞设计融入可解释人工智能（XAI）系统的潜在好处，强调解释作为论证形式如何影响用户对系统的评价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAI关注解释预测或系统行为，但解释也是一种论证形式，影响用户对系统的有用性、可信度和信任。修辞设计为分析解释的沟通作用提供了框架。

Method: 通过修辞设计框架分析解释的三个方面：逻辑推理、系统可信度和情感共鸣，并综合现有XAI设计策略。

Result: 修辞设计有助于理解解释如何影响用户感知并促进AI采用，同时揭示了整合修辞设计的机遇与挑战。

Conclusion: 修辞设计为XAI提供了新的视角，但其整合仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: This paper explores potential benefits of incorporating Rhetorical Design
into the design of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. While XAI
is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall
system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping
how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster
appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the
communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on:
(1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2)
credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional
resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us
understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI
adoption. This paper synthesizes design strategies from prior XAI work that
align with these three rhetorical appeals and highlights both opportunities and
challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Reviewer的3D视觉界面，通过实时投影EMG信号到解码器的分类空间，显著提高了肌电假肢的模式识别控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着假肢运动复杂度的增加，用户难以生成足够独特的EMG信号以供可靠分类，现有训练方法依赖试错调整。

Method: 通过10次实验研究，比较了使用Reviewer与传统虚拟手臂可视化训练后的PR性能，评估了任务完成率、路径效率等指标。

Result: 使用Reviewer的参与者表现出更高的任务完成率、更少的过冲和更好的路径效率。

Conclusion: 3D视觉反馈通过结构化训练显著改善了新手操作者的PR控制，减少了试错调整的需求。

Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern
recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals
into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users
often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable
classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error
user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,
a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's
classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm
behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual,
data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder
boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants
compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the
Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was
assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and
the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer
achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path
efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group.
Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training,
facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control
improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this
approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more
adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual
feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through
structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance
on extensive heuristic adjustments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过深度学习方法（注意力自编码器和条件生成对抗网络）生成高质量HAR数据集的方法，并通过随机序列策略显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HAR领域高质量和多样化数据获取困难的问题，以及数据异质性对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用注意力自编码器和条件生成对抗网络生成数据集，并通过随机序列策略打乱数据分布。

Result: 随机序列策略显著提升了分类性能，准确率达到0.70 ± 0.03，宏F1分数为0.64 ± 0.01。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅扩展了有效训练数据集，还为复杂现实场景中的HAR系统提供了改进方向。

Abstract: In the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), obtaining high quality and
variance data is still a persistent challenge due to high costs and the
inherent variability of real-world activities. This study introduces a
generation dataset by deep learning approaches (Attention Autoencoder and
conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). Another problem that data
heterogeneity is a critical challenge, one of the solutions is to shuffle the
data to homogenize the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the
random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance,
achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64
$\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence
reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby
improving robustness against activity transitions. This approach not only
broadens the effective training dataset but also offers promising avenues for
enhancing HAR systems in complex, real-world scenarios.

Result: AI LEGO显著增加了危害识别的数量和可能性，其模块化结构和角色模拟使伦理评估更易进行。

Conclusion: AI LEGO通过支持知识传递和协作，改善了早期AI设计中的伦理实践。

Abstract: Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of
addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through
social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work
is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of
transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical
experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm
identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8
practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design
choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by
non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to
support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without
scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google
Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint
harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to
align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based
prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively
facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the
early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft
development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through
stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface
potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO
increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline
worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts
made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more
collaborative RAI practices in early design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图表检索系统因缺乏全面的语义洞察而表现不佳，无法充分理解图表的语义和上下文信息。

Method: 开发了一个训练数据生成管道，自动合成图表的层次化语义洞察（视觉、统计、任务导向），并基于此训练ChartFinder模型。

Result: 在CRBench基准测试中，ChartFinder在精确查询中NDCG@10达到66.9%（提升11.58%），模糊查询中平均提升5%。

Conclusion: ChartFinder通过结合视觉和语义信息，显著提升了文本到图表检索的性能，适用于商业智能场景。

Abstract: Charts are crucial for data analysis and decision-making.Text-to-chart
retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence
(BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical
needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are
well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require
understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing
text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content
and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of
comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we
propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes
hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns
(visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical
applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for
69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to
learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method
leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model
that understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate
text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench,
for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI
applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd
workers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing
methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise
queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than
state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates
consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all
metrics.

<details>

Motivation: 验证LLMs是否记忆了公开推荐数据集，因为记忆会降低研究结果的泛化性并加剧偏见。

Method: 通过定义数据集记忆的标准，分析记忆对推荐性能的影响，并比较不同模型家族和大小的记忆差异。

Result: 所有模型均表现出对MovieLens-1M的记忆，且推荐性能与记忆程度相关。

Conclusion: LLMs确实记忆了公开推荐数据集，记忆程度影响推荐性能，需在研究中注意这一问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to
recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding
and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use
of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to
verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of
their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the
generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets
does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization
can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more
frequently than others.
  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public
recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and
Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset
in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as
the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions
can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of
memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether
memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal
that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that
recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have
made all the code publicly available at:

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a well-known example of monotonic
reasoning, of intense practical interest due to fast solvers, complemented by
rigorous fine-grained complexity results. However, for non-monotonic reasoning,
e.g., abductive reasoning, comparably little is known outside classic
complexity theory. In this paper we take a first step of bridging the gap
between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning by analyzing the complexity of
intractable abduction problems under the seemingly overlooked but natural
parameter n: the number of variables in the knowledge base. We obtain several
positive results for $\Sigma^P_2$- as well as NP- and coNP-complete fragments,
which implies the first example of beating exhaustive search for a
$\Sigma^P_2$-complete problem (to the best of our knowledge). We complement
this with lower bounds and for many fragments rule out improvements under the
(strong) exponential-time hypothesis.

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效的超参数优化和元学习器调整，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: This case study applies a phased hyperparameter optimization process to
compare multitask natural language model variants that utilize multiphase
learning rate scheduling and optimizer parameter grouping. We employ short,
Bayesian optimization sessions that leverage multi-fidelity, hyperparameter
space pruning, progressive halving, and a degree of human guidance. We utilize
the Optuna TPE sampler and Hyperband pruner, as well as the Scikit-Learn
Gaussian process minimization. Initially, we use efficient low-fidelity sprints
to prune the hyperparameter space. Subsequent sprints progressively increase
their model fidelity and employ hyperband pruning for efficiency. A second
aspect of our approach is using a meta-learner to tune threshold values to
resolve classification probabilities during inference. We demonstrate our
method on a collection of variants of the 2021 Joint Entity and Relation
Extraction model proposed by Eberts and Ulges.

Result: 在14个未见数据集上验证，优化的系统提示能有效适应多样化用户提示，并快速适应新任务。

Conclusion: 双层系统提示优化方法显著提升了LLM的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with
optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their
performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic
system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt
optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or
tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized,
applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce
the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to
design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable
to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning
framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various
user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user
prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct
experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we
show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to
diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system
prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer
optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved
performance.

Abstract: Analyzing texts such as open-ended responses, headlines, or social media

are promising tools for text analysis, using either a predefined (top-down) or
a data-driven (bottom-up) taxonomy, without sacrificing quality. Here we
present a step-by-step tutorial to efficiently develop, test, and apply
taxonomies for analyzing unstructured data through an iterative and
collaborative process between researchers and LLMs. Using personal goals
provided by participants as an example, we demonstrate how to write prompts to
review datasets and generate a taxonomy of life domains, evaluate and refine
the taxonomy through prompt and direct modifications, test the taxonomy and
assess intercoder agreements, and apply the taxonomy to categorize an entire

<details>

Motivation: 固定tokenization方案在多语言或专业应用中导致效率低下和性能受限，现有方法计算成本高且难以保留语义。

Method: 引入TokenAdapt（混合启发式初始化新token嵌入）和Supertokens预分词学习，结合局部子词分解和全局语义相似性估计。

Result: TokenAdapt显著优于基线方法（如ReTok和TransTokenizer），Supertokens实现压缩增益，零样本困惑度表现更优。

Conclusion: TokenAdapt框架在保留语义的同时减少重训练需求，显著提升性能，适用于多语言和专业场景。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed
tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations,
particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer
lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this
often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer
replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing
methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully
preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression
inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a
model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel
pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and
reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a
hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword
decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the
top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This
methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing
retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions:
the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly
outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including
Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression
gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid
initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both
ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly
trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity
ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement
in these aggregate scores.

Motivation: 手动提取临床报告信息耗时且易错，限制了医疗数据驱动方法的效率。NLP技术可以自动化这一过程，提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用GMV的NLP工具uQuery和基于RoBERTa的bsc-bio-ehr-en3模型，通过NER技术从200份乳腺癌和400份肺癌报告中提取临床实体。

Result: 模型在识别常见实体（如MET和PAT）时表现良好，但对低频实体（如EVOL）仍有挑战。

Conclusion: NLP技术（尤其是NER）在自动化临床信息提取方面具有潜力，但需进一步优化以覆盖低频实体。

Abstract: Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual
extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming
and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in
healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from
electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast
cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on
public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of
cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and
efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels
at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into
standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and
classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information,
including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In
this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity
Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical
information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health
Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast
cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities
manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the
bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained
in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture,
enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our
results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying
entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent
entities like EVOL.

Method: 研究线性探针在LLM隐藏状态中的表现，测试其在短对话和长对话中的泛化能力，并提出通过添加固定关键词短语来改进泛化。

Result: 短对话中真理方向泛化良好，但长对话中表现不佳；添加固定关键词短语显著改善了长对话中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLM谎言检测在新场景中的泛化仍具挑战性，但通过特定方法（如添加关键词短语）可以显著提升其可靠性。

Abstract: Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where
true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the
model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden
state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even
be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how
this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We
find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but
poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the
input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of
generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation.
Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that
generalize to new settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across natural

underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric
knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation
and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning
systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric
knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and
unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent
news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external
information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context
otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework
spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the
Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and
fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting,
models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and
geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g.,
Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against
historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs
for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured
external knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成响应时容易因过拟合而产生错误信息（幻觉），原因是缺乏及时、准确和个性化的输入数据。

Method: 使用知识图谱（KGs）存储和更新结构化数据，结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，为LLMs提供个性化信息支持。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在理解个性化信息和生成准确响应方面显著优于基线LLMs，同时响应时间略有减少。

Conclusion: 知识图谱辅助的RAG方法能有效提升LLMs在个性化任务中的表现，减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications,
including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and
other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs
often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra
and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of
the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and
personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response
generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing
continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can
be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar,
contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our
experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in
understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared
to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate
reduction in response time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多令牌预测在预训练中表现良好，但在微调等场景中效果不稳定，需一种更通用的方法。

Method: MuToR在输入序列中插入可学习的寄存器令牌，每个令牌负责预测未来目标，无需架构改动且参数极少。

Result: MuToR在语言和视觉领域的生成任务中表现优异，适用于监督微调、参数高效微调和预训练。

Conclusion: MuToR是一种简单高效的多令牌预测方法，兼容性强且支持可扩展的预测范围。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction has emerged as a promising objective for improving
language model pretraining, but its benefits have not consistently generalized
to other settings such as fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a
simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves
learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting
future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key
advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters,
requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf
pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining
objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning.
Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases,
including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and
pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision
domains. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/nasosger/MuToR.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields
from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable
capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to
jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems
from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes
unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn
undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their
intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by
dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified
through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal
jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models,
enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon
request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months
ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack.
Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers
were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices
regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and
as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates.
Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to
dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.

Abstract: Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a
persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed
diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and
accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We
evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods
evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and
communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized
quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis
using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that
general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and
affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication
accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential
harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and
trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific
knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need
for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in
mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study
provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering
critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing
future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

Result: 框架提供了比现有方法更全面和可解释的分析，并能预测和引导模型使用更有效的策略。

Conclusion: 训练数据格式对推理行为的影响大于数据领域，强调了格式感知模型设计的重要性。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) is an essential ingredient in effective usage of
modern large language models, but our understanding of the reasoning strategies
underlying these capabilities remains limited. While some prior works have
attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches
are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of
model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up
framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically
extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into
a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives
contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show
that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than
existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables
performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and
guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical
insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs.
multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data
domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)
systems, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential
for diverse applications, including tasks requiring nuanced textual
understanding and contextual reasoning. This study investigates the
capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA3,
Mistral 7B, and Claude-2 - for zero-shot and few-shot annotation of a complex
textual dataset comprising social media posts in Russian and Ukrainian.
Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying
references to human rights violations within the dataset.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared
against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000
samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different
prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian.
Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and
disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths,
limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.
  By juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes
to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive,
domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how
language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a
critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 当前最先进的语言模型通常需要大量参数和计算资源，成本高昂。本文旨在解决语言建模中的上下文嵌入子任务，提出一种资源高效的方法。

Method: 利用GNN中的图卷积操作编码上下文，并与LSTM结合预测下一个词。实验基于自定义的Wikipedia文本语料库，资源消耗较低。

Result: 该方法在资源有限的情况下表现良好，能够有效预测下一个词。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为语言建模提供了一种资源高效的解决方案，尤其适用于计算资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Language Modeling is a prevalent task in Natural Language Processing. The
currently existing most recent and most successful language models often tend
to build a massive model with billions of parameters, feed in a tremendous
amount of text data, and train with enormous computation resources which
require millions of dollars. In this project, we aim to address an important
sub-task in language modeling, i.e., context embedding. We propose an approach
to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and
use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context
of preceding words. We test this on the custom Wikipedia text corpus using a
very limited amount of resources and show that this approach works fairly well
to predict the next word.

Motivation: AI发展的瓶颈在于评估质量，而强大的LLM-as-a-Judge模型是核心解决方案。通过更强的思维链推理提升判断能力，需要找到最佳训练方法。

Method: 采用强化学习训练J1模型，将可验证和不可验证的提示转化为带有可验证奖励的判断任务，激励思考并减少判断偏差。

Result: J1在8B和70B规模下优于其他现有模型，甚至在某些基准测试中超越更大的模型。

Conclusion: J1模型通过学习生成评估标准、自我参考答案和重新评估模型响应的正确性，显著提升了判断能力。

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, and powerful
LLM-as-a-Judge models have proved to be a core solution. Improved judgment
ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need
to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we
introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our
method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks
with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias.
In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models
when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1
also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a
smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs
Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies,
seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our
models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria,
comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the
correctness of model responses.

Motivation: 代码生成中结构重复问题普遍存在且具有挑战性，现有方法主要关注内容重复，忽略了结构重复。

Method: RPG利用语法规则识别重复问题，并通过降低关键令牌的生成概率来缓解重复。

Result: RPG在CodeRepetEval、HumanEval和MBPP基准测试中显著优于基线方法，有效减少重复并提升代码质量。

Conclusion: RPG是一种高效的解码方法，能够显著改善代码生成中的重复问题。

Abstract: With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation
has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the
generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on
content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition
problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is
structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in
various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently
reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition
and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for
Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems
in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to
identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically
decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,
thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we
construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches
for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the
best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and
MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of
generated code.

Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调和强化学习）在训练推理模型时局限于特定领域，而CPT无需任务特定信号，但其在推理数据合成和跨领域影响方面研究不足。

Method: 提出Reasoning CPT，基于文本是作者思维过程的产物这一前提，使用STEM和Law语料库的合成数据训练Gemma2-9B模型，并与标准CPT对比。

Result: Reasoning CPT在所有评估领域均表现更优，推理能力可跨领域迁移，且在难题上提升高达8分；模型还能根据问题难度调整推理深度。

Conclusion: Reasoning CPT是一种有效的跨领域推理训练方法，尤其在复杂问题上表现突出，为LLM的推理能力提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are
primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,
which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of
training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of
not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively
synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of
domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of
Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden
thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the
result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT
to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and
Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis
reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all
evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer
effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as
problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most
challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to
adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于dApps和LibIQ库的实时RF频谱分类方法，解决了O-RAN架构中RIC的延迟和隐私限制问题，实现了高效的信号分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN架构中的RIC存在数据交换延迟和隐私限制，阻碍了实时监控和信号分类等应用。

Method: 利用LibIQ库处理I/Q样本，通过CNN分类信号，并在5G部署和OTA测试平台上验证。

Result: 模型在实时分析中实现了97.8%的平均分类准确率。

Conclusion: LibIQ和数据集将公开，为O-RAN架构中的实时频谱分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN
softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and
control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate
near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps.
However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange
between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to
access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use
cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage
the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a
novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and
signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as
time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and
spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to
detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN
inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an
extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct
signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the
Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by
deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies,
time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model
classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of
approximately 97.8\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We
pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available
framework upon acceptance.

Abstract: AI power demand is growing unprecedentedly thanks to the high power density
of AI compute and the emerging inferencing workload. On the supply side,
abundant wind power is waiting for grid access in interconnection queues. In
this light, this paper argues bringing AI workload to modular compute clusters
co-located in wind farms. Our deployment right-sizing strategy makes it
economically viable to deploy more than 6 million high-end GPUs today that
could consume cheap, green power at its source. We built Heron, a cross-site
software router, that could efficiently leverage the complementarity of power
generation across wind farms by routing AI inferencing workload around power
drops. Using 1-week ofcoding and conversation production traces from Azure and
(real) variable wind power traces, we show how Heron improves aggregate goodput
of AI compute by up to 80% compared to the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: KAITIAN为复杂嵌入式AI应用中的异构计算提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and
intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous
accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing
and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific
proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability
barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types
and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in
distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed
communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified
abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication
libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication
protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a
load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational
tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance
characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously
evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN
demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability
for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can
accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems,
while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining
model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful
heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.

Method: 定义了冲突（不一致性的最小解释）和修复（恢复一致性的方法）的概念，研究了这些概念的属性和容忍不一致性的语义。

Result: 进行了数据复杂性分析，包括生成单个冲突/修复的任务以及基于修复语义的查询蕴含。

Conclusion: 论文为DatalogMTL中的不一致性处理提供了理论基础和复杂性分析。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the issue of inconsistency handling in DatalogMTL,
an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators. Since facts are
associated with time intervals, there are different manners to restore
consistency when they contradict the rules, such as removing facts or modifying
their time intervals. Our first contribution is the definition of relevant
notions of conflicts (minimal explanations for inconsistency) and repairs
(possible ways of restoring consistency) for this setting and the study of the
properties of these notions and the associated inconsistency-tolerant
semantics. Our second contribution is a data complexity analysis of the tasks
of generating a single conflict / repair and query entailment under
repair-based semantics.
