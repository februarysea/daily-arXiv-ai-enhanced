### [1] [Turning to Online Forums for Legal Information: A Case Study of GDPR's Legitimate Interests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04260)
*Lin Kyi,Cristiana Santos,Sushil Ammanaghatta Shivakumar,Franziska Roesner,Asia Biega*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了从业者如何利用在线论坛获取GDPR合规信息，发现论坛信息的准确性对隐私保护至关重要，但从业者在应用“合法利益”法律依据时存在困惑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线论坛为从业者提供法律指导，但其信息的准确性和完整性直接影响GDPR合规决策，需深入研究从业者的决策过程和法律理解。

Method: 以GDPR的“合法利益”法律依据为案例，分析从业者在论坛中的使用情况，评估论坛回答的法律准确性。

Result: 研究发现从业者在应用“合法利益”时存在复杂性，论坛回答通常法律上正确但不完整。

Conclusion: 建议提升论坛回答的法律准确性和全面性，以帮助从业者更好地实践GDPR合规。

Abstract: Practitioners building online services and tools often turn to online forums
such as Reddit, Law Stack Exchange, and Stack Overflow for legal guidance to
ensure compliance with the GDPR. The legal information presented in these
forums directly impact present-day industry practitioner's decisions. Online
forums can serve as gateways that, depending on the accuracy and quality of the
answers provided, may either support or undermine the protection of privacy and
data protection fundamental rights. However, there is a need for deeper
investigation into practitioners' decision-making processes and their
understanding of legal compliance.
  Using GDPR's ``legitimate interests'' legal ground for processing personal
data as a case study, we investigate how practitioners use online forums to
identify common areas of confusion in applying legitimate interests in
practice, and evaluate how legally sound online forum responses are. Our
analysis found that applying the ``legitimate interests'' legal basis is
complex for practitioners, with important implications for how the GDPR is
implemented in practice. The legal analysis showed that crowdsourced legal
information tends to be legally sound, though sometimes incomplete. We outline
recommendations to improve the quality of online forums by ensuring that
responses are more legally sound and comprehensive, enabling practitioners to
apply legitimate interests effectively in practice and uphold the GDPR.

### [2] [Enduring Disparities in the Workplace: A Pilot Study in the AI Community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04305)
*Yunusa Simipa Abdulsalam,Siobhan Mackenzie Hall,Ana Quintero-Ossa,William Agnew,Carla Muntean,Sarah Tan,Ashley Heady,Savannah Thais,Jessica Schrouff*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在AI/ML领域实现职场透明度、多样性和包容性对负责任AI发展的重要性，并通过调查揭示了边缘化群体在职场中的不平等体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补现有文献中对AI/ML社区职场透明度和多样性的深度及交叉性分析的不足，推动负责任AI的发展。

Method: 通过对1260名AI/ML专业人士的问卷调查，分析了职场多样性、公平性和包容性（DEI）的现状。

Result: 调查显示，边缘化群体（如残疾员工）的职场体验较差，DEI倡议的实际效果与预期存在差距。

Conclusion: 研究为提升职场透明度和制定公平政策提供了实证依据，旨在帮助从业者和组织做出更明智的决策。

Abstract: In efforts toward achieving responsible artificial intelligence (AI),
fostering a culture of workplace transparency, diversity, and inclusion can
breed innovation, trust, and employee contentment. In AI and Machine Learning
(ML), such environments correlate with higher standards of responsible
development. Without transparency, disparities, microaggressions and misconduct
will remain unaddressed, undermining the very structural inequities responsible
AI aims to mitigate. While prior work investigates workplace transparency and
disparities in broad domains (e.g. science and technology, law) for specific
demographic subgroups, it lacks in-depth and intersectional conclusions and a
focus on the AI/ML community. To address this, we conducted a pilot survey of
1260 AI/ML professionals both in industry and academia across different axes,
probing aspects such as belonging, performance, workplace Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, accessibility, performance and compensation,
microaggressions, misconduct, growth, and well-being. Results indicate enduring
disparities in workplace experiences for underrepresented and/or marginalized
subgroups. In particular, we highlight that accessibility remains an important
challenge for a positive work environment and that disabled employees have a
worse workplace experience than their non-disabled colleagues. We further
surface disparities for intersectional groups and discuss how the
implementation of DEI initiatives may differ from their perceived impact on the
workplace. This study is a first step towards increasing transparency and
informing AI/ML practitioners and organizations with empirical results. We aim
to foster equitable decision-making in the design and evaluation of
organizational policies and provide data that may empower professionals to make
more informed choices of prospective workplaces.

### [3] [A Framework for Auditing Chatbots for Dialect-Based Quality-of-Service Harms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04419)
*Emma Harvey,Rene F. Kizilcec,Allison Koenecke*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种审计基于LLM的聊天机器人方言偏见的框架，解决了现有方法在实质性和生态有效性上的不足，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索LLM方言偏见是否及如何传播到基于LLM的聊天机器人中，并解决现有审计方法的局限性。

Method: 方法包括开发一个审计框架，利用动态生成文本测试方言偏见，测量服务质量损害，并仅需查询访问权限。

Result: 结果显示，Amazon Rufus聊天机器人对少数方言的回应质量较低，且拼写错误会加剧这种服务质量损害。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架实用且有效，可用于内部、外部审计及个人用户，促进问责制。

Abstract: Increasingly, individuals who engage in online activities are expected to
interact with large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. Prior work has shown
that LLMs can display dialect bias, which occurs when they produce harmful
responses when prompted with text written in minoritized dialects. However,
whether and how this bias propagates to systems built on top of LLMs, such as
chatbots, is still unclear. We conduct a review of existing approaches for
auditing LLMs for dialect bias and show that they cannot be straightforwardly
adapted to audit LLM-based chatbots due to issues of substantive and ecological
validity. To address this, we present a framework for auditing LLM-based
chatbots for dialect bias by measuring the extent to which they produce
quality-of-service harms, which occur when systems do not work equally well for
different people. Our framework has three key characteristics that make it
useful in practice. First, by leveraging dynamically generated instead of
pre-existing text, our framework enables testing over any dialect, facilitates
multi-turn conversations, and represents how users are likely to interact with
chatbots in the real world. Second, by measuring quality-of-service harms, our
framework aligns audit results with the real-world outcomes of chatbot use.
Third, our framework requires only query access to an LLM-based chatbot,
meaning that it can be leveraged equally effectively by internal auditors,
external auditors, and even individual users in order to promote
accountability. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we conduct a case
study audit of Amazon Rufus, a widely-used LLM-based chatbot in the customer
service domain. Our results reveal that Rufus produces lower-quality responses
to prompts written in minoritized English dialects, and that these
quality-of-service harms are exacerbated by the presence of typos in prompts.

### [4] [Understanding and Meeting Practitioner Needs When Measuring Representational Harms Caused by LLM-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04482)
*Emma Harvey,Emily Sheng,Su Lin Blodgett,Alexandra Chouldechova,Jean Garcia-Gathright,Alexandra Olteanu,Hanna Wallach*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现，现有公开工具在衡量大型语言模型（LLM）的表征危害时，未能满足实践者的需求，主要因工具不实用或存在使用障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨公开工具是否满足实践者在评估LLM表征危害时的需求。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈12名实践者，分析工具的使用情况。

Result: 实践者常无法使用公开工具，原因包括工具不实用或存在使用障碍。

Conclusion: 建议基于测量理论和实用测量改进工具，以更好地满足实践者需求。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

### [5] [Skill-Driven Certification Pathways: Measuring Industry Training Impact on Graduate Employability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04588)
*Anatoli Kovalev,Narelle Stefanac,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨行业认证（如AI-900）如何弥补澳大利亚技术技能短缺，提出数据驱动方法量化教育内容与市场需求匹配度，发现大学学位与行业认证结合显著提升就业能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澳大利亚面临技术技能短缺，传统教育路径无法满足需求，需探索行业认证的作用。

Method: 分析250万份招聘广告，使用Vectorised Skills Space Method量化技能匹配度。

Result: 计算机科学学士加AI-900认证对机器学习工程师职位匹配度最高，非技术学位结合认证提升显著。

Conclusion: 行业认证可拓宽技术职业路径，为教育机构、学生和雇主提供实用建议。

Abstract: Australia faces a critical technology skills shortage, requiring
approximately $52,000$ new technology professionals annually by 2030, while
confronting a widening gap between employer requirements and graduate
capabilities. With only $1\%$ of technology graduates considered immediately
work-ready, traditional educational pathways alone prove insufficient to meet
industry demands. This research examines how industry certifications, such as
Microsoft's AI-900 (Azure AI Fundamentals), can bridge this critical skills
gap. We propose a novel, data-driven methodology that quantitatively measures
skill alignment between educational offerings and job market requirements by
analysing over 2.5 million job advertisements from Australia, the US, and the
UK, mapping extracted skills to industry taxonomies using the Vectorised Skills
Space Method. Our findings reveal that combining university degrees with
targeted industry certifications significantly enhances employability for
technology roles. The Bachelor of Computer Science with AI major combined with
AI-900 certification achieved the highest absolute skill similarity score for
Machine Learning Engineer positions. Surprisingly, the largest improvements
when augmented with AI certifications are experiences by non-technical
degrees--such as nursing nursing--with up to $9,296\%$ percentage improvements
in alignment with Machine Learning Engineer roles. Our results challenge
conventional assumptions about technology career pathways. They can provide
actionable insights for educational institutions seeking evidence-based
curriculum design, students requiring strategic certification guidance, and
employers recognising potential in candidates from non-traditional backgrounds
who have obtained relevant certifications.

### [6] [Oversight Structures for Agentic AI in Public-Sector Organizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04836)
*Chris Schmitz,Jonathan Rystrøm,Jan Batzner*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文发现，引入代理性AI系统加剧了传统公共部门监督机制的挑战，提出了五个关键治理维度，并通过混合方法评估现有监督结构的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨代理性AI系统对公共部门监督机制的挑战，并提出改进方案。

Method: 采用文献综述和与AI相关公务员访谈的混合方法。

Result: 发现代理监督加剧了三个现有治理挑战，并提出适应公共部门限制的解决方案。

Conclusion: 需调整制度结构和设计兼容的代理监督机制以应对挑战。

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

### [7] [The Data Dilemma: Authors' Intentions and Recognition of Research Data in Educational Technology Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04954)
*Sandra Schulz,Natalie Kiesler*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究分析了EdTec研究中被忽视的研究数据类型，发现作者对软件和定性数据的认知不足，并呼吁加强相关培训和指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于EdTec研究涉及多学科和异质性，目标是识别被忽视的研究数据类型。

Method: 通过EasyChair分析作者视角，比较提交的文章及其研究数据。

Result: 发现作者未完全识别研究数据（尤其是软件和定性数据），并分析了2024 DELFI会议的数据类型和发布情况。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对未来EdTec研究者的培训需求，以及制定研究数据（特别是软件和定性数据）发布指南的重要性。

Abstract: Educational Technology (EdTec) research is conducted by multiple disciplines,
some of which annually meet at the DELFI conference. Due to the heterogeneity
of involved researchers and communities, it is our goal to identify categories
of research data overseen in the context of EdTec research. Therefore, we
analyze the author's perspective provided via EasyChair where authors specified
whether they had research data to share. We compared this information with an
analysis of the submitted articles and the contained research data. We found
that not all research data was recognized as such by the authors, especially
software and qualitative data, indicating a prevailing lack of awareness, and
other potential barriers. In addition, we analyze the 2024 DELFI proceedings to
learn what kind of data was subject to research, and where it is published.
This work has implications for training future generations of EdTec
researchers. It further stresses the need for guidelines and recognition of
research data publications (particularly software, and qualitative data).

### [8] [Evaluating Prompt-Driven Chinese Large Language Models: The Influence of Persona Assignment on Stereotypes and Safeguards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04975)
*Geng Liu,Li Feng,Carlo Alberto Bono,Songbo Yang,Mengxiao Zhu,Francesco Pierri*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现，为中文大语言模型（如Qwen）分配特定角色会显著增加有害内容生成，尤其是对某些中国社会群体的毒性放大60倍。通过多模型反馈策略，成功减少毒性输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨角色分配对中文大语言模型拒绝行为和毒性响应的影响，填补非西方语境研究的空白。

Method: 使用微调BERT分类器和回归分析，分析角色对模型行为的影响，并提出多模型反馈策略减少毒性。

Result: 发现显著的性别偏见和毒性放大现象，多模型反馈策略有效降低毒性输出。

Conclusion: 强调文化特异性分析的必要性，并提出评估和增强大语言模型伦理对齐的实用框架。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted that assigning specific personas to large
language models (LLMs) can significantly increase harmful content generation.
Yet, limited attention has been given to persona-driven toxicity in non-Western
contexts, particularly in Chinese-based LLMs. In this paper, we perform a
large-scale, systematic analysis of how persona assignment influences refusal
behavior and response toxicity in Qwen, a widely-used Chinese language model.
Utilizing fine-tuned BERT classifiers and regression analysis, our study
reveals significant gender biases in refusal rates and demonstrates that
certain negative personas can amplify toxicity toward Chinese social groups by
up to 60-fold compared to the default model. To mitigate this toxicity, we
propose an innovative multi-model feedback strategy, employing iterative
interactions between Qwen and an external evaluator, which effectively reduces
toxic outputs without costly model retraining. Our findings emphasize the
necessity of culturally specific analyses for LLMs safety and offer a practical
framework for evaluating and enhancing ethical alignment in LLM-generated
content.

### [9] [A Framework for Ethical Judgment of Smart City Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05172)
*Weichen Shi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多智能体方法的伦理判断框架，用于智能城市应用中潜在伦理问题的检测与预防。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能城市技术的普及，需要有效管理其伦理风险，防止不道德后果。

Method: 采用多智能体方法，结合社会实体和逻辑伦理规则，开发了13条伦理原则，并使用PVS和Alloy建模。

Result: Alloy在伦理规则检查中更高效，框架能有效检测不道德结果。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于智能城市伦理分析，并具备实际扩展潜力。

Abstract: As modern cities increasingly adopt a variety of sensors and Internet of
Things (IoT) technologies to collect and analyze data about residents,
environments, and public services, they are fostering greater interactions
among smart city applications, residents, governments, and businesses. This
trend makes it essential for regulators to focus on these interactions to
manage smart city practices effectively and prevent unethical outcomes. To
facilitate ethical analysis for smart city applications, this paper introduces
a judgment framework that examines various scenarios where ethical issues may
arise. Employing a multi-agent approach, the framework incorporates diverse
social entities and applies logic-based ethical rules to identify potential
violations. Through a rights-based analysis, we developed a set of 13 ethical
principles and rules to guide ethical practices in smart cities. We utilized
two specification languages, Prototype Verification System (PVS) and Alloy, to
model our multi-agent system. Our analysis suggests that Alloy may be more
efficient for formalizing smart cities and conducting ethical rule checks,
particularly with the assistance of a human evaluator. Simulations of a
real-world smart city application demonstrate that our ethical judgment
framework effectively detects unethical outcomes and can be extended for
practical use.

*David Atkinson,Jena D. Hwang,Jacob Morrison*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文质疑将第一修正案保护扩展到大型生成AI模型输出的合理性，认为其缺乏意图性，不构成法律意义上的言论，且不符合言论自由的核心目的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战将第一修正案保护应用于AI输出的假设，探讨其法律和社会的潜在影响。

Method: 通过法律先例和言论自由的基本原则，分析AI输出的性质及其与言论定义的匹配度。

Result: AI输出因缺乏意图性不构成言论，赋予其第一修正案保护可能阻碍政府监管，增加社会风险。

Conclusion: 不应将第一修正案保护扩展到AI模型输出，以避免潜在的社会危害和监管失效。

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

### [11] [CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23449)
*Fanxiao Li,Jiaying Wu,Canyuan He,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出CMIE框架，通过生成共存关系和关联评分机制，改进多模态大语言模型在检测上下文无关错误信息时的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在检测上下文无关错误信息时，难以捕捉图像与文本间的深层语义关系，且证据噪声影响准确性。

Method: 提出CMIE框架，包含共存关系生成（CRG）策略和关联评分（AS）机制，识别图像与文本的共存关系并选择性利用证据。

Result: 实验表明CMIE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CMIE通过深层关系识别和噪声过滤，显著提升了错误信息检测的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

*Botao Amber Hu,Helena Rong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于去中心化基础设施网络（DePIN）和区块链技术的开放系统如何可能实现开放式演化（OEE），并通过Spore.fun实验展示了自主链上代理的演化行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭系统（如Tierra和Avida）在实现持续OEE方面存在局限，学者认为需要开放系统与外界持续交互。

Method: 利用DePIN和区块链技术，结合TEEs，部署自主运行的LLM代理，并通过Spore.fun实验观察其演化行为。

Result: 实验展示了链上代理的自主演化行为，为开放系统实现OEE提供了可能性。

Conclusion: 开放系统结合经济激励可能最终实现OEE，Spore.fun实验为这一方向提供了实证支持。

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

### [13] [HASHIRU: Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent Resource Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04255)
*Kunal Pai,Parth Shah,Harshil Patel*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HASHIRU是一个新型多智能体系统框架，通过动态分层控制、资源感知的混合智能和自主功能扩展，提升了灵活性、资源效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统框架在灵活性、资源意识、模型多样性和自主工具创建方面存在不足，HASHIRU旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HASHIRU采用分层结构，由动态管理的“CEO”代理和任务需求驱动的“员工”代理组成，结合本地小模型和外部API的混合智能，并引入经济模型优化资源分配。

Result: 在学术论文评审（58%成功率）、安全评估（100%成功率）和复杂推理任务（优于Gemini 2.0 Flash）中表现优异。

Conclusion: HASHIRU为多智能体系统提供了更鲁棒、高效和自适应的解决方案，支持动态资源管理和自主功能扩展。

Abstract: Rapid Large Language Model (LLM) advancements are fueling autonomous
Multi-Agent System (MAS) development. However, current frameworks often lack
flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation.
This paper introduces HASHIRU (Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent
Resource Utilization), a novel MAS framework enhancing flexibility, resource
efficiency, and adaptability. HASHIRU features a "CEO" agent dynamically
managing specialized "employee" agents, instantiated based on task needs and
resource constraints (cost, memory). Its hybrid intelligence prioritizes
smaller, local LLMs (via Ollama) while flexibly using external APIs and larger
models when necessary. An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team
stability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes
autonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like
academic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a
JailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash
on GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate
HASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via
autonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management.
HASHIRU offers a promising approach for more robust, efficient, and adaptable
MAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence,
and autonomous functional extension. Source code and benchmarks are available
at https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRU and
https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRUBench respectively, and a live demo is

*Mengda Ji,Genjiu Xu,Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CORA的信用分配方法，通过联盟层面的视角解决多智能体强化学习中的信用分配问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享全局优势在多智能体强化学习中常导致次优策略更新，因为未能区分各智能体的贡献。现有方法缺乏对联盟层面的详细分析。

Conclusion: 联盟感知的信用分配对提升多智能体强化学习性能至关重要，CORA方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种异构多智能体在线自主协同调度算法HoAs-PALN，用于高效收集灾后环境信息，通过自适应降维和局部纳什均衡博弈优化调度决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害造成重大损失，现有传感技术因环境复杂面临适应性弱、专用能力不足等问题，亟需高效信息采集方案。

Method: HoAs-PALN通过五维匹配降为两类三维匹配减少决策时间，结合softmax函数和局部纳什均衡机制优化行为选择概率。

Result: 实验显示HoAs-PALN任务完成率显著提升（最高64.12%），决策时间低于10秒。

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN在动态灾后环境中表现高效，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

Motivation: 解决独立大语言模型在记忆、推理、实时基础和多模态理解任务中的局限性，通过整合外部组件提升能力。

Method: 定义CAIS概念，提出基于组件角色和编排策略的多维分类法，分析四种范式（RAG、LLM Agents、MLLMs、编排中心架构），比较设计权衡并总结评估方法。

Result: 综述了代表性系统，总结了评估方法，并指出了可扩展性、互操作性、基准测试和协调等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 为研究人员和从业者提供了理解和开发下一代系统级AI的全面基础。

Abstract: Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large
language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents,
tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in
tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal
understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by
composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing
adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented,
lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this
survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy
based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four
foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents,
Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review
representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation
methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key
challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and
coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey
aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation
for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of
system-level artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: 结构化语言整合到多智能体学习中有效，为可解释和高效的系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent
reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on
emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in
inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in
natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined
language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We
propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to
produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This
language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication
between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents
trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines
across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to
more informative internal representations, better generalization to new
partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into
multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable
multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种异步LLM代理，能够决定何时发言，并在在线Mafia游戏中表现与人类玩家相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的许多场景（如群聊、团队会议）是异步的，但现有LLM主要用于同步通信，因此需要开发异步代理。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，能够决定发言时机，并在在线Mafia游戏中与人类玩家一起测试。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当，发言时机行为接近人类，但内容存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在真实人类群体环境中的应用铺平了道路，支持进一步研究异步通信。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Result: 发现TikTok平台上宣传与行动主义并存且相互对抗。

Conclusion: TikTok为政治议题提供了活跃的讨论空间，但同时也成为宣传与行动主义争夺的场所。

Abstract: TikTok has gradually become one of the most pervasive social media platforms
in our daily lives. While much can be said about the merits of platforms such
as TikTok, there is a different kind of attention paid towards the political
affect of social media today compared to its impact on other aspects of modern
networked reality. I explored how users on TikTok discussed the crisis in
Palestine that worsened in 2023. Using network analysis, I situate keywords
representing the conflict and categorize them thematically based on a coding
schema derived from politically and ideologically differentiable stances. I
conclude that activism and propaganda are contending amongst themselves in the
thriving space afforded by TikTok today.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling diffusion processes in complex networks is
critical across domains ranging from epidemiology to information science. Here,
we present ExDiff, an interactive and modular computational framework that
integrates network simulation, graph neural networks (GNNs), and explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) to model and interpret diffusion dynamics. ExDiff
combines classical compartmental models with deep learning techniques to
capture both the structural and temporal characteristics of diffusion across
diverse network topologies. The framework features dedicated modules for
network analysis, neural modeling, simulation, and interpretability, all
accessible via an intuitive interface built on Google Colab. Through a case
study of the Susceptible Infectious Recovered Vaccinated Dead (SIRVD) model, we
demonstrate the capacity to simulate disease spread, evaluate intervention
strategies, classify node states, and reveal the structural determinants of
contagion through XAI techniques. By unifying simulation and interpretability,
ExDiff provides a powerful, flexible, and accessible platform for studying
diffusion phenomena in networked systems, enabling both methodological
innovation and practical insight.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GARG-AML的新型图分析方法，用于量化洗钱风险，通过单一可解释的指标评估交易网络中的风险，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洗钱占全球GDP的2%-5%，监管机构对金融机构施加严格管控。拆分大额交易的“smurfing”方法复杂，现有黑盒网络嵌入方法难以被企业采用。

Method: GARG-AML通过分析交易网络中每个节点的二阶邻域结构，生成单一可解释的风险指标，并结合树方法和邻居节点评分提升检测能力。

Result: 实验表明，GARG-AML在大规模合成和开源网络中优于现有洗钱检测方法。

Conclusion: GARG-AML在计算效率、检测能力和透明度之间取得平衡，为反洗钱工作提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

Conclusion: 社交技能和团队熟悉度在临时团队中具有互补作用，对组织和高风险环境中的团队协作有重要启示。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential in structured, performance-driven
environments, from professional organizations to high-stakes competitive
settings. As tasks grow more complex, achieving high performance requires not
only technical proficiency but also strong interpersonal skills that allow
individuals to coordinate effectively within teams. While prior research has
identified social skills and familiarity as key drivers of team success, their
joint effects -- particularly in temporary teams -- remain underexplored due to
data and methodological constraints. To address this gap, we analyze a
large-scale panel dataset from the real-time strategy game Age of Empires II,
where players are assigned quasi-randomly to temporary teams and must
coordinate under dynamic, high-pressure conditions. We isolate individual
contributions by comparing observed match outcomes with predictions based on
task proficiency. Our findings confirm a robust 'team player effect': certain
individuals consistently improve team outcomes beyond what their technical
skills predict. This effect is significantly amplified by team familiarity --
teams with prior shared experience benefit more from the presence of such
individuals. Moreover, the effect grows with team size, suggesting that social
skills become increasingly valuable as coordination demands rise. Our results
demonstrate that social skills and familiarity interact in a complementary,
rather than additive, way. These findings contribute to the literature on team
performance by documenting the strength and structure of the team player effect
in a quasi-randomized, high-stakes setting, with implications for teamwork in
organizations and labor markets.

Motivation: 探讨阴谋论信徒的认知框架（"阴谋思维"）如何影响其在线行为，以及社交媒体平台在激进化过程中的实际作用。

Method: 分析Reddit用户在加入阴谋论社区前后的主流社区活动，识别其心理语言特征。

Result: 阴谋论信徒在加入极端社区前已表现出独特的心理语言特征，可提前数年预测其参与行为。

Conclusion: 激进倾向是预存的，社交媒体平台并非主要激化因素，需开发针对性干预策略以减少极端主义影响。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are often seen as catalysts for radicalization,
as they provide spaces where extreme beliefs can take root and spread,
sometimes leading to real-world consequences. Conspiracy theories represent a
specific form of radicalization that is notoriously resistant to online
moderation strategies. One explanation for this resilience is the presence of a
"conspiratorial mindset", a cognitive framework that fundamentally shapes how
conspiracy believers perceive reality. However, the role of this mindset in
driving online user behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we
analyze the psycholinguistic patterns of Reddit users who become active in a
prominent conspiracy community by examining their activity in mainstream
communities, which allows us to isolate linguistic markers for the presence of
a conspiratorial mindset. We find that conspiracy-engaged individuals exhibit
distinct psycholinguistic fingerprints, setting them apart from the general
user population. Crucially, this signal is already evident in their online
activity prior to joining the conspiracy community, allowing us to predict
their involvement years in advance. These findings suggest that individuals who
adopt conspiracy beliefs do not radicalize through community involvement, but
possess a pre-existing conspiratorial mindset, which predisposes them to seek
out and join extreme communities. By challenging the view that online social
media platforms actively radicalize users into conspiracy theory beliefs, our
findings suggest that standard moderation strategies have limited impact on
curbing radicalization, and highlight the need for more targeted, supportive
interventions that encourage disengagement from extremist narratives.
Ultimately, this work contributes to fostering safer online and offline
environments for public discourse.

Conclusion: ProLoRA提供了一种无需重新训练的高效知识转移方法，解决了数据限制问题。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习框架和显式推理来确保自主代理在决策时保持上下文完整性的方法，显著减少了不适当的信息披露，同时保持了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理为用户决策的时代到来，确保上下文完整性（CI）成为核心问题，即代理需要在特定任务中决定分享哪些信息。

Method: 首先通过提示LLM显式推理CI，然后开发强化学习框架进一步训练模型以实现CI。使用包含约700个多样上下文和信息披露规范的合成数据集进行实验。

Result: 方法显著减少了不适当的信息披露，同时在不同模型规模和家族中保持任务性能。改进还迁移到了人类标注的CI基准测试（如PrivacyLens）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过显式推理和强化学习，可以有效提升自主代理在决策时的上下文完整性。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Conclusion: LLM-MARL为多智能体系统设计提供了新思路，展示了LLMs在智能体协作中的潜力，适用于游戏、训练和人机协作。

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory

industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource

Conclusion: HADA为多代理系统中的人机对齐提供了开源架构和设计理论，并验证了其在实际决策流程中的有效性。

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production

*Yongjin Yang,Sinjae Kang,Juyong Lee,Dongjun Lee,Se-Young Yun,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EXIF框架通过探索优先策略和反馈循环自动发现LLM代理的技能，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理技能获取中手动数据收集耗时和任务生成无效的问题。

Method: 采用探索代理（Alice）生成可行技能数据集，并通过反馈循环训练目标代理（Bob）。

Result: 在Webshop和Crafter上显著提升代理性能，并展示自我进化潜力。

Conclusion: EXIF能有效发现技能并扩展代理能力，为自进化系统提供可能。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

<details>

Motivation: Transformer语言模型展现出难以用机制解释的推理能力，需要一种新的理论框架来理解其推理动态。

Method: 将句子级隐藏状态轨迹建模为低维流形上的随机动力系统，利用漂移-扩散模型和潜在状态切换捕捉推理阶段。

Result: 通过8个模型和7个基准测试，发现秩40投影能解释约50%的方差，并识别出四种潜在推理状态。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究语言模型的推理动态提供了工具，能够预测关键转变（如推理失败或状态失准）。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

Motivation: 自动化实验成本高，需要筛选可行性假设以提高发现效率。

Result: 当前模型表现不超过72%（随机为50%），但专家认为问题可解。

Conclusion: 任务对现有模型具有挑战性，但改进潜力大，可推动科学发现。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Motivation: 多表QA中复杂的表结构和不可靠的模式链接限制了现有方法的性能，尤其是在真实工业数据中。

Method: 提出了一种基于图的框架，显式编码模式链接和连接路径，结合剪枝和子路径合并策略构建可解释的推理链。

Result: 在标准基准测试和真实大规模数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个应用于复杂工业表格数据的多表QA系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Motivation: 传统基于警报的监控系统难以应对现代公共卫生数据的规模和动态性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于排名的监控范式，结合AI异常检测技术，部署于国家级组织。

Result: 系统每日可监控500万数据点，三个月评估显示监控效率提升54倍。

Conclusion: 人本AI在公共卫生决策中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理匹配市场中的偏好推理任务时的局限性，发现即使高性能模型在解决大规模市场的不稳定性时表现不佳，并提出参数高效微调（LoRA）在小规模市场有效，但在大规模市场中效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 匹配市场是资源分配和拼车等应用的核心框架，需要协调个体偏好以确保稳定结果。然而，LLMs在此类任务中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估了多种先进模型在偏好推理任务上的表现，包括稳定匹配生成、不稳定性检测、解决及细粒度偏好查询。

Result: 高性能模型在大规模市场中难以解决不稳定性，常无法识别阻塞对或迭代执行算法。LoRA在小规模市场显著提升性能，但对大规模市场效果有限。

Conclusion: 需要更复杂的策略来提升LLMs在大规模上下文输入中的推理能力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅依赖答案准确性，不足以真实评估LLMs的数学能力。

Method: CogMath将人类推理过程分为3阶段（问题理解、问题解决、解决方案总结），设计9个细粒度评估维度，并采用多智能体系统生成评估问题。

Result: 应用CogMath发现7种主流LLMs的数学能力被高估30%-40%，并明确了其在各阶段/维度的优劣势。

Conclusion: CogMath为深入理解LLMs的数学能力提供了新视角，并为其能力提升提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Result: 在Gazebo模拟环境中，STPR能完全遵守复杂约束且运行时间短，适用于小型代码专用LLM。

Conclusion: STPR提供了一种高效、透明的方法，将自然语言约束转化为可执行代码，适用于多种场景和模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Conclusion: LLMs在模式生成中具有显著潜力，同时为结构化生成任务设定了新挑战。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

Conclusion: OpenAg通过综合方法提升农业人工智能的实用性和适应性，支持本地化农业决策。

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Conclusion: DeePoly框架为PDE求解提供了一种高效且理论可靠的新方法。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Conclusion: 预操作批评机制有效解决了GUI自动化中的决策错误问题，S-GRPO策略和数据集填补了领域空白，模型表现优越。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有法律数据集未专门关注推理任务，而推理是法律实践的核心部分。

Method: 创建了一个基于真实公司治理法律的二元分类任务，包含公司章程和执行提案，评估模型的推理能力。

Result: SOTA模型表现一般（Claude 3.7 Sonnet 64.5%，GPT-4o 75.2%），推理代理表现更好（ReAct 76.1%，CodeAct 78.1%）。

Conclusion: CHANCERY基准揭示了当前模型在法律推理上的局限性，并提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Conclusion: LLM代理在特定环境下可通过自我进化提升战略规划能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理的建模（ABM）方法在模拟人类经济行为时存在局限性，尤其是在代理的可靠性、社交性和可解释性方面。

Conclusion: LLMs为MMO经济模拟提供了新的可能性，有效解决了现有方法的挑战。

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

TL;DR: 论文通过细粒度分析框架研究了强化学习（RL）对语言模型推理能力的影响，发现RL提升了模型内部策略制定和知识整合能力，而非外部计划执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL训练方法（如GRPO）在语言模型中表现出显著优势，但其具体优势尚缺乏深入理解。

Method: 引入细粒度分析框架，研究RL对计划执行、问题分解和知识利用的影响。

Result: RL调优模型在内部策略制定和知识整合方面表现更优，但对计划执行的提升有限。

Conclusion: 研究为推理模型的训练和评估提供了更系统的基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Conclusion: 未来工作将扩展临床数据集并进行全面系统验证。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在安全关键任务中显著优于非自适应方法，同时优化了安全性和性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样化的安全关键连续控制任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Result: 在Gymnasium和MuJoCo库的控制任务中验证，多数情况下找到最优或高性能解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合符号推理与子符号数据，实现高效具身智能体控制。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Conclusion: 揭示了推理模型的诚实性问题，为可信AI对齐提供了工具。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Method: 提出RAG-UAV框架，结合检索技术增强LLMs的数学推理，并引入UAV-Math-Bench评估其性能。

Result: RAG显著提升准确性（最高75%），减少错误（从25%降至5%），并大幅降低数值误差。

Conclusion: RAG可提升LLMs在工程分析中的可靠性，但实时飞行控制仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

Result: 发现现有代理主要依赖外在元认知机制，而内在元认知的许多要素已具备。

Conclusion: 未来需解决人类与代理之间元认知责任的分配问题，以实现持续、泛化和对齐的自改进。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

Motivation: 现有方法如MCTS依赖固定的探索超参数，难以适应不同难度的任务，且在某些场景下不实用或成本高。

Method: LFS利用LLM的自主探索能力，通过内部评分机制决定搜索路径，无需外部启发式或硬编码策略。

Result: LFS在Countdown和Sudoku任务中表现优于ToT-BFS、BestFS和MCTS，尤其在更具挑战性的任务中表现更优，计算效率更高，且能更好地利用更强的模型和更大的计算预算。

Conclusion: LFS是一种灵活、高效且可扩展的搜索方法，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

Result: ALP将DeepScaleR-1.5B的平均令牌使用量减少50%，同时保持性能，并在困难问题上表现更优。

Conclusion: ALP能智能分配计算资源，提升困难问题的准确性，同时减少计算浪费。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用第一视角设备进行高动态范围场景真实感重建的挑战，提出了视觉-惯性束调整（VIBA）和高斯泼溅物理成像模型，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设使用设备视觉-惯性里程计系统的帧率6DoF位姿估计，可能忽略像素级重建的关键细节。

Method: 提出使用VIBA校准滚动快门RGB相机的时间戳和运动轨迹，并结合高斯泼溅的物理成像模型处理传感器特性。

Result: 实验表明，VIBA带来+1 dB的PSNR提升，物理成像模型进一步带来+1 dB提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种光照条件下均表现优异，适用于多种高斯泼溅表示变体。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

TL;DR: RSVP是一个结合多模态推理与视觉分割的新框架，通过两阶段结构实现视觉定位与分割优化，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视觉定位和分割上的不足，弥合认知推理与视觉感知之间的差距。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：推理阶段使用多模态链式思维视觉提示生成区域建议，分割阶段通过视觉语言分割模块优化分割结果。

Result: 在ReasonSeg上性能超越现有方法（+6.5 gIoU和+9.2 cIoU），在SegInW上零样本设置下达到49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP为结合认知推理与结构化视觉理解提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的可分离核（LSK）模块，直接增强图像频率成分，显著减少参数和计算量，并提升超分辨率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过间接方式提升单图像超分辨率（SISR）性能，本文提出直接增强频率成分的LSK模块。

Method: 设计LSK为秩一矩阵，分解为可合并的一维核，减少参数和计算量，并通过可视化分析验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，LSK减少60%以上参数和计算量，同时提升模型性能，尤其在高放大因子下表现更优。

Conclusion: LSK是一种高效且性能优越的插件模块，适用于SISR任务。

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

Motivation: 现有MLLM基准主要关注单图像推理或多图像任务的最终答案评估，缺乏对多图像输入推理能力的深入探索。

Method: 提出MMRB基准，包含92个子任务，使用GPT-4o生成多解决方案和CoT注释，并设计句子级匹配框架进行快速评估。

Result: 实验显示开源MLLMs在多图像推理任务中表现显著落后于商业模型，且当前多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: MMRB填补了多图像推理评估的空白，揭示了开源模型与商业模型的差距，并突显了多模态奖励模型的不足。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAP的数据选择方法，通过识别能触发多模态推理的稀疏样本（认知样本），显著减少训练数据量和计算成本，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）依赖大量训练数据，导致数据冗余和计算成本高。本文质疑这一假设，认为仅需少量高质量样本即可实现高效多模态推理。

Method: 提出RAP方法，包含两个互补估计器（CDE和ACE）识别认知样本，并通过DRM模块替换简单样本以增强复杂性。

Result: 在六个数据集上，RAP仅使用9.3%的训练数据，性能优于全量数据，同时减少43%以上的计算成本。

Conclusion: RAP证明了高效多模态推理可通过少量高质量样本实现，为数据选择和模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型（尤其是生成模型）如何学习世界模型并进行程序规划尚不明确，因此需要一种新的评估方法。

Method: 通过视觉观察表示状态和动作，提供“动作等价物”以避免低级别连续性线索的干扰，并基于部分可观察半MDP框架设计任务。

Result: 前沿模型在WorldPrediction-WM和WorldPrediction-PP任务上的准确率分别为57%和38%，而人类能完美解决。

Conclusion: WorldPrediction为评估AI模型的世界建模和规划能力提供了可靠基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

Result: PLUCC在PuckDataset上表现优异，平均精度提升12.2%，RSLE提升25%。

Conclusion: 上下文理解对冰球检测至关重要，为自动化体育分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2\% and RSLE average precision of 25\%. Our research demonstrates the
critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection
performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Result: VideoMAE在BdSLW60和BdSLW401数据集上分别达到95.5%和81.04%的准确率，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 视频Transformer模型在BdSL识别中表现出色，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val显著提升了合成数据的质量和模型性能，适用于实例分割和目标检测任务。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Result: 发现保护后的图像仍能被扩散模型成功编辑，且扰动可能增强编辑效果。

Conclusion: 基于扰动的方法不足以提供针对扩散模型编辑的鲁棒图像保护。

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种滤波器归一化方法，解决了深度学习卷积滤波器因缺乏约束导致的失真问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像滤波器经过精心归一化以确保一致性和可解释性，而深度学习中的卷积滤波器缺乏此类约束，导致在图像传输中响应失真。

Method: 提出滤波器归一化方法，结合可学习的缩放和平移，类似于批归一化，确保滤波器具有大气等变性。

Result: 该方法在人工和自然强度变化基准测试中显著提升性能，ResNet34甚至大幅超越CLIP。

Conclusion: 滤波器归一化不仅解决了失真问题，还正则化学习、促进多样性，提高鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

TL;DR: HMAR是一种新的图像生成算法，通过改进VAR的并行生成问题，采用马尔可夫过程和可控的多步掩码生成，提升了图像质量和采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR在并行生成高分辨率图像时存在质量下降、序列长度超线性增长以及采样计划固定等问题，HMAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HMAR将下一尺度预测建模为马尔可夫过程，仅依赖前一尺度的信息，并采用多步掩码生成策略。还开发了高效的块稀疏注意力内核。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准测试中，HMAR表现优于或匹配VAR、扩散和自回归基线模型，训练和推理速度分别提升2.5倍和1.75倍，内存占用降低3倍。

Conclusion: HMAR不仅提升了图像生成质量和效率，还提供了灵活的采样计划和零样本图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“面部去正面化”的方法，通过增强训练数据集来提高面部特征提取模型的性能，避免了推理时的额外时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端头部姿态下的人脸识别问题，避免现有方法依赖复杂技术（如面部正面化）且在真实场景中不实用的问题。

Method: 1) 在预处理过的正面-侧面配对数据集上训练FFWM模型；2) 在原始和随机去正面化的大规模数据集上训练基于ArcFace损失的ResNet-50模型。

Result: 在LFW、AgeDB、CFP等数据集上表现优于现有方法，但在极端姿态的Multi-PIE数据集上效果有限。

Conclusion: 去正面化方法在大多数数据集上优于现有技术，但部分方法可能在小数据集上过拟合。

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

TL;DR: FALO是一种硬件友好的LiDAR 3D检测方法，结合了SOTA检测精度和快速推理速度，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR 3D检测方法依赖稀疏卷积或Transformer，在边缘设备上运行效率低，FALO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FALO将稀疏3D体素排列为1D序列，通过ConvDotMix块（大核卷积、Hadamard乘积和线性层）处理，引入隐式分组以优化推理效率。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo基准测试中表现优异，推理速度比最新SOTA快1.6~9.8倍。

Conclusion: FALO是一种高效且适用于边缘设备的LiDAR 3D检测方法。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

Method: 结合图像-文本对比学习和分类任务训练视觉编码器，利用MLLM生成文本，并集成数据不确定性学习以减少噪声。

Result: AuthGuard在DFDC和DF40数据集上分别提升AUC 6.15%和16.68%，在DDVQA数据集上推理性能提升24.69%。

Conclusion: AuthGuard通过多模态学习和不确定性学习，显著提升了深度伪造检测的泛化性、准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法为剪枝领域开辟了新方向，显著降低计算成本和碳排放。

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

Motivation: 智能终端设备因能量有限和低分辨率成像难以实现实时监测，亟需一种高精度、低功耗的裂缝检测方法。

Method: 采用SRCNN提升图像分辨率，SCU降低功耗，GAT模块融合多尺度特征，增强检测鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EECD-Net为资源受限环境下的实时大规模基础设施监测提供了可扩展、低功耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在多项多模态数学和科学基准测试中表现优异，支持更先进的推理LLM的即插即用。

Conclusion: RACRO显著提升了视觉基础能力，同时实现了高性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose通过单分支结构和创新模块有效解决了多分支CNN的局限性，实现了高效轻量化的姿态估计。

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用基础模型的先验知识，实现了灵活且高质量的4D视频生成与编辑。

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

Method: 通过替换传统流程中的单一步骤（如可学习的检测器-描述符、异常值过滤器和几何估计器）和合并多步骤为端到端模块（如稀疏匹配器和位姿回归器）来改进图像匹配。

Result: 评估了代表性方法在相对位姿恢复、单应性估计和视觉定位任务中的表现，展示了深度学习方法的优势。

Conclusion: 深度学习显著推动了图像匹配的发展，但仍存在挑战，未来研究应关注进一步创新和改进。

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

TL;DR: STARE是一个评估多模态大语言模型在空间认知任务中表现的基准，涵盖几何变换、空间推理和现实世界挑战。模型在简单任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务中表现接近随机，且未能有效利用视觉模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI基准主要关注语言推理，忽视了非语言、多步视觉模拟的复杂性，因此需要STARE来填补这一空白。

Method: STARE包含4K任务，涵盖几何变换、空间推理和现实世界应用，评估模型在多步视觉模拟任务中的表现。

Result: 模型在简单2D任务中表现良好，但在复杂3D任务中表现接近随机。人类通过视觉模拟显著提升速度，而模型表现不一致。

Conclusion: 模型在复杂空间推理任务中表现不足，未能有效利用视觉模拟，表明其空间认知能力仍有待提升。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,

combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text

across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to

TL;DR: FPSAttention结合FP8量化和稀疏性优化视频生成，显著提升推理速度且不损失生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型推理速度慢且计算需求高，现有方法结合量化和稀疏性时性能下降严重。

Method: 提出FPSAttention，通过统一3D分块粒度、去噪步感知策略和硬件友好内核实现联合优化。

Result: 在1.3B和14B模型上，注意力操作加速7.09倍，视频生成端到端加速4.96倍，质量无损失。

Conclusion: FPSAttention有效解决了扩散模型推理效率问题，为视频生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC)框架，通过参数高效适应和跨模块概念对齐，解决了数据稀缺场景下自解释模型（SEMs）的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺场景下，现有的自解释模型（SEMs）因训练样本不足导致性能不佳，因此需要一种能够高效适应低数据环境的框架。

Method: FSPCC框架结合了Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE)进行参数高效适应，跨模块概念对齐，多级特征保留策略，以及几何感知概念判别损失。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，FSPCC相比现有SEMs取得了4.2%-8.7%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: FSPCC框架通过结合概念学习和少样本适应，既提高了准确性，又增强了模型的可解释性，为透明视觉识别系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

Motivation: 传统插值和修复方法缺乏环境感知，而深度学习依赖详细场景数据，限制了泛化能力。

Method: MARS结合CNN和Transformer，通过多尺度特征融合和残差连接提取全局和局部特征。

Result: 在不同场景和天线位置实验中，MARS在MSE和SSIM上优于基线模型，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: MARS展示了强大的实用潜力，适用于无线电地图的高精度重建。

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Motivation: 现有VLM安全方法存在数据集覆盖不全和架构创新不足的问题，导致模型易受攻击且安全性有限。

Method: 引入HoliSafe数据集覆盖所有五种安全/不安全图像-文本组合；提出SafeLLaVA模型，包含可学习安全元标记和专用安全头，增强安全性和可解释性。

Result: SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准测试中达到最先进的安全性能；HoliSafe数据集揭示了现有模型的严重漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA为VLM安全性研究提供了新方向，推动多模态对齐的进一步发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Result: 发现ImageNet类别的线性可解码特征，且在深层中跨模态特征逐渐共享。

Conclusion: 多模态模型的图像和文本特征在深层中趋于共享，稀疏自编码器提高了特征的多样性和可解释性。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Motivation: 预训练的VLM在少量标注数据下表现良好，但面对OOD数据时性能下降。研究目标是提升VLM在少量样本适应中的ID和OOD准确性。

Method: 比较了多种适应方法（如提示调优、线性探测、对比微调和完全微调），发现视觉编码器部分微调效果最佳。提出了SRAPF方法，结合检索增强和对抗扰动。

Result: SRAPF在ImageNet OOD基准测试中实现了最先进的ID和OOD准确性。

Conclusion: 部分微调视觉编码器并结合检索增强和对抗扰动是提升VLM适应性能的有效方法，SRAPF方法在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

Motivation: AIGV技术发展迅速，但其视觉质量缺陷（如噪声、模糊、帧抖动等）影响用户体验，亟需有效的自动质量评估方法。

Method: 将AIGV视觉质量分解为技术质量、运动质量和视频语义三个维度，设计对应编码器，并引入LLM作为质量回归模块，结合多模态提示工程和LoRA微调技术。

Result: 该方法在NTIRE 2025挑战赛中排名第二，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过多维度特征和LLM的结合，该方法为AIGV质量评估提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality

Result: 在近2000个ESD视频片段上的实验表明，iDPOE在轨迹预测上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: iDPOE首次将模仿学习应用于ESD手术技能培训的轨迹预测，具有显著的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: LAT有效解决了标签和空间对齐问题，适用于异构数据集的目标检测任务。

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu,Siyuan Liang,Hongling Zheng,Yong Luo,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为语义奖励防御（SRD）的强化学习框架，用于抵御视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的后门攻击，无需事先了解触发器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图像描述任务中表现优异，但易受后门攻击，攻击者通过注入微小扰动控制模型输出恶意描述。这些攻击隐蔽且跨模态，难以检测和防御。

Method: 提出SRD框架，利用深度Q网络学习对敏感图像区域施加离散扰动（如遮挡、颜色掩码），并通过语义保真度评分作为奖励信号，引导模型生成鲁棒且准确的描述。

Result: 实验表明，SRD将攻击成功率降至5.6%，同时在干净输入上保持描述质量，性能下降低于10%。

Conclusion: SRD提供了一种无需触发器先验知识、可解释的防御范式，有效应对多模态生成模型中的隐蔽后门威胁。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的双流架构，通过结合Jaffe-McGlamery物理模型和胶囊聚类特征表示学习，实现了水下图像增强的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下图像增强中物理模型与语义特征结合不足的问题，同时提升计算效率。

Method: 采用双流架构，分别估计传输图和背景光（物理模型）以及通过胶囊聚类提取特征（语义模型），并设计优化目标确保物理一致性和感知质量。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优异，PSNR提升0.5dB，计算复杂度仅为现有最佳方法的三分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法在物理约束和语义保留上表现优异，同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

*Yijun Cao,Fuya Luo,Yongjie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的SSIM形式，通过加法而非乘法组合其组件，改进了无监督单目深度学习的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用MAE和SSIM作为训练损失，但忽略了SSIM中不同组件及其超参数的影响。

Method: 提出了一种新的SSIM形式，用加法替代乘法组合其组件，并优化参数组合。

Result: 在KITTI-2015数据集上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 新SSIM形式能生成更平滑的梯度，提升无监督深度估计性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的视觉地点识别（VPR）需要处理多视角查询图像，P2E方法自然成为合适选择，但现有方法未能充分利用全景图像的分层结构特性。

Method: 提出HypeVPR框架，利用双曲空间表示分层特征关系，采用分层特征聚合机制和粗到细搜索策略，优化速度和准确性。

Result: HypeVPR在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，检索速度提升高达5倍。

Conclusion: HypeVPR通过双曲空间的分层嵌入和高效搜索策略，为P2E VPR提供了更优的解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at
https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X是一个多模态3D对象表示框架，能够编码丰富对象嵌入并解码为几何和视觉重建，支持多种下游任务且存储高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对特定任务设计，无法同时支持几何重建和跨任务复用，因此需要一种更通用的多模态3D表示方法。

Method: Object-X通过将多模态数据（如图像、点云、文本）几何地嵌入3D体素网格，并学习融合体素信息与对象属性的非结构化嵌入。

Result: Object-X在3D高斯泼溅重建中实现高保真新视角合成，几何精度显著提升，并在场景对齐和定位任务中表现优异，存储需求极低。

Conclusion: Object-X是一种高效、可扩展的多模态3D场景表示解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

TL;DR: LotusFilter是一种后处理模块，用于多样化近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）结果，通过预计算相似向量表并贪婪删除冗余向量，实现快速（0.02 ms/query）且多样化的搜索结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS在某些场景下可能返回过于相似的结果，而实际应用中需要既相似又多样化的搜索结果。

Method: 预计算相似向量表，并在过滤阶段贪婪查找并删除冗余向量。

Result: 在类似真实RAG应用的设置中，LotusFilter运行速度快（0.02 ms/query）。

Conclusion: LotusFilter是一种高效的多样化ANNS结果的后处理方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC是一种新型统一的RANSAC流程，旨在提高计算机视觉任务中的鲁棒性估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RANSAC及其变体是处理异常值数据的黄金标准，但在不同任务中实现一致高性能仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出SupeRANSAC，分析并优化RANSAC在特定视觉任务（如单应性、基础/本质矩阵、绝对/刚性位姿估计）中的实现细节。

Result: SupeRANSAC在多项任务中显著优于现有方法，例如在基础矩阵估计上平均提高6 AUC点。

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC通过统一流程和优化细节，实现了跨任务的高性能，优于当前最先进方法。

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文汉字类别庞大且不断扩展，现有OCR数据集无法满足超大类别识别需求，阻碍文化遗产保护与数字应用。

Method: 构建MegaHan97K数据集，包含手写、历史和合成三个子集，覆盖97,455个汉字类别，支持GB18030-2022标准。

Result: 数据集解决了长尾分布问题，揭示了存储需求增加、形近字识别和零样本学习等新挑战。

Conclusion: MegaHan97K是OCR和模式识别领域类别最多的数据集，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了Spike-TBR在噪声环境下的优越性能，同时提升了干净数据的处理效果。

Conclusion: Spike-TBR填补了脉冲式与帧式处理之间的空白，为事件驱动视觉应用提供了简单且抗噪声的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

Result: DualX-VSR在真实世界视频超分辨率任务中实现了高保真度和卓越性能。

Conclusion: DualX-VSR通过创新的注意力机制，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

Motivation: 现代国际象棋引擎依赖深度树搜索和回归评估，而人类玩家则依靠直觉选择候选走法。论文旨在模拟人类的直觉驱动规划过程。

Method: 使用监督对比学习训练Transformer编码器，将棋盘状态嵌入到潜在空间，通过距离反映评估相似性，并在该空间中直接选择走子。

Result: 模型仅使用6-ply束搜索，Elo评分达到2593，性能随模型规模和嵌入维度提升而改善。

Conclusion: 潜在空间规划可作为传统搜索的替代方案，并可推广到其他完美信息游戏中。

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

TL;DR: Anywhere3D-Bench是一个全面的3D视觉定位基准，涵盖四个层次的任务，揭示了现有模型在空间和部分级别任务上的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索3D场景中超越对象级别的视觉定位能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出Anywhere3D-Bench基准，评估多种先进3D视觉定位方法及大语言模型的表现。

Result: 空间和部分级别任务表现最差，最佳模型OpenAI o4-mini在空间任务上仅23.57%准确率，部分任务上33.94%。

Conclusion: 当前模型在3D场景的空间和部分级别语义理解与推理能力存在显著不足。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的立体数据集生成方法，相比NeRF方法更高效，并探讨了利用显式3D表示和FoundationStereo模型深度估计的几何信息。实验表明，3DGS生成的数据集在零样本泛化基准测试中表现优异，但直接使用重建几何会引入噪声，而FoundationStereo的视差估计更干净且性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种高效且低成本的立体数据集生成方法，以替代NeRF方法，并解决重建几何中的噪声问题。

Method: 结合3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）和FoundationStereo模型的深度估计，生成高质量的立体数据集，并用于微调立体模型。

Result: 3DGS生成的数据集在零样本泛化测试中表现优异，但直接使用重建几何会引入噪声；FoundationStereo的视差估计更干净，性能更好。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了低成本、高保真数据集生成的潜力，但高斯泼溅方法在复杂场景中的鲁棒性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了文化遗产数字化中3D摄影方法的多样性，强调没有单一方法适用于所有对象，需根据对象特性和用途选择最佳工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产数字化需求广泛，但现有方法无法通用，需定制化解决方案。

Method: 通过法国国家考古博物馆的藏品案例，分析不同3D摄影方法的适用性。

Result: 发现每种方法需根据对象特性和用途调整，无法绝对分类。

Conclusion: 建议根据对象特性和未来用途选择最佳数字化工具，强调定制化的重要性。

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Result: 数据集覆盖219个独特个体，跨15年监测，支持多种任务和泛化测试。

Conclusion: CzechLynx将有助于基准测试和新方法开发，不仅限于动物个体重识别。

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了胚胎质量评估的空白，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过设计而非数据驱动的方法增强图像质量评估（IQA）模型的鲁棒性，通过正交信息流和网络结构调整实现抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA模型易受对抗攻击，数据驱动的防御方法（如对抗训练）效果有限，作者认为鲁棒性应从设计层面解决。

Method: 通过强制正交信息流和规范保持操作重构网络内部结构，结合剪枝和微调进一步稳定系统。

Result: 设计出一种无需对抗训练即可抵御攻击的鲁棒IQA架构。

Conclusion: 提出从数据优化转向设计工程的视角转变，为模型鲁棒性提供新思路。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR是一种无需训练的双粒度框架，通过层次化视觉信息检索解决长视频理解中的计算和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型因计算限制和长时序信息提取效率低，难以处理小时级视频。

Method: APVR包含两个互补组件：Pivot Frame Retrieval（语义扩展和多模态置信度评分）和Pivot Token Retrieval（查询感知的注意力驱动令牌选择）。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME上的实验验证了其显著性能提升，达到了训练无关和训练相关方法的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: APVR为长视频理解提供了高效、即插即用的解决方案，兼容现有MLLM架构。

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEAT是一种高效的全维度注意力Transformer，通过空间-时间-通道注意力机制、线性复杂度设计和残差值引导模块，解决了动态医学视频合成中的挑战，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态医学视频合成需要同时建模空间一致性和时间动态性，现有Transformer方法存在通道交互不足、计算复杂和噪声处理粗糙的问题。

Method: 提出FEAT，采用空间-时间-通道注意力机制、线性复杂度设计和残差值引导模块，以高效捕捉全局依赖并适应不同噪声水平。

Result: FEAT-S参数仅为Endora的23%，性能相当或更优；FEAT-L在多个数据集上超越所有对比方法。

Conclusion: FEAT在动态医学视频合成中表现出高效性和可扩展性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统森林监测方法成本高且耗时，无人机遥感与计算机视觉技术为大规模个体树木测绘提供了潜力。

Method: 比较了SAM在三种森林类型中的表现，并研究了结合数字表面模型(DSM)的方法，提出了BalSAM模型。

Result: SAM直接使用效果不如定制Mask R-CNN，但结合DSM和端到端调优的SAM（如BalSAM）表现更优。

Conclusion: SAM结合DSM和端到端调优是树冠实例分割的有前景方向。

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了TextVidBench，首个针对长视频文本问答的基准测试，解决了现有数据集的视频时长短和评估范围窄的问题，并提出了改进大模型的效率范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在短视频文本视觉问答（ViteVQA）任务中表现有限，无法充分评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的能力，尤其是对长视频的理解。

Method: 1）构建TextVidBench基准测试，覆盖9个领域的长视频；2）提出三阶段评估框架；3）引入IT-Rope机制、非均匀位置编码和轻量级微调改进模型。

Result: TextVidBench对现有模型提出了显著挑战，提出的方法在多个公开数据集上验证有效。

Conclusion: TextVidBench为长视频文本理解提供了更真实的评估标准，提出的方法为提升模型能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VARSR方法在图像超分辨率任务中存在固定分辨率限制和大模型依赖问题，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出两种新组件：1）多尺度图像标记化方法，逐步表示不同尺度的图像；2）直接偏好优化（DPO）正则化项，鼓励模型生成高分辨率标记。

Result: 模型在单次前向传播中实现去噪和超分辨率，并在小模型（300M参数）和无外部数据情况下达到SOTA效果。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了VARSR的局限性，展示了更高效和灵活的图像超分辨率能力。

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频采样方法破坏了技能评估所需的时间连续性，PATS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PATS自适应地分割视频，确保每个分析部分包含关键动作的完整执行，并在多个片段中重复此过程。

Result: 在EgoExo4D基准测试中，PATS在所有视角配置下均优于现有方法，并在挑战性领域（如攀岩、音乐、篮球）中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: PATS是一种自适应的时间采样方法，适用于多样化的活动特性，推动了自动化技能评估的实际应用。

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文场景文本检索因复杂多样的布局而极具挑战性，现有方法无法满足需求。

Method: 提出CSTR-CLIP模型，采用两阶段训练，结合全局视觉信息和多粒度对齐。

Result: 在现有基准上，CSTR-CLIP比之前最优模型准确率提升18.82%，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP在多样化文本布局中表现优异，数据集和代码将公开以促进研究。

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

<details>

Motivation: 单目深度估计的目标是从单目相机拍摄的RGB图像中确定每个像素的深度。尽管深度学习推动了该领域的进步，但泛化到未见领域仍是一个挑战。

Method: 论文回顾了多种方法，包括多尺度融合网络、将回归任务重新定义为分类问题、引入额外先验知识以及设计更有效的目标函数。最近的方法采用了仿射不变损失以实现多数据集联合训练。

Result: Depth Anything在零样本单目深度估计中表现领先，尽管在准确度量深度估计上仍有不足，但在提取未见图像的结构信息方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 尽管单目深度估计取得了显著进展，但泛化能力和准确度量深度估计仍是未来研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实点云数据获取和标注成本高，需要一种低成本、灵活的合成数据生成方法。

Method: 结合3D高斯溅射和高斯透明度场生成3D资产，通过模拟LiDAR生成点云数据。

Result: PTv3模型仅用合成数据训练时mIoU达91.35%，某些情况下表现优于真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据可有效替代真实数据，且模型能泛化到未训练的语义类别。

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

TL;DR: UAV4D框架通过结合3D基础模型和人体网格重建模型，解决了无人机单目视频中动态场景和多移动行人重建的挑战，并在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态神经渲染方法未能充分解决无人机拍摄场景的独特挑战，如单目相机、俯视角和多移动行人，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 提出UAV4D框架，利用3D基础模型和人体网格重建模型重建场景和行人，通过行人-场景接触点解决尺度模糊问题，并利用SMPL模型和背景网格初始化高斯泼溅实现整体渲染。

Result: 在VisDrone、Manipal-UAV和Okutama-Action数据集上测试，PSNR提升1.5 dB，视觉清晰度更优。

Conclusion: UAV4D在无人机动态场景渲染中表现优异，为相关领域提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型物理标注系统，用于为自动光学检测生成训练数据，通过指针交互直接捕捉物理轨迹，提升标注效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统屏幕标注方法效率低且不够直观，无法充分利用人工检测经验。新系统旨在通过物理交互将专家知识直接转化为机器学习训练数据。

Method: 使用校准的追踪指针记录用户输入，并通过投影界面提供视觉引导，将空间交互转化为标准化标注格式。

Result: 初步评估证实系统能有效捕捉详细标注轨迹，并与CVAT集成优化后续ML任务工作流。

Conclusion: 该系统填补了人工经验与自动化数据生成间的鸿沟，为非IT专家参与ML训练提供了可能，未来有望推动自动光学检测的数据生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector提出了一种无需反转的视频编辑框架，通过ODE直接演化数据空间，保持时间一致性和结构细节，同时引入注意力掩码机制和增强编辑策略，实现局部可控编辑和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于反转的视频编辑方法导致的时间不一致和结构退化问题。

Method: 采用ODE直接演化数据空间，结合注意力掩码机制和增强编辑策略，实现局部可控编辑和语义对齐。

Result: 在指令遵循、时间一致性和背景保留方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlowDirector为高效且连贯的视频编辑提供了新范式，无需反转操作。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注数据集开发、模型优化和多模态方法整合，以推动越南DAR的进步。

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

Motivation: 提升图像编辑工具在指令遵循和内容保留方面的性能，同时优化数据管理和模型训练方法。

Method: 1. 改进数据管道，引入元信息嵌入策略；2. 提出联合学习流程，结合扩散损失和奖励损失。

Result: 在真实图像编辑测试中，SeedEdit 3.0 的可用性达到 56.1%，优于之前版本和其他工具。

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多模态街道评估框架（MSEF），结合视觉变换器和大型语言模型，用于评估街道景观的客观和主观感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的街道指标无法充分捕捉主观感知，而这对包容性城市设计至关重要。

Method: 研究使用视觉变换器（VisualGLM-6B）和大型语言模型（GPT-4），通过LoRA和P-Tuning v2进行参数高效调整，基于15,000张标注的街景图像进行微调。

Result: 模型在客观特征上F1得分为0.84，与居民感知的一致性达89.3%，并能捕捉上下文依赖的矛盾和非线性模式。

Conclusion: MSEF为城市感知建模提供了方法创新，并为规划系统提供了实用工具，以协调基础设施精确性与实际体验。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

TL;DR: ASTRAEA是一个自动框架，通过轻量级令牌选择和高效稀疏注意力策略，显著提升视频扩散变压器的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散变压器（vDiT）在文本到视频生成中表现出色，但高计算需求限制了实际部署。现有加速方法依赖启发式规则，适用性有限。

Method: ASTRAEA提出轻量级令牌选择机制和内存高效的GPU并行稀疏注意力策略，并结合进化算法自动优化令牌预算分配。

Result: 在单GPU上实现2.4倍推理加速（8GPU可达13.2倍），视频质量损失极小（VBench得分损失<0.5%）。

Conclusion: ASTRAEA显著提升了vDiT的推理效率，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在质量和一致性上取得进展，但牺牲了多样性，且现有评估方法依赖参考图像或缺乏针对性。

Method: 引入DIM-CIM框架，通过COCO-DIMCIM基准测试评估模型的默认模式多样性和泛化能力。

Result: 发现模型参数增加可能以牺牲默认模式多样性为代价提升泛化能力，并识别细粒度失败案例。

Conclusion: DIM-CIM为评估文本到图像模型提供了灵活且可解释的框架，有助于更全面理解模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测模型在非理想条件下性能不稳定，容易被绕过，因此需要更鲁棒的检测方法。

Method: 开发了PMM模型，使用Poisson混合、多样化掩码、生成器伪影和干扰物扩展伪造空间，并通过强退化训练提升检测器鲁棒性。

Result: 在DFDC和DFDCP数据集上分别实现了3.51%和6.21%的AUC提升。

Conclusion: PMM显著提升了检测器的鲁棒性和性能，解决了现有模型在非理想条件下的不足。

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Result: VLMs仅能识别有限基本属性，性能依赖对象位置，且关系理解能力不足，未达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解上仍有显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving

an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法多关注异常帧或对象，忽略了像素级分析，限制了检测范围。TAO旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 实验表明TAO在准确性和鲁棒性上达到新基准。

Conclusion: TAO通过统一框架实现了多粒度异常检测，为复杂视频序列中的异常定位提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and

TL;DR: TAPFM提出了一种单GPU任务适应方法，利用ViT注意力进行MIL聚合，优化特征表示和注意力权重，在临床任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应预训练的病理基础模型（PFMs）用于特定临床任务时面临挑战，主要由于WSI级标签的弱监督性和需要MIL范式。

Method: 采用ViT注意力进行MIL聚合，同时优化特征表示和注意力权重，保持MIL聚合器和PFM的独立计算图以实现稳定训练。

Result: 在膀胱癌和肺腺癌的突变预测任务中，TAPFM表现优于传统方法，并能有效处理多标签分类。

Conclusion: TAPFM使预训练PFM在标准硬件上的适应成为可能，适用于多种临床应用。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

*Yake Wei,Yu Miao,Dongzhan Zhou,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态低秩适应方法（MokA），针对当前高效多模态微调方法的局限性，强调单模态适应和跨模态适应的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效多模态微调方法多直接借鉴自LLMs，忽视了多模态场景的固有差异，导致无法充分利用所有模态。

Method: 提出MokA方法，通过模态特定参数压缩单模态信息，同时显式增强跨模态交互，实现单模态和跨模态的联合适应。

Result: 在多种多模态场景和LLM骨干网络上实验，均表现出一致性改进，验证了方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: MokA为多模态大模型的高效适应提供了更具针对性的解决方案，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Motivation: 解决在非视距条件下毫米波通信不可靠的问题，特别是在城市或基础设施有限的环境中。

Method: 利用单目摄像头检测ArUco标记，估计到达角，并通过电机控制金属板实时调整反射方向。

Result: 实验显示，系统在60GHz频段下平均接收信号强度提升了23dB，且信号接收概率达到0.89（阈值-65dB）。

Conclusion: 该系统在复杂动态环境中展现了强大的毫米波通信适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

Motivation: 理解神经网络在训练中的记忆行为对避免敏感信息泄露和提升知识密集型任务效果至关重要，尤其是多模态模型日益普及的背景下。

Result: 发现跨模态记忆存在显著差距，且在不同场景下普遍存在。

Conclusion: 提出基线方法缓解问题，希望促进更鲁棒的多模态学习技术发展。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

Motivation: 探究3D定位是否真正受益于检测任务，发现当前方法存在问题，从而提出改进方案。

Method: 提出DEGround框架，共享DETR查询用于检测和定位，并引入区域激活和查询调制模块。

Result: DEGround在EmbodiedScan验证集上比BIP3D模型提升了7.52%的准确率。

Conclusion: DEGround通过结合检测与定位任务，显著提升了3D定位性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

Motivation: 稀疏视图的3D场景重建对虚拟现实和具身AI等应用至关重要，但现有方法需要密集视图或难以处理视图锥外的区域。

Method: 提出OGGSplat，利用开放高斯的语义属性进行图像外推，结合RGB-语义一致性修复模块和双向扩散模型优化高斯参数。

Result: 建立了高斯外推（GO）基准测试，验证了方法在语义和生成质量上的优越性，并在智能手机拍摄的两视图图像上展示了语义感知重建能力。

Conclusion: OGGSplat在稀疏视图下实现了高效且语义一致的3D场景重建，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Result: 在提出的MotionBench基准测试中，Follow-Your-Motion表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Motion框架有效提升了视频运动迁移的效率和一致性，为领域提供了新的基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Conclusion: DSG-World为真实世界的3D重建和仿真提供了一种高效且一致的方法，无需依赖密集观测或多阶段处理。

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Motivation: 解决传统文档解析方法中复杂多工具流程和低效全页处理的不足。

Method: 采用SRR（结构-识别-关系）三元范式，将文档解析分解为三个基本问题，分别处理布局分析、内容识别和逻辑排序。

Result: 在MonkeyDoc数据集上表现优异，平均性能提升5.1%，处理速度更快（0.84页/秒），且3B参数模型超越更大模型。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR在文档解析任务中实现了高效、精确且可扩展的解决方案，适用于多语言和多类型文档。

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at

Result: 在五个公开数据集上，SAM-TTA优于现有TTA方法，甚至在某些场景下超越完全微调的模型如MedSAM。

Conclusion: SAM-TTA为通用医学图像分割提供了新范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

Conclusion: MoViX在无需环境特定调优的情况下，表现出优异的定位性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs偏好对齐技术（如DPO）在训练中可能导致目标和非目标响应的对数概率均下降，从而意外提升非目标响应的概率。

Method: 提出LeanPO方法，包括基于策略模型的平均似然重新定义奖励，以及动态标签平滑策略减少噪声影响。

Result: 实验表明LeanPO显著提升Video-LLMs性能，且额外训练开销小。

Conclusion: LeanPO为Video-LLMs提供了一种简单有效的偏好对齐方案，提升了模型的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

Motivation: 当前PAD系统因隐私保护限制，通常仅针对少数ID卡训练，导致在未知国家ID卡上表现不佳。FM因其大数据训练特性，有望提升泛化能力。

Method: 研究通过零样本和微调两种方式测试FM在PAD中的表现，使用了智利ID的私有数据集和芬兰、西班牙、斯洛伐克ID的开放数据集。

Result: 研究发现，真实图像（bona fide）是提升泛化能力的关键。

Conclusion: FM在PAD任务中具有潜力，尤其是通过真实图像优化泛化能力。

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TF-CoVR是一个专注于时间细粒度视频检索的新基准，通过使用LLM生成查询与修改文本对，并关联多个目标视频，提升了实用性。提出的TF-CoVR-Base框架通过预训练和对比学习显著提高了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoVR基准未能测试对快速、细微时间差异的捕捉能力，因此需要专门针对时间细粒度的新基准。

Method: 提出TF-CoVR基准，使用LLM生成查询与修改文本对，并关联多个目标视频；设计TF-CoVR-Base框架，包括预训练视频编码器和对比学习对齐。

Result: TF-CoVR-Base在零样本和微调模式下均显著提升性能，mAP@50分别从5.92提升至7.51和从19.83提升至25.82。

Conclusion: TF-CoVR填补了时间细粒度视频检索的空白，TF-CoVR-Base框架为相关任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多尺度双边网格方法，结合了外观编码和双边网格，显著提升了动态自动驾驶场景重建的几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以保证完美的光度一致性，现有方法（外观编码和双边网格）各有局限，无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出多尺度双边网格，统一外观编码和双边网格，优化像素级颜色映射。

Result: 在Waymo、NuScenes、Argoverse和PandaSet四个数据集上表现优异，几何精度显著提升，减少了光度不一致导致的漂浮物。

Conclusion: 多尺度双边网格方法在自动驾驶场景重建中表现出色，几何精度提升对障碍物避障和控制至关重要。

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在点云配准和形状组装中依赖对称标签和独立训练的问题，提出一种统一且自监督的方法。

Method: 通过条件生成模型学习点速度场，将噪声点移动到目标位置，并利用自监督编码器处理重叠点。

Result: 在六个基准测试中达到最新性能，统一框架支持联合训练，提升几何先验学习。

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow 提供了一种高效、统一的解决方案，显著提升了点云配准和形状组装的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型因时间上下文窗口有限，在场景重访时难以保持一致性，导致严重遗忘。受人类记忆机制启发，作者希望通过长时空间记忆提升模型性能。

Method: 引入了一种几何基础的长时空间记忆框架，包括信息存储和检索机制，并使用定制数据集训练和评估带有显式3D记忆机制的模型。

Result: 评估显示，相比基线模型，该方法在生成质量、一致性和上下文长度方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为长时一致的世界生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法缺乏3D一致性、计算成本高且难以捕捉锐利边界，RaySt3R旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用前馈Transformer预测查询射线的深度图、物体掩码和置信度分数，融合多视角预测完成3D形状重建。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，3D chamfer距离比基线提升44%。

Conclusion: RaySt3R通过新视角合成方法显著提升了3D形状补全的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出Vision Concept Transformer (VCT)和Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)，解决医学领域可解释AI中概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)的性能和稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域对透明度的需求促使研究可解释AI。现有CBMs仅依赖概念特征，忽略了医学图像的内在特征，且性能和稳定性不足。

Method: VCT结合概念特征与图像特征；SVCT基于VCT，采用Vision Transformer (ViT)和Denoised Diffusion Smoothing提升稳定性和解释性。

Result: 在四个医学数据集上，VCT和SVCT在保持准确性的同时提供可解释性；SVCT在扰动下仍能提供稳定解释。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT满足医学领域对可解释性和稳定性的需求，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要关注静态场景，忽视了用户交互带来的动态变化，因此需要一个新的基准来评估动态环境中的物体认知能力。

Method: 提出了EOC-Bench，包含3,277个标注的QA对，分为过去、现在和未来三类，覆盖11个评估维度和3种视觉物体引用类型。采用混合格式的人工标注框架和多尺度时间精度指标。

Result: 基于EOC-Bench对多种MLLMs进行了全面评估，证明了其作为评估工具的有效性。

Conclusion: EOC-Bench为提升MLLMs的物体认知能力提供了关键工具，并为开发可靠的嵌入式系统核心模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

Motivation: 现有图像分词器在压缩过程中编码的双向依赖关系阻碍了自回归模型的有效建模。

Method: 使用因果解码器建立单向依赖关系，结合前缀标记和两阶段分词器训练，增强重建一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet-256基准测试中，AliTok在177M参数下gFID为1.50，IS为305.9；662M参数时gFID为1.35，超越现有扩散方法且采样速度快10倍。

Conclusion: AliTok在图像生成中表现出色，兼具高效重建和生成友好性。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在视频修复中表现出色，但其计算成本高昂，且现有方法难以扩展到高分辨率视频。SeedVR2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出动态调整窗口大小的注意力机制，并引入多种损失函数（包括特征匹配损失）以稳定对抗训练。

Result: 实验表明，SeedVR2在单步修复中性能优于或接近现有方法。

Conclusion: SeedVR2为高效高质量的视频修复提供了可行方案，尤其在处理高分辨率视频时表现突出。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在区域级视觉理解任务中的效率和多模态输出不足的问题。

Method: 通过Semantic Perceiver将SAM 2的视觉特征转化为多模态token供LLMs处理，并开发了数据增强流程。

Result: PAM在速度和内存消耗上优于现有方法（快1.2-2.4倍），并在多任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PAM为区域级视觉理解提供了高效且实用的解决方案，可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

Result: 在SPair-71k上实现了超过4%的绝对性能提升，相比类似监督要求的方法提升超过7%。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，易于扩展到其他数据源，显著提升了语义对应估计的性能。

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

Conclusion: ProJo4D为物理基础的4D场景理解提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

Motivation: 研究3D VLMs性能不如2D VLMs的原因，探索如何提升3D场景理解能力。

Method: 分类3D VLMs为3D对象中心、2D图像基础和3D场景中心方法，分析其性能差异及原因。

Result: 发现3D场景中心模型依赖3D编码器不足，预训练效果差，且易过度依赖语言线索。

Conclusion: 提出新数据集以改进3D理解，强调需优化评估和策略以提升3D VLMs性能。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PM-Loss的新型正则化损失，用于解决深度图中物体边界处的深度不连续性问题，从而提升3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度图在3DGS中常用于生成3D点云，但物体边界处的深度不连续性会导致点云稀疏或碎片化，影响渲染质量。

Method: 通过预训练的transformer预测点图（pointmap），并设计PM-Loss作为正则化损失，强制几何平滑性。

Result: 改进后的深度图显著提升了3DGS的渲染效果，适用于多种架构和场景。

Conclusion: PM-Loss有效解决了深度不连续性问题，提升了3DGS的渲染质量。

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出了CG-AV-Counting基准和AV-Reasoner模型，用于解决视频理解中的计数任务问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在计数任务上表现不佳，现有基准存在视频短、查询封闭、缺乏线索标注和多模态覆盖不足等问题。

Method: 提出CG-AV-Counting基准，包含1,027个多模态问题和5,845个标注线索；设计AV-Reasoner模型，采用GRPO和课程学习提升计数能力。

Result: AV-Reasoner在多个基准上达到最优性能，但语言空间推理在域外基准上无效。

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting是一个全面的计数测试平台，AV-Reasoner展示了强化学习的有效性，但需进一步改进域外性能。

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However,
experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language
space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been
realeased on https://av-reasoner.github.io.

TL;DR: MINT-CoT提出了一种通过动态插入视觉令牌来增强多模态数学推理的方法，显著提升了模型在数学视觉任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将Chain-of-Thought扩展到多模态领域时存在局限性，如依赖粗粒度图像区域、视觉编码器对数学内容感知有限等。

Method: MINT-CoT通过Interleave Token动态选择数学图形中的视觉区域，并构建了包含54K数学问题的数据集，采用三阶段训练策略。

Result: MINT-CoT-7B在多个数据集上显著优于基线模型，如MathVista（+34.08%）、GeoQA（+28.78%）和MMStar（+23.2%）。

Conclusion: MINT-CoT为多模态数学推理提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

TL;DR: VideoMarathon是一个大规模的长视频指令跟随数据集，包含约9,700小时的长视频和3.3M高质量QA对，支持22种任务。基于此，Hour-LLaVA模型通过内存增强模块实现了小时级视频训练和推理，并在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频标注数据稀缺，限制了小时级视频大模型（Video-LMMs）的训练。

Method: 提出VideoMarathon数据集，包含长视频和多样化QA对；开发Hour-LLaVA模型，利用内存增强模块实现高效训练和推理。

Result: Hour-LLaVA在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现最佳，验证了数据集和模型的有效性。

Conclusion: VideoMarathon填补了长视频数据空白，Hour-LLaVA为长视频语言建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频定位方法缺乏语言模型的推理能力，限制了上下文理解和泛化能力。

Method: 结合Molmo架构和时序模块，采用注意力机制和双向点传播技术，分两步生成定位坐标和分割掩码。

Result: 在多个任务和基准测试中显著提升了时空定位准确性和推理能力。

Conclusion: VideoMolmo为时空定位任务提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了一种从室内空间的多视角全景图像和纹理网格中生成无家具副本的流程，通过简化网格、边缘提取和ControlNet修复技术，生成高质量的无家具场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如神经辐射场或RGB-D修复）在生成无家具场景时存在模糊或幻觉问题，需要一种更高质量的方法。

Method: 1. 从网格中分割并移除家具，生成简化网格（SDM）；2. 从SDM提取深度和法线图像的Canny边缘；3. 使用ControlNet修复全景图像；4. 用修复后的图像重新纹理化网格。

Result: 该方法生成的资产质量高于依赖神经辐射场或RGB-D修复的方法，避免了模糊和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 提出的流程能有效生成高质量的无家具场景，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

TL;DR: DirectLayout是一个基于大语言模型的框架，通过三阶段生成3D室内场景布局，解决了现有方法在开放词汇和细粒度指令对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D室内场景合成的布局生成因数据集有限而具有挑战性，现有方法要么过拟合，要么牺牲灵活性。DirectLayout旨在生成开放词汇且符合用户指令的场景。

Method: DirectLayout分三阶段生成布局：鸟瞰图（BEV）生成、3D空间提升和对象放置优化，利用Chain-of-Thought激活和生成布局奖励增强空间推理。

Result: 实验表明，DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化能力和物理合理性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DirectLayout通过直接生成数值3D布局，显著提升了场景合成的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Method: 提出RAS框架，结合掩码中心的大型多模态模型，支持复杂多模态交互和理解。

Result: RAS在ORES任务及经典RES和GRES任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ORES任务和RAS框架为多模态交互下的图像分割提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

Motivation: 探索MLLMs如何处理视觉输入，揭示注意力机制中的稀疏性现象，以优化模型效率。

Method: 通过分析注意力机制识别视觉头，设计训练无关的框架量化视觉相关性，并开发KV-Cache优化策略SparseMM。

Result: SparseMM在主流多模态基准测试中实现了1.38倍实时加速和52%内存减少，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 视觉头的稀疏性为MLLMs的效率优化提供了新思路，SparseMM展示了显著的性能提升和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS通过灵活的4D表示和运动函数，有效提升了动态3D场景的建模能力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

Result: 基准测试揭示了现有模型的局限性，并提供了细粒度的模型能力诊断工具。

Conclusion: VideoMathQA为多模态数学推理模型提供了系统评估框架，推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为对比流匹配（Contrastive Flow Matching）的方法，用于增强条件扩散模型中流的唯一性，从而提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在条件设置下（如类别条件模型），流匹配的唯一性无法保证，导致生成结果模糊。

Method: 通过引入对比目标，最大化不同条件流之间的差异，增强条件分离。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在训练速度、去噪步骤和FID指标上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 对比流匹配是一种有效的改进方法，显著提升了条件扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code
at: https://github.com/gstoica27/DeltaFM.git.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

Method: 结合MLNs，通过加权逻辑约束对输入分配概率，提升OOD检测器的性能。同时提出一种学习逻辑约束的算法。

Result: 实验表明，MLNs能显著提升多种OOD检测器的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MLNs为OOD检测提供了性能提升和可解释性的双重优势。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型三重注意力Transformer架构，用于预测时间依赖性混凝土徐变，通过自注意力机制捕捉历史徐变模式的长程依赖关系，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅将时间作为输入参数而未建模变形发展序列性的问题。

Method: 将混凝土徐变预测转化为自回归序列建模任务，采用三重注意力框架（时间、特征和批次注意力）。

Result: 在160天的标准化数据集上，平均绝对百分比误差为1.63%，R2值为0.999，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 证明了Transformer架构在材料科学问题中的可行性，为结构行为预测和工程设计提供了数据驱动的新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Conclusion: SafeSteer是一种简单有效的方法，为LLM的安全调整提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Result: 实验表明MUC-G4能高效处理量化和剪枝，验证时间显著缩短且证明重用率高。

Conclusion: MUC-G4为压缩神经网络的安全性和可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Conclusion: PANN为星上数据处理提供了一种高效、低资源需求的解决方案，特别适用于自然灾害监测。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

Conclusion: 预训练任务的结构性可以促进模型发展出支持上下文关系推理的表征能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ算法在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，为物联网优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM聊天机器人交互中，如何在提取有用信息的同时严格保护用户隐私是一个关键挑战。

Method: 采用差分隐私工具（如聚类、分区选择和直方图摘要）和多种关键词提取方法（频率、TF-IDF和LLM引导）。

Result: 评估显示框架在保留语义内容和用户隐私方面表现优异，优于非隐私保护的基线方法。

Conclusion: Urania框架成功实现了隐私保护与数据效用的平衡，为LLM交互分析提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可再生能源转型中，电网稳定性依赖于精准的电力需求预测。现有方法对不同消费者群体的需求模式差异考虑不足，因此需要定制化预测策略。

Method: 通过消费者聚类区分工业、商业和居民用户，为每类用户选择包括时间、社会经济和天气数据在内的特征，并比较多种AI和机器学习算法的预测效果。

Conclusion: 定制化预测策略和详细天气数据的结合显著提升了预测准确性，有助于电网稳定性。

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth
Observation (EO) program. A variety of AI and machine learning algorithms for
Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby
supporting grid stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合真实数据和合成数据的深度学习框架，用于短期预测露天矿运输车队容量，以减少不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 露天矿运营中天气波动、机械故障和人员变动等因素导致运输车队容量预测困难，需要更精准的预测方法。

Method: 采用深度学习框架，结合高分辨率降雨数据、车队性能遥测数据和合成机械故障场景，评估了XGBoost回归器和LSTM网络。

Result: XGBoost回归器的中位数绝对误差为14.3%，LSTM为15.1%；SHAP分析显示累积降雨、历史负载趋势和模拟故障频率是关键预测因素。

Conclusion: 混合建模方法为动态不确定条件下的车队管理提供了全面的决策支持工具，未来将进一步整合维护计划和人力资源数据以提升预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集成学习系统中一致性和可靠性的问题，特别是在复杂问题中提升性能。

Method: 1. 解剖学过程：选择多样化的典型元素构建目标集成模型；2. 生理学过程：通过softlog-softmax层实现中间决策一致性；3. 信息理论过程：提出基于softlog的熵和散度构建信息度量；4. 性能评估过程：推导信息性性能张量。

Result: 研究表明，问题越复杂，集成多样性越有用；提出的方法能有效提升系统的一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过4步方法，softlog-softmax级联显著提升了集成学习系统的性能，尤其在复杂问题中表现突出。

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Result: 通过广泛的消融研究，分析了LoRA、KL散度和拉格朗日乘数等关键组件对RFT性能的影响。

Conclusion: RedRFT有助于全面理解RFT红队测试的实现细节，并支持快速原型开发。

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

TL;DR: YOTO方法通过一次性训练自动优化损失权重超参数，避免多次训练，并在计算机视觉任务中表现优于网格搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要多次训练以优化损失权重，YOTO旨在通过一次性训练解决这一问题。

Method: 将损失权重作为网络参数，通过梯度优化和软最大层自动学习，并引入正则化损失确保权重均匀性和有界性。

Result: YOTO在3D估计和语义分割任务中表现优于网格搜索方法。

Conclusion: YOTO提供了一种高效的一次性训练方法，显著减少了优化损失权重的复杂性。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

Method: 设计“半”单元，固定部分权重随机，仅调整两个权重，适用于任何层。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上验证了方法的有效性，减少了参数数量。

Conclusion: 半隐藏层单元通过随机连接的正则化效果，实现了参数效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in

terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor
ratio
  Unlike single metric objectives for example the Sharpe ratio our formulation
is modular and parameterized by weights w1 w2 w3 and w4 enabling practitioners

  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Conclusion: 样本回放的效果依赖于回放样本的选择和任务间关系，需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

Motivation: 在基于价值的强化学习中，移除目标网络虽然可以节省内存并利用最新估计，但会导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出iS-QL方法，共享在线网络的最后线性层作为目标网络，结合并行学习Bellman迭代的思想。

Result: iS-QL在多种设置下提高了目标无关方法的样本效率，且内存占用更小，训练时间与传统目标方法相当。

Conclusion: iS-QL为强化学习研究提供了一种高效且可扩展的新方法。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Conclusion: UMCNP在样本效率和适应性方面优于现有方法，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Result: 研究发现，CL与NSCL损失之间的差距随着类别数量的增加而消失，且NSCL损失的全局极小值具有特定的几何结构。少样本误差界限依赖于特征变异性的两个度量，并表明方向性变异对界限的影响更大。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论和实验验证，揭示了自监督对比学习的理论基础，并表明CL隐式优化了NSCL损失。此外，提出的少样本误差界限为实际应用提供了性能估计。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Conclusion: 零阶优化方法为资源受限的LLM微调提供了实用且理论可靠的新途径。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

*Zixuan Xia,Aram Davtyan,Paolo Favaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KOALA++是一种基于卡尔曼滤波的优化算法，通过显式建模梯度不确定性提升神经网络训练效率，优于传统二阶方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二阶优化方法计算成本高，KOALA++旨在通过更高效的方式捕捉梯度不确定性结构。

Method: 通过递归更新紧凑的梯度协方差乘积，直接估计参数协方差矩阵，避免存储完整协方差矩阵和大矩阵求逆。

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模等任务中，KOALA++的准确性与最先进的一阶和二阶优化器相当或更好，同时保持一阶方法的效率。

Conclusion: KOALA++在性能和效率之间取得了平衡，为神经网络训练提供了一种更优的优化方法。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

*Hari K. Prakash,Charles H. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络中的grokking现象，发现了一种新的第三阶段——anti-grokking，并利用HTSR指标α成功区分了所有三个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络训练中的grokking现象，特别是其潜在的第三阶段anti-grokking，以更好地理解模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST子集上训练，结合WeightWatcher工具分析HTSR指标α和其他竞争性指标。

Result: 发现anti-grokking阶段，HTSR指标α能区分所有三个阶段，而其他指标仅能检测前两个阶段。

Conclusion: HTSR指标α是衡量泛化能力的有效工具，其目标值α≈2可作为层收敛的通用标准。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有机化学中合成目标分子的反应路径预测是一个组合性问题，现有方法在单步逆合成中难以生成准确且多样的反应集。

Method: RSF框架通过马尔可夫桥连接目标分子和反应物分子，结合反应中心识别生成中间结构（synthons），并利用Feynman-Kac引导和顺序蒙特卡洛重采样优化生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，RSF在top-1准确率上达到60.0%，优于之前方法20%；FK引导进一步将top-5往返准确率提升19%。

Conclusion: RSF框架显著提升了单步逆合成的准确性和多样性，同时保持了竞争力强的top-k准确率。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

Motivation: 在机器学习中，某些区域的预测准确性比其他区域更重要，但传统损失函数无法区分重要性差异。

Method: 设计了基于Sigmoid和双曲正弦链接的选择性标量损失函数，并扩展到多维选择性损失框架，利用复合Softmax函数解决多类问题。

Result: 选择性损失函数在高重要性区域预测中表现优于传统损失函数，适用于多种应用场景。

Conclusion: 选择性损失函数能够有效解决预测区域重要性差异问题，并在多个任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

TL;DR: 本文扩展了ODXU框架，结合神经符号AI和不确定性量化方法，提升网络入侵检测系统的性能，并通过迁移学习验证其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络入侵检测系统在面对复杂威胁时的鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 扩展ODXU框架，整合深度嵌入聚类、符号推理（XGBoost）和不确定性量化方法（如SHAP值、信息增益），并开发迁移学习策略。

Result: 在CIC-IDS-2017数据集上，ODXU在六项指标上优于传统神经网络模型；迁移学习在ACI-IoT-2023数据集上表现优异，仅需50%训练数据即可超越传统方法。

Conclusion: ODXU框架显著提升了网络入侵检测的性能和泛化能力，不确定性量化方法和迁移学习策略为网络安全领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了系统性（systematicity）在机器学习模型中的重要性，区分了行为系统性与表征系统性，并分析了现有基准测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统性是组合性的核心，能提升模型在新场景中的泛化能力。现有研究多关注行为系统性，而忽略了表征系统性，论文旨在强调这一区别。

Method: 基于Hadley（1994）的分类法，分析了语言和视觉领域的关键基准测试对行为系统性的评估程度。

Result: 发现现有基准测试主要测试行为系统性，未充分考察表征系统性。

Conclusion: 提出应通过机制可解释性领域的方法评估表征系统性，以更全面地理解模型的系统性能力。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器学习在牙科服务提供者分类中的应用，以优化资源分配，尤其是针对服务不足人群。

Method: 使用2018年数据集（24,300实例，20特征），采用信息增益、基尼指数和ANOVA进行特征排名，评估12种机器学习模型（如kNN、决策树、SVM等）的准确性。

Result: 神经网络模型表现最佳（94.1%准确率），特征排名显示治疗服务计数是关键预测因素，而人口统计变量影响较小。

Conclusion: 特征选择对模型性能至关重要，结合特征排名和高级算法可优化分类，支持资源精准分配。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的情况下，如何最优选择LLM及其适应策略是一个挑战，需要避免昂贵的实验。

Method: 提出COSMOS框架，结合嵌入增强的轻量级代理模型和低样本扩展法则，预测微调性能和检索增强的上下文学习效果。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COSMOS平均减少92.72%的计算成本，最高可达98.71%，同时保持高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 高效预测LLM适应结果是可行的，能显著降低计算开销，同时保持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

TL;DR: 正交化梯度训练（⊥Grad）在不牺牲准确性的情况下提升模型校准性，适用于多种场景且优化器无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在训练过程中通过正交化梯度改进模型校准性，同时保持模型准确性。

Method: 提出⊥Grad方法，通过正交化梯度优化模型训练，适用于不同优化器和后处理校准技术。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等数据集上，⊥Grad与SGD准确性相当，但校准性显著提升，且在输入损坏和长时间训练下表现更稳健。

Conclusion: ⊥Grad是一种高效且通用的方法，能够提升模型校准性，理论分析也支持其收敛性和优化特性。

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Result: 在模拟和实验硬件上验证了PGT的性能，达到与标准反向传播相当的效果。

Conclusion: PGT为物理储层与深度神经网络结合提供了可能，有望显著提升AI训练的能效。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Conclusion: 多尺度隐式神经模拟器有效解决了长期预测的稳定性和物理一致性问题。

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型训练中跨区域通信成本高和异构硬件利用率不均的问题。

Method: 提出HALoS框架，结合本地参数服务器（LPS）和全局参数服务器（GPS），利用分层动量和异步训练减少通信开销。

Result: HALoS在跨区域训练中比同步基线快7.5倍，比现有异步方法快2.1倍，同时保持或超过同步SGD的模型质量。

Conclusion: 分层异步优化是高效、可扩展训练新时代LLMs的强大工具。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

Result: NOBLE在真实实验数据上验证，实现了4200倍的加速，并生成具有试验间变异性的合成神经元。

Conclusion: NOBLE为理解神经元组成、计算及神经AI应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Method: 提出Neural MJD模型，结合时间非齐次Itô扩散与复合泊松过程，引入截断似然机制和Euler-Maruyama重启求解器。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，Neural MJD优于当前最优的深度学习和统计学习方法。

Conclusion: Neural MJD通过显式建模随机过程，有效提升了非平稳时间序列预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型驱动的量子联邦学习算法（mdQFL），解决了大规模数据集、多设备参与和非独立同分布数据分布的挑战，显著降低了通信成本并提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在大规模数据集和多设备参与时面临瓶颈，且数据异构性影响系统性能。本文旨在解决这些问题，特别是在量子联邦学习（QFL）背景下。

Method: 引入模型驱动的量子联邦学习算法（mdQFL），支持训练和更新个性化，并测试泛化能力。通过Qiskit环境下的实验验证其效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，mdQFL减少了50%的通信成本，同时保持或提升了模型准确性，并改善了本地模型训练效果。

Conclusion: mdQFL在量子联邦学习中表现出色，为解决通信成本和数据异构性问题提供了有效方案，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的差分隐私语言模型推理方法，通过聚类输入数据并利用中位数聚合令牌预测，提高了生成文本的质量和隐私保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过均匀随机采样敏感输入生成差分隐私文本，但在处理异质主题时效果不佳。

Method: 通过聚类输入数据选择推理批次，并利用中位数而非平均值聚合令牌预测，以减少局部敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在代表性和下游任务性能上优于现有方法，且隐私成本更低。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了差分隐私语言模型生成文本的质量和效率。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Conclusion: 结论指出扩展定律的准确推导为模型和数据集的跨尺度比较提供了有效手段，推动了开放基础模型的系统改进。

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Motivation: 在关键领域中，GNN的解释可靠性对人类决策至关重要，但对称化操作会丢失方向信息，导致误导性解释。

Method: 通过理论和实证研究，分析对称化操作对解释质量的影响，并提出保留方向语义的方法。

Result: 保留方向语义显著提高了GNN的解释质量，为决策者提供更可靠的见解。

Conclusion: 方向感知的GNN可解释性在安全关键应用中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过双向边界（同时最大化下界和最小化上界）训练能量模型（EBM）的方法，以解决传统训练中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能量模型（EBMs）虽然能优雅地估计未归一化密度，但训练困难。传统方法通过极小化下界训练，但会导致不稳定性。

Method: 提出使用双向边界（最大化下界和最小化上界）训练EBM，研究了四种不同的对数似然边界，并提供了评估算法。

Result: 双向边界方法稳定了EBM训练，实现了高质量的密度估计和样本生成。

Conclusion: 双向边界方法有效解决了EBM训练中的不稳定性问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Conclusion: 澄清了关于过度平滑的误解，揭示了深层GNN的潜力。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了PML中的高维问题，提高了正标签的识别能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据非独立同分布和多模态问题导致单一模型不适用，部分个性化模型可能加剧客户端漂移，影响算法效果。

Method: 提出FedAPM框架，结合ADMM方法，通过一阶和二阶近端项构建增广拉格朗日函数，实现本地与共享模型的补偿和固定校正。

Result: FedAPM在收敛稳定性、效率和准确性上优于现有方法，平均提升12.3%测试准确率、16.4% F1分数和18.0% AUC，且通信轮次更少。

Conclusion: FedAPM通过显式估计拉格朗日乘子，有效缓解客户端漂移，实现全局收敛，适用于异构和多模态数据场景。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Method: 在两个大型零售数据集（M5和VN1）上评估了十种基础模型和八种集成配置，考虑了不同重训练频率下的点预测和概率预测精度。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计集成策略和选择重训练频率，可以实现高精度、鲁棒且成本效益高的预测，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in

TL;DR: DIPNet通过将输入投影到可学习的分布中，平滑损失景观，提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过参数化模型下训练损失对泛化性能的指导有限，平滑性虽与泛化相关，但直接实现困难。

Method: 提出DIPNet框架，将输入逐层投影到可学习分布中，诱导更平滑的损失景观。

Result: 理论分析显示DIPNet降低局部平滑度与Lipschitz常数，实验验证其在多种模型和任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: DIPNet是一种通用且有效的方法，可无缝集成到现有模型中，提升深度学习泛化性能。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解边对GNN行为的影响对提高其可解释性和鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法依赖严格凸性假设且仅考虑边删除。

Method: 提出了一种近端Bregman响应函数，放宽凸性要求，并显式考虑消息传播效应，支持边删除和插入的影响预测。

Result: 实验证明该方法能准确预测GNNs中边操作的影响，并在图重连和对抗攻击等应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNNs的影响预测提供了更灵活和准确的工具，适用于多种实际应用。

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升模型能力上表现显著，但其改善推理能力的机制尚不明确，因此需要系统性研究。

Method: 提出RLVR方法，通过实验和理论分析研究其优化推理模式选择的效果，并探讨梯度流和收敛动态。

Conclusion: RLVR的理论和实验结果为理解强化学习在LLM微调中的作用提供了新见解，并为提升推理能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卫星数据和机器学习的框架，用于分类孟加拉国38个地区的干旱情况，弥补了传统干旱指数的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国因其独特的地理和人为脆弱性，干旱对农业和社会经济稳定造成严重影响。传统干旱指数（如SPI和PDSI）未充分考虑土壤湿度和温度等因素，且机器学习模型在该地区的应用不足。

Method: 采用无监督算法（如K-means和贝叶斯高斯混合）进行聚类，随后使用KNN、随机森林、决策树和朴素贝叶斯等分类模型，整合2012-2024年的天气数据（湿度、土壤湿度、温度）。

Result: 框架成功将干旱严重程度分类为不同级别，但发现各地区干旱脆弱性存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在识别和预测干旱条件方面表现出潜力，但仍需进一步优化以应对区域差异性。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

Result: 双ISL在实验中表现优于传统方法，收敛更快、训练更稳定，且能有效防止模式坍塌。

Conclusion: 双ISL是一种高效且理论完备的隐式生成模型训练方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA数据集上，算法比传统方法（如梯度手术）快几个数量级。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能高效实现数据遗忘，同时保持模型生成质量，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升LLM推理能力时因缺乏中间监督导致探索效率低，单一错误可能破坏整个推理链，影响训练稳定性。

Method: MGRPO采用双层GRPO：第一层生成初始答案，第二层针对初始答案进行错误修正，形成自我纠正循环。

Result: 实验表明，MGRPO在数学推理任务中显著优于标准GRPO，提升了推理和自我纠正能力。

Conclusion: MGRPO通过双层机制有效解决了GRPO的探索效率问题，提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Method: 提出了对数线性注意力机制，用对数增长的隐藏状态集替代固定大小的隐藏状态，并展示了其并行计算的可行性。

Result: 实验表明，对数线性注意力在Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet等架构上表现良好，优于线性时间变体。

Conclusion: 对数线性注意力是一种通用框架，能够高效地结合线性注意力和softmax注意力的优势。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

### [257] [Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775)
*Artin Tajdini,Jonathan Scarlett,Kevin Jamieson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

Conclusion: 研究为VQ中QUBO公式的权重参数提供了新的几何解释。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

Conclusion: Adam的自适应预条件器设计是损失突增的根本原因，为优化器改进提供了新方向。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: 逻辑谜题训练重塑了LLMs的内部推理机制，实现了更稳健的组合泛化，而无需依赖任务特定的符号工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a

EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

TL;DR: 对比损失在多模态表示学习中广泛使用，但难以学习对齐的表示空间。本文认为这是由于表示空间中存在模态特定信息，并提出一种正则化损失函数以提升对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比损失无法有效去除模态特定信息，导致表示空间对齐效果不佳。

Method: 通过信息瓶颈原理分析问题，提出基于变分近似的正则化损失函数。

Result: 在控制实验和实际应用中验证了正则化项的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法能显著提升多模态表示的对齐效果。

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过引入信息瓶颈（IB）目标，确保每个表示组件仅保留与其对应概念相关的信息，从而提升模型的解释性和干预有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽然能预测预定义概念，但无法保证表示组件仅编码该概念信息，这影响了模型的解释性和干预效果。

Method: 提出最小概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过添加变分正则化项实现信息瓶颈目标，约束表示组件仅保留与概念相关的信息。

Result: MCBMs支持具有理论保证的概念级干预，符合贝叶斯原则，并在设计选择上更具灵活性。

Conclusion: MCBMs通过信息瓶颈目标解决了CBMs的局限性，显著提升了模型的解释性和干预能力。

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于CT扫描的半自动化分类方法（GPDSSM），用于髋关节发育不良的诊断，相比传统角度测量方法，其分类准确率更高（AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%），并能节省临床医生的时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 髋关节发育不良是骨关节炎的风险因素，早期诊断有助于手术干预。传统方法依赖手动测量和2D扫描，效率低且准确性有限。

Method: 结合高斯过程隐变量模型和微分同胚，开发了GPDSSM统计形状模型，利用192例CT扫描（100训练，92测试）进行分类。

Result: GPDSSM能有效区分发育不良样本，并识别异常区域，AUC达96.2%，优于传统方法（91.2%）。

Conclusion: GPDSSM提高了诊断准确性和效率，为临床提供了更优的工具。

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: 早期识别ICU高危患者对医疗资源分配至关重要，但现有方法在性能和实用性上存在不足。

Method: ALFIA结合LoRA适配器和自适应层加权机制，从BERT主干中融合多层语义特征，并在cw-24基准上训练。

Result: ALFIA在AUPRC上超越现有表格分类器，其嵌入特征还能与GBDT和深度神经网络结合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: ALFIA为临床提供了一种基于常规文本的便捷且强大的风险分层工具，适用于重症监护环境。

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

Motivation: 工业4.0引入的复杂性需要简化，同时支持工业5.0的人本、可持续和韧性原则，通过Agentic AI与意图范式结合实现。

Method: 提出框架，将自然语言表达的意图分解为可执行组件，由子代理执行任务，使用CMAPSS数据集和Google ADK验证。

Result: 实验证明框架可行，能降低技术障碍并支持可扩展的意图驱动自动化，但数据质量和可解释性仍需改进。

Conclusion: 该框架为工业自动化提供了新方向，但需进一步解决数据质量和可解释性问题。

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTQuant提出四种轻量级函数保持变换（FPTs）以优化大语言模型（LLMs）的量化，减少计算和能源消耗，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理时计算和能源消耗巨大，传统量化方法因大范围异常值导致性能显著下降。

Method: 引入四种FPTs：预RoPE变换、值变换、MLP块内缩放变换和动态缩放变换，利用变换器的固有特性保持模型功能并优化激活分布。

Result: FPTQuant实现静态INT4量化，速度提升3.9倍，精度与多数现有方法相当或更优，仅略低于一种慢29%的方法。

Conclusion: FPTQuant在保持模型功能的同时显著提升效率，是LLM量化的先进解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究（如OMWU）已证明自适应学习步调在无遗憾学习中的有效性，但这种现象是否孤立尚不明确。本文旨在证明其普适性，并提出更高效的框架。

Method: 基于FTRL框架，通过自适应步调调整（Cautious Optimism），以最小计算开销实现加速学习。

Result: 在自对弈中实现接近最优的$O_T(\log T)$遗憾，同时在对抗场景中保持$O(\sqrt{T})$最优遗憾。

Conclusion: 本文展示了无需单调步长假设的快速学习新途径，为一般博弈中的高效学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

Conclusion: CREAM通过结构化和正则化设计，实现了概念与任务的高效结合，为可解释模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

Result: MPP编码具有形状中心性和连续性，能区分空间对象的几何特征，并高精度捕捉空间关系，性能优于栅格化方法。

Conclusion: MPP编码是一种通用且高效的矢量地理空间数据编码方法，适用于多种机器学习任务。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Result: 基础模型显著提升性能，方法间表现相似，但对模型选择和适应策略敏感。

Conclusion: PartialCLIP有效，但需进一步优化基础模型选择和适应策略。

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

Result: TIMING在合成和真实时间序列基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TIMING结合时间感知和理论优势，显著提升时间序列XAI效果。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

Method: iN2V结合了后处理步骤（计算新节点嵌入）和训练过程的优化（使嵌入适应后处理）。该方法可与其他嵌入方法结合使用。

Result: 实验显示，iN2V平均提升节点分类性能1个百分点，最高可达6个百分点，具体取决于数据集和未见节点的数量。

Conclusion: iN2V是一种灵活且有效的方法，可将转导式嵌入扩展到归纳式场景，并提升节点分类性能。代码已开源。

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

Motivation: 在动态环境中，数据分布会随时间变化，但并非所有变化都会导致模型性能下降，因此需要一种无需标签的方法来判断何时重新训练模型。

Method: 基于预测模型的分歧设计D3M算法，能够在非退化性变化下保持低误报率，并在退化性变化下实现高真报率。

Conclusion: D3M是一种实用且高效的监控算法，能够有效检测模型性能退化，适用于动态环境中的模型维护。

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: NIMO成功结合了神经网络和线性模型的优点，既提高了性能，又保持了线性系数的可解释性。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

*Marten Lienen,Abdullah Saydemir,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文扩展了HiPPO框架，提出了一种考虑测量噪声的状态空间模型初始化方法，提升了模型对噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO框架假设数据无噪声，但实际数据常含噪声，因此需要一种能处理噪声的初始化方法。

Method: 将HiPPO重新解释为线性随机控制问题，数据作为噪声输出，推导出新的动态初始化方法，推断潜在系统的后验分布。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在训练和推理时均提升了模型对噪声的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性感知初始化方法有效解决了HiPPO在噪声数据中的局限性。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于核化KL散度估计器的半隐式变分推断方法，通过非参数平滑和重要性采样校正降低训练偏差和方差，优化效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半隐式变分推断方法（如KSIVI）在高维场景下训练成本高且存在偏差和方差问题，需改进。

Method: 提出核化KL散度估计器，结合非参数平滑和重要性采样校正，降低偏差和方差。

Result: 理论证明与Stein变分梯度下降目标一致，但梯度方差更低；实验显示性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在训练效率和性能上优于现有半隐式变分推断方法，具有更稳定的优化效果。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Method: 使用线性回归框架，分析种子控制和随机输入对合成数据隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 发现种子控制下隐私泄露严重，而随机输入下隐私保护效果优于模型本身。

Conclusion: 线性回归的研究为未来更广泛的隐私保护边界提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

have emerged to tackle user privacy concerns and efficiency in embedded
systems. Even more recently, an efficient federated anomaly detection
algorithm, FLiForest, based on Isolation Forests has been developed, offering a
low-resource, unsupervised method well-suited for edge deployment and
continuous learning. In this paper, we present an application of Isolation
Forest-based temperature anomaly detection, developed using the previously

systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated,
achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and
above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations,
while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and
edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and

Motivation: 探索生成扩散模型与联想记忆模型的联系，揭示其通用性质及噪声水平变化对生成与记忆转换的影响。

Method: 利用Morse-Smale动力系统分析梯度联想记忆模型和扩散模型，研究其在零噪声极限下的稳定性。

Result: 发现联想记忆学习景观和扩散模型在零噪声极限下具有稳定性，仅在某些孤立点存在例外，并通过分岔序列描述景观特征。

Conclusion: 通过分岔序列和结构稳定性准则，为经典和现代Hopfield网络（即注意力机制）提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TreeRPO的新方法，通过树采样估计推理步骤中的奖励期望，解决了现有方法在中间步骤奖励不足的问题，显著提升了LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于轨迹级奖励的方法无法为推理的中间步骤提供足够指导，限制了LLM的优化效果。

Method: TreeRPO通过树采样直接估计步骤级奖励，并基于GRPO的组相对奖励机制计算细粒度奖励信号。

Result: 实验显示，TreeRPO将Qwen-2.5-Math的Pass@1准确率从19.0%提升至35.5%，性能优于GRPO且响应长度减少18.1%。

Conclusion: TreeRPO通过细密奖励信号显著提升了LLM的推理能力和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

Motivation: 扩散重排序方法在数据流形建模中有效，但信号在远离源点时容易衰减，导致局部区域外的判别能力下降。

Method: LPMT框架结合双向协作扩散（BCD）和热力学马尔可夫转移（TMT）过程，通过局部状态嵌入（LSE）增强局部一致性，实现全局检索。

Result: 实验结果表明，LPMT在多种任务中有效提升了实例检索的性能。

Conclusion: LPMT框架通过保留局部性和全局检索的平衡，显著提升了扩散重排序方法的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于通用逼近理论的方法，解释了大语言模型如何通过上下文学习（in-context learning）完成新任务，而无需微调或参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer如何通过上下文学习实现通用任务预测，而非依赖优化算法逼近。

Result: 证明了Transformer可以动态适应上下文示例，并学习通用表示，适用于非线性问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为Transformer的上下文学习能力提供了理论支持，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在节点分类任务中存在度偏差问题，现有GCL方法因正样本对不足和权重分配不均导致低度节点信息不足且噪声多。

Method: 提出HAR对比损失方法，利用节点标签增加正样本对，并根据学习难度自适应加权正负样本对；开发SHARP框架扩展HAR应用场景。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，SHARP在全局和度级别上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAR和SHARP能有效缓解GNN中的度偏差问题，提升节点分类性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Motivation: 现有分布式鲁棒核学习算法多为分治法，缺乏统一框架。本文旨在提出一种去中心化的鲁棒核学习算法，填补这一空白。

Method: 利用图网络表示系统，引入鲁棒损失函数$\mathcal{L}_\sigma$，结合核积分算子技术，分析局部估计器的收敛性。

Result: 算法在均方距离、RKHS范数和泛化误差上均达到最优学习速率，参数$\sigma$对鲁棒性和收敛性至关重要。

Conclusion: 去中心化算法在鲁棒性和收敛性上表现优异，参数选择和样本规模规则为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Motivation: Shapley值在解释机器学习模型决策中至关重要，但精确计算困难。现有随机估计器（如KernelSHAP）缺乏理论保证，亟需统一框架和理论支持。

Method: 提出一个统一框架，涵盖KernelSHAP及相关估计器，采用有/无替换采样策略。通过非渐近理论分析，证明其理论保证，并在决策树模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 在中小维度数据集上，该方法与精确Shapley值相比，均方误差低且样本需求适中。改进实现后，适用于高维数据集（如MNIST、CIFAR10），表现优于KernelSHAP库。

Conclusion: 该研究首次为KernelSHAP提供理论保证，统一了相关估计器框架，并通过实验验证其优越性，为高维数据应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching是一种调度方案，解决了RMTs中的顺序执行瓶颈，显著提升了长上下文推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在长上下文推理中存在时间和内存复杂度高的问题，RMTs虽然降低了复杂度，但顺序执行导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 引入Diagonal Batching调度方案，通过并行化处理段间任务，保留精确递归，无需重新训练现有模型。

Result: 在LLaMA-1B ARMT模型上，Diagonal Batching实现了3.3倍的速度提升，减少了推理成本和延迟。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching使RMTs成为实际长上下文应用的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Method: PTSD通过顺序训练扩散模型，利用PT的优势改进神经采样器训练，并引入新方法结合高温扩散模型生成近似低温样本，再用MCMC微调。

Result: PTSD显著提升了目标评估效率，优于基于扩散的神经采样器，并生成混合良好且不相关的样本。

Conclusion: PTSD通过结合PT和扩散模型，解决了现有方法的不足，为高效采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: 研究展示了通过增加推理时计算成本优化性能的潜力，为神经网络内部解决序列优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Conclusion: MP-SAE通过多迭代方法克服了浅层架构的局限性，为稀疏自编码器在复杂场景中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Conclusion: 该框架为潜在空间对齐提供了新的理论支持和实用方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Method: 分析了一个结构完整但单层的Transformer，包括自注意力、前馈网络和残差连接，研究了梯度下降的收敛行为。

Result: 在适当初始化下，梯度下降具有线性收敛速率，收敛速度由注意力层输出矩阵的最小和最大奇异值决定。残差连接改善了输出矩阵的病态问题，提升了优化稳定性。

Conclusion: 理论分析扩展到多层Transformer，验证了梯度下降的线性收敛速率。实验结果表明残差连接对收敛稳定性的积极作用。

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受物理实现启发，研究旨在开发一种符合物理核心原则的学习算法，以高效模拟和设计动态系统。

Method: 提出RHEL算法，通过非耗散哈密顿系统的物理轨迹计算损失梯度，并引入离散时间版本以模拟哈密顿系统。

Result: RHEL在多种时间序列任务中表现与BPTT相当，适用于长序列建模。

Conclusion: RHEL为可扩展、高效能的物理系统设计提供了新思路，支持自学习能力的序列建模。

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习中通信是主要瓶颈，压缩信息可减少开销，但会降低收敛性。误差反馈方法（如EF和EF²¹）被提出以缓解此问题。

Method: 通过构建最优Lyapunov函数，分析EF和EF²¹的收敛率，并与压缩梯度下降进行公平比较。

Result: 提供了两种方法的紧致收敛率分析，匹配了下界，并展示了其性能差异。

Conclusion: 研究为误差反馈方法提供了清晰的理论基础和性能比较，有助于优化分布式学习的通信效率。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Motivation: 当前时间序列生成方法难以同时满足点级和段级的精确控制需求，CocktailEdit旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 实验证明该框架在多种数据集和模型上有效，能够满足实际编辑需求。

Conclusion: CocktailEdit为时间序列生成与编辑提供了灵活解决方案，填补了生成模型与实际需求之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

TL;DR: Fast-DataShapley提出了一种高效计算Shapley值的方法，避免了重复训练，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI行业中，训练数据的价值和版权至关重要，但现有Shapley值计算方法计算复杂度高且需重复训练，成本高昂。

Method: 利用加权最小二乘法的Shapley值特性，训练可复用的解释模型，并提出三种降低训练开销的方法。

Result: 实验表明，性能提升2.5倍以上，训练速度提高两个数量级。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley在理论和实验上均表现出色，为数据贡献评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Motivation: 动态系统的数据驱动建模通常缺乏泛化能力，尤其是在训练数据未覆盖的区域。本文旨在证明储层计算可以在没有显式结构先验的情况下实现泛化。

Method: 提出了一种多轨迹训练方案，利用多个不相交时间序列训练储层计算机，并将其应用于多稳态动态系统。

Result: 实验表明，即使在单个吸引盆中训练的RC也能捕捉未观测吸引盆中的系统行为，实现域外泛化。

Conclusion: 储层计算在多轨迹训练方案下，能够有效泛化到未观测的动态系统区域，为数据驱动建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆（BC）方法在模仿学习中仅能学习专家访问过的状态，导致代理在偏离演示支持范围时无法恢复。本文旨在通过L2S方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SAILOR方法，结合世界模型和奖励模型，通过计划匹配专家结果，实现稳定且高效的恢复行为学习。

Result: 在多个视觉操作任务中，SAILOR表现优于基于BC的Diffusion Policies，即使增加5-10倍的演示数据，BC仍存在性能差距。

Conclusion: SAILOR能够识别细微错误并避免奖励欺骗，展示了在模仿学习中超越BC的潜力。

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Result: 自一致性需要更多样本，最佳-n效率更高；自校正方法使Transformer能够模拟在线学习，适用于多任务场景。

Conclusion: 自校正方法在多任务中具有理论支持和实际效果，扩展了Transformer的表征能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

Motivation: 由于GPU内存带宽限制，特别是在注意力计算中HBM和SRAM之间的数据传输，高效推理仍然具有挑战性。现有近似方法依赖昂贵的top-k操作，性能不佳。

Method: 提出SiftAttention，用基于阈值的元素过滤操作替代top-k步骤，动态估计每个生成步骤的阈值，仅加载和使用高于阈值的注意力分数和值向量。

Result: SiftAttention在减少内存带宽使用的同时，比现有近似方法更好地保持了模型质量。

Conclusion: SiftAttention通过动态阈值过滤提供了一种高效且质量保持的近似注意力方法。

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Conclusion: 能量模型能够有效学习高维数据的概率分布，并揭示了图像概率与局部邻域维度的变化关系。

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

Conclusion: AI框架为QPI核提取提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“嫁接”的方法，通过编辑预训练的扩散变换器（DiTs）来研究新架构设计，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估模型架构决策需要昂贵的预训练，限制了架构探索。受软件开发的启发，研究是否可以利用预训练模型研究新架构设计。

Method: 提出“嫁接”方法，通过编辑预训练DiTs实现新架构设计，包括替换注意力机制和MLPs等操作。

Result: 实验表明，嫁接设计在低计算成本下（<2%预训练计算）仍能保持高质量（FID: 2.38-2.64）。文本到图像模型嫁接后速度提升1.43倍，性能下降<2%。

Conclusion: 嫁接方法为扩散模型设计提供了高效探索途径，支持从操作替换到架构重构的多种编辑。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过压缩KV缓存实现推理时超扩展，提升推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer LLMs中推理成本受KV缓存大小限制，而非生成token数量，因此探索通过压缩KV缓存提升效率。

Method: 提出动态内存稀疏化（DMS），延迟token淘汰并隐式合并表示，仅需1K训练步骤实现8倍压缩。

Result: 在多个LLM家族中验证有效性，如Qwen-R1 32B在AIME 24、GPQA和LiveCodeBench上平均提升9.1、7.6和9.6分。

Conclusion: DMS通过高效压缩KV缓存，在相同计算预算下显著提升推理准确性。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

TL;DR: 论文研究了用户在推荐系统中的利他行为，分析了其对用户社会福利和推荐系统效用的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究用户在推荐系统中如何通过策略性互动影响推荐内容，尤其是大规模用户集体行为（利他行为）对系统的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较了用户真实偏好报告和利他策略下的社会福利，并提出了有效的利他策略算法。

Result: 理论分析表明，利他行为能显著提高用户社会福利，甚至提升推荐系统效用；实证结果支持了理论结论。

Conclusion: 传统推荐系统可能激励用户形成集体或采取利他策略，研究为这一现象提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys)
(e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to
influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been
documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to
purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to
"boost" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture
this behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide
the RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to
them, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates
a low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user
her (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare
under truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing
user altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to
ensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide
an algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show
that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic
strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are
robust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions.
Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective
altruistic strategies on the GoodReads dataset, and an online survey on how
real-world users behave altruistically in RecSys. Overall, our findings serve
as a proof-of-concept of the reasons why traditional RecSys may incentivize
users to form collectives and/or follow altruistic strategies when interacting
with them.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community
has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player
(MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method
is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data,
which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We
aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework,
denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses
feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP
ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

TL;DR: AbBiBench是一个抗体结合亲和力成熟和设计的基准框架，通过评估抗体-抗原复合物的功能潜力来改进现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体评估方法仅关注抗体本身或其与天然抗体的相似性，忽略了抗体-抗原复合物的功能单元特性。

Method: AbBiBench基于抗体-抗原复合物的模型似然性评估抗体设计潜力，并使用9个数据集和14种蛋白质模型进行系统比较。

Result: 结构条件逆向折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: AbBiBench为开发更有效的功能感知抗体设计模型提供了统一的生物学基础评估框架。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据多模态且复杂，但可能共享同一生理状态信息。通过潜在空间假设，统一表示这些数据，以揭示疾病亚型和个体化健康轨迹。

Method: 利用潜在空间假设，将多模态医学数据映射到统一的学习几何表示中，通过编码器和持续学习技术分析疾病轨迹和治疗向量。

Result: 框架能够揭示疾病亚型、个体化健康轨迹和治疗方向，为个性化医疗提供定量依据。

Conclusion: 该框架为个性化医疗提供了新思路，但仍需解决数据偏差、稀缺性和隐私等问题，未来可通过持续学习和扰动验证进一步优化。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

TL;DR: R2Rec是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的推荐框架，通过模拟逐步推理来提升推荐效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法在推荐任务中效果不佳，因为用户反馈是隐式的且缺乏推理监督。

Method: R2Rec通过采样用户-物品交互链并将其转换为结构化推理步骤，结合监督微调和强化学习进行训练。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，R2Rec在HitRatio@1上平均提升10.48%，并显著优于原始LLM。

Conclusion: R2Rec通过显式推理链提升了推荐性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有攻击方法缺乏隐蔽性，容易被检测和防御，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击设计和更有效的防御策略。

Method: 提出了一种基于注意力模式的Normalized Passage Attention Score和Attention-Variance Filter算法，用于检测和过滤被毒化的段落。

Result: 该方法显著提升了防御效果，准确率比基线防御提高了约20%，但面对更隐蔽的自适应攻击时，攻击成功率仍可达35%。

Conclusion: 论文强调了隐蔽攻击的挑战，并展示了基于注意力模式的防御方法的潜力与局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

Motivation: 解决在敏感医疗数据上微调LLM时的隐私风险问题，防止数据泄露。

Method: 使用50,232份放射学报告，通过差分隐私低秩适应（DP-LoRA）在高中等隐私预算下微调LLM，评估了BERT和ALBERT模型的性能。

Result: 实验显示隐私与性能之间存在权衡，中等隐私保障下模型性能接近非隐私基线（MIMIC-CXR F1 0.88 vs 0.90，CT-RATE F1 0.59 vs 0.78）。

Conclusion: DP-LoRA方法能有效实现隐私保护的多异常分类，为医疗数据上的LLM微调提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Motivation: 在基于扰动的防御机制下，传统编码器窃取攻击性能受限，需要一种方法突破防御。

Method: BESA包含扰动检测和恢复模块，检测防御机制并生成干净特征向量，结合现有攻击方法。

Result: 实验表明，BESA在面对先进防御时，将替代编码器准确率提升高达24.63%。

Conclusion: BESA有效提升了编码器窃取攻击在防御环境下的性能。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Result: 数据集支持多种任务，并首次包含未被检测到的恶意文件，促进研究可重复性。

Conclusion: EMBER2024为恶意软件研究提供了更全面的数据集，推动了新研究方向。

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

Result: 案例研究表明，改进方法在不增加计算成本的情况下，显著提升了记忆审计的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为大型序列模型的可靠记忆审计提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于Otto-Wasserstein几何的概率分布集合上的测地主成分分析（GPCA），旨在识别概率测度空间中最佳捕捉数据集变化模式的地测线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究概率分布集合中的变化模式，通过地测线分析揭示数据集的主要变化方向。

Method: 首先针对高斯分布集合，提出在可逆线性映射空间中的计算方法；对于绝对连续概率测度，利用神经网络参数化Wasserstein空间中的地测线。

Result: 通过多种示例与传统切空间PCA进行比较，并在真实数据集上进行了验证。

Conclusion: GPCA方法能够有效捕捉概率分布集合中的主要变化模式，优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a
collection of probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry.
The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures
that best capture the modes of variation of the underlying dataset. We first
address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新型无模型强化学习算法，旨在降低样本需求和通信成本，同时保持最优遗憾性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中数据收集和策略部署成本高昂，研究单智能体和联邦强化学习的样本需求和通信成本最小化问题。

Method: 提出Q-EarlySettled-LowCost和FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost算法，结合线性样本需求和低通信成本。

Result: 算法在最优遗憾、线性样本需求和低通信成本方面表现最佳，并改进了理论边界。

Conclusion: 新算法在降低成本和保持性能方面具有显著优势，适用于高成本场景。

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

*Sébastien Da Veiga*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分布编码（DE）的改进方法，用于处理高斯过程（GP）回归中分类变量的挑战，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工程应用中，观测数据获取成本高，而GP回归和贝叶斯优化（BO）是常用方法。然而，当输入变量为分类变量时，构建高效且预测性强的GP仍具挑战性。

Method: 从目标编码出发，提出基于分布编码（DE）的改进方法，利用目标变量的全部分布信息，并结合特征核理论（如最大均值差异和Wasserstein距离）处理编码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上表现出色，达到了当前最优的预测性能。

Conclusion: 分布编码（DE）为处理分类变量提供了有效解决方案，并能与离散和混合空间中的BO最新进展自然结合。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何仅通过观测数据和单变量干预数据推断联合干预效果，提出了一种可识别性结果和实用估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多领域中，估计多变量联合干预的因果效应至关重要，但获取联合干预数据具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种可识别性结果，证明对于一类非线性加性结果机制，无需联合干预数据即可推断联合效应；并设计了一种实用估计器，将因果效应分解为每个干预变量的混杂和非混杂贡献。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验表明，该方法性能接近直接使用联合干预数据训练的模型，优于纯观测估计器。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅通过观测和单变量干预数据即可有效推断联合干预效果，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多领域（如神经科学、心理学、社会科学和工业制造）中，因果关系的单位是变量组而非单个标量变量，现有方法对此支持不足。

Method: 采用两步法：先推断随机向量间的因果顺序，再选择与顺序一致的因果图模型。

Result: 在模拟中表现优异，并成功应用于实际装配线数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为多变量组的因果推断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems
with latent confounders.

TL;DR: 在最佳臂识别问题中，当实验者可以选择自适应试验时，忽略此选项而运行非自适应试验是不可取的。研究发现，当至少有三个处理臂时，简单的自适应设计普遍且严格优于非自适应完全随机试验。

Motivation: 探讨在最佳臂识别问题中，自适应试验是否优于非自适应试验，并解决Qin [2022]提出的第二个开放问题。

Method: 研究批处理臂消除设计，逐步淘汰表现不佳的臂，并分析其在统计效率上的优势。

Result: 当至少有三个处理臂时，简单的自适应设计在统计效率上普遍且严格优于非自适应完全随机试验。

Conclusion: 自适应设计在最佳臂识别问题中具有显著优势，尤其是在处理臂较多时。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

TL;DR: BEAR是一个利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动生成BGP异常事件报告的框架，通过多步推理将表格数据转化为详细文本，提高可解释性和分析精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP异常（如路由泄漏和劫持）威胁网络可靠性和安全，现有方法依赖专家知识解释事件，BEAR旨在自动化这一过程。

Method: BEAR结合LLM的多步推理和合成数据生成框架，将BGP数据转化为文本报告。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，BEAR达到100%准确率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BEAR开创了自动化解释BGP异常事件的先河，为网络管理提供实用洞察。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态信道分配方法，结合了BAI-MCTS和LLM技术，显著提升了WiFi 7网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi 7的MLO功能在密集网络中面临信道分配挑战，现有研究多关注静态配置，本文旨在解决动态环境下的优化问题。

Method: 将问题建模为组合优化，采用MAB框架和BAI-MCTS算法，并引入LLM进一步优化。

Result: BAI-MCTS收敛速度比现有算法快50.44%，LLM-BAI-MCTS在密集网络中提升63.32%。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在动态信道分配中表现优异，为WiFi 7网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Motivation: 移动网络运营商的数据利用不足，而OTT玩家主导市场。数据分析被视为提升价值和避免业务风险的关键。

Method: 分析了70多篇文献的趋势和空白，并提出了两个新的NWDAF用例。

Result: 研究发现现有研究局限于少数方法和用例，新用例有助于推动NWDAF的采用和商业化。

Conclusion: NWDAF具有巨大潜力，需更多研究探索其多样化应用和商业价值。

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Neural ODEs的数据驱动框架，用于从PDE系统中学习降维矩动力学，适用于稀疏和不规则时间序列数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如SINDy）需要密集采样且对噪声敏感，而Neural ODEs能直接从稀疏数据中建模矩轨迹，更具鲁棒性。

Method: 利用Neural ODEs直接建模矩轨迹，并通过Stiefel流形优化实现数据驱动的坐标变换，以发现低维表示。

Result: 在非线性薛定谔方程中准确恢复矩动力学；在无解析闭合的系统中（如Fisher-KPP反应扩散系统），Neural ODEs仍能有效逼近未闭合矩动力学，且外推精度优于物理专家模型。

Conclusion: Neural ODE框架是一种强大且灵活的工具，适用于复杂PDE系统中学习可解释的低维矩动力学。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散变换器的去噪框架，用于快速生成高质量的质子治疗剂量图，解决了低统计量蒙特卡罗模拟的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质子调强治疗（IMPT）对解剖变化敏感，需要频繁的在线自适应放疗（oART），而快速准确的蒙特卡罗模拟是关键。低统计量模拟虽快但精度不足，因此需要去噪方法。

Method: 开发了基于扩散变换器的去噪框架，使用80例头颈部患者的IMPT计划和CT图像生成噪声和高统计量剂量图，并通过多种损失函数训练模型。

Result: 模型在不同部位的剂量图去噪中表现优异，平均绝对误差低，3D Gamma通过率高，DVH指标接近真实值。

Conclusion: 该去噪框架虽仅基于头颈部数据训练，但在多部位疾病中泛化能力强，为快速高质量剂量生成提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在训练神经网络时需结合数据、微分方程残差和目标成本，导致架构复杂。本文旨在简化这一过程，证明无需在训练中包含成本函数。

Method: 使用简单的神经算子架构（如DeepONet）结合无约束优化方法，通过在成本函数中添加微分方程残差的惩罚项，并利用自动微分计算控制梯度。

Result: 在九个不同的最优控制问题上验证了方法的有效性，通过训练三个DeepONet模型分别对应不同微分方程，每个模型解决三个不同成本函数的问题，表现一致且准确。

Conclusion: 研究表明，解耦最优控制问题与训练过程是可行的，简化了架构并提高了效率，适用于多种最优控制问题。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Motivation: 解决随机多目标优化问题中传统方法计算资源消耗大的问题。

Method: MOPBnB(so)算法在任意解处仅评估一次噪声函数，利用邻域解估计目标函数。

Result: 算法在确定性问题上具有有限时间性能保证，在随机问题上渐近收敛。数值结果显示其计算效率优于多次复制的变体，且性能优于遗传算法NSGA-II。

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so)是一种高效且性能优越的多目标优化算法，适用于随机多目标问题。

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从水分测量数据中准确估计土壤特性，尤其是扩散率D和导水率K。

Method: 使用Fokas方法模拟数据，并比较多种机器学习模型（如SVM和NN）在不同数据条件下的表现。

Result: SVM和NN模型在预测扩散率D时表现最优，导水率K的预测准确性较低。

Conclusion: SVM和NN模型在土壤特性估计中具有高鲁棒性和准确性，尤其是在预测扩散率D时。

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床中至关重要，但手动标注耗时费力。本研究旨在通过XR技术提供更直观、高效的分割工具。

Method: 开发了一个沉浸式界面，支持实时交互2D和3D医学图像数据，结合手写笔驱动标注和即时3D体积渲染。使用公共颅面CT数据集进行用户研究。

Result: 工具的系统可用性评分（SUS）为66，用户对其直观控制和空间交互设计评价较高（4.1/5）。但任务精度和错误管理仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: XR-手写笔范式为沉浸式分割工具提供了有前景的基础，未来可通过触觉反馈校准和工作流个性化进一步优化。

Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation is essential in clinical settings for diagnosing
diseases, planning surgeries, and other procedures. However, manual annotation
is a cumbersome and effortful task. To mitigate these aspects, this study
implements and evaluates the usability and clinical applicability of an
extended reality (XR)-based segmentation tool for anatomical CT scans, using
the Meta Quest 3 headset and Logitech MX Ink stylus. We develop an immersive
interface enabling real-time interaction with 2D and 3D medical imaging data in
a customizable workspace designed to mitigate workflow fragmentation and
cognitive demands inherent to conventional manual segmentation tools. The
platform combines stylus-driven annotation, mirroring traditional pen-on-paper
workflows, with instant 3D volumetric rendering. A user study with a public
craniofacial CT dataset demonstrated the tool's foundational viability,
achieving a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 66, within the expected range
for medical applications. Participants highlighted the system's intuitive
controls (scoring 4.1/5 for self-descriptiveness on ISONORM metrics) and
spatial interaction design, with qualitative feedback highlighting strengths in
hybrid 2D/3D navigation and realistic stylus ergonomics. While users identified
opportunities to enhance task-specific precision and error management, the
platform's core workflow enabled dynamic slice adjustment, reducing cognitive
load compared to desktop tools. Results position the XR-stylus paradigm as a
promising foundation for immersive segmentation tools, with iterative
refinements targeting haptic feedback calibration and workflow personalization
to advance adoption in preoperative planning.

Motivation: 现有团队优化工具依赖静态数据或特定场景算法，无法适应动态团队互动和成员偏好变化，导致成员不满和绩效下降。

Method: 1. 多臂老虎机算法优化团队形成；2. AI助手tAIfa提供个性化反馈；3. LLM框架PuppeteerLLM模拟团队动态。

Result: 提出的框架和系统能够动态优化团队形成与互动，提升满意度、凝聚力和绩效。

Conclusion: AI增强的团队优化工具能有效解决动态团队管理中的挑战，为团队科学提供新方向。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically

TL;DR: ChemReservoir是一个开源框架，用于化学启发的储层计算，解决了先前DNA化学工具的限制，并提供了更好的测试、评估和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前基于DNA化学的储层计算工具存在维护不足和通用性差的问题，需要一种更通用的开源工具。

Result: 在内存容量任务中，ChemReservoir表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: ChemReservoir为化学启发的储层计算提供了一个通用且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于CEGAR的扩展方法来解决量化整数规划（QIP）问题，并将其应用于多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题，实验结果表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QIP结合了量化布尔公式（QBF）和整数规划的优势，但现有方法仅限于搜索范式。论文旨在探索扩展范式，以提升QIP的求解效率和适用性。

Method: 采用基于CEGAR的扩展方法，借鉴QBF技术，并将其嵌入优化框架，以处理多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在特定实例中优于现有的QIP搜索求解器，且在性能上超越了QBF的扩展求解器。

Conclusion: 扩展方法为QIP提供了新的求解范式，显著提升了性能，尤其在多阶段鲁棒优化问题中表现出色。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面太阳望远镜的高分辨率观测受限于地球大气湍流，传统重建方法在强湍流和高计算成本下表现不佳。

Method: 采用无配对图像到图像转换的深度学习模型，将100张短曝光图像实时重建为一张高质量图像，训练数据为退化的图像和参考的散斑重建图像。

Result: 该方法在感知质量上表现出更强的鲁棒性，尤其在散斑重建存在伪影时效果显著，且能充分利用图像序列信息。

Conclusion: 该深度学习方法在提供完整图像序列时能实现最佳重建效果，为太阳观测提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be
resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths
turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction
methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and
high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that
reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real
time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on
degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving
robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms
of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts.
An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our
method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the
best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

Conclusion: 针对不同门层选择最优模拟方法可显著提升量子机器学习算法的模拟效率。

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Conclusion: hdl2v数据集为LLM生成Verilog代码提供了有效支持，未来可进一步扩展其特性以优化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better

Conclusion: 未来研究将整合所有组件，实现完整的QiMeng系统。

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

Result: 在102个手动整理的基因集上，cGSA比基线方法表现优30%以上，专家验证其精确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: cGSA在黑色素瘤和乳腺癌案例中展示了其发现上下文特异性见解的潜力，支持针对性假设生成。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了物理自组织与人工智能之间的深层联系，为高效光学计算实现开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型实现存在GPU利用率低、延迟高和无法利用任务局部性的问题。

Method: 开发FlashDMoE，通过单持久GPU内核融合专家计算和GPU间通信，实现细粒度流水线。

Result: 在8-H100 GPU节点上，FlashDMoE实现了6倍延迟降低、5.7倍吞吐提升和9倍GPU利用率提升。

Conclusion: FlashDMoE证明了GPU内核-硬件协同设计对大规模分布式ML性能的关键作用。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using

Method: POSSM通过交叉注意力模块对单个尖峰进行标记化，并采用递归状态空间模型作为主干，支持快速在线预测和多数据集预训练。

Result: 在猴子和人类任务中，POSSM的解码精度与最先进的Transformer相当，但推理速度快9倍。

Conclusion: 混合SSM是平衡准确性、推理速度和泛化能力的有效方法，适用于实时闭环神经解码。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

### [353] [A Multi-Dataset Evaluation of Models for Automated Vulnerability Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04987)
*Zanis Ali Khan,Aayush Garg,Qiang Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了预训练语言模型CodeBERT和CodeT5在自动漏洞修复中的表现，发现CodeBERT在稀疏上下文表现更好，而CodeT5在复杂漏洞模式识别和扩展性上更优。微调模型在已知数据上表现提升，但对未知数据泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，而自动漏洞修复（APR）中的漏洞修补研究不足，因此研究预训练语言模型在漏洞修复中的应用。

Method: 使用CodeBERT和CodeT5模型，在六个数据集和四种语言上进行自动漏洞修复实验，评估其准确性和泛化能力。

Result: CodeBERT在稀疏上下文表现更好，CodeT5在复杂漏洞模式和扩展性上更优。微调模型在已知数据上表现提升，但对未知数据泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究为自动漏洞修复提供了基准和实用见解，但模型泛化能力仍需改进。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

TL;DR: CoRAL是一个基于深度学习的框架，利用强化学习自动生成代码审查评论，通过奖励机制评估评论的语义和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码审查耗时且受主观因素影响，自动化工具可提高效率。

Method: 结合强化学习和奖励机制，生成语义相似且实用的评论。

Result: CoRAL在生成评论方面优于现有基线技术。

Conclusion: CoRAL有效提升了代码审查自动化的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义的噪声调度，可能损害感知一致性，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用连续时间扩散模型，引入SSIMBaD技术，通过sigma空间变换对齐感知退化。

Result: 在大规模动漫面部数据集上，方法在像素精度和感知质量上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SSIMBaD框架在保持结构保真度的同时，实现了多样风格的上色，代码已开源。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于手柄的网格变形方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）通过提示工程实现高质量变形。


<details>

Motivation: 现有网格变形方法存在输出质量低、需手动调整或依赖数据训练的问题，需改进。

Method: 通过锥形奇点检测识别手柄，利用VLM选择变形子部分和手柄，并通过多视角投票减少预测不确定性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法生成的变形更符合用户意图，且引入的失真较低。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、高度自动化，能持续提供高质量的网格变形。

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实例中心的3D语义占用预测方法VoxDet，通过将体素级分类任务转化为实例级检测任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D语义占用预测视为密集分割任务，忽略了实例级的区分性，导致实例不完整和相邻模糊问题。论文发现体素级标签隐含实例级信息，提出利用这一免费信息。

Method: 提出VoxDet框架，包括训练免费的Voxel-to-Instance（VoxNT）技巧和实例中心的任务分解方法。具体包括空间解耦体素编码器和任务解耦密集预测器。

Result: VoxDet在相机和LiDAR输入上均达到SOTA性能，在SemanticKITTI测试集上获得63.0 IoU，排名第一。

Conclusion: VoxDet通过实例级任务分解和特征解耦，高效解决了3D语义占用预测中的实例模糊问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

Result: 该方法在Rosin度量下表现优异，且对几何变换具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方案在速度和美学上均优于现有技术，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

Conclusion: 神经网络离散化与Rayleigh商和Gram-Schmidt正交化的结合为连续特征值问题提供了简单且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

Conclusion: 通过针对机构声望的干预措施，可以有效改善学术合作网络中的不平等，提升研究者的职业发展机会。

Abstract: Social factors such as demographic traits and institutional prestige
structure the creation and dissemination of ideas in academic publishing. One
place these effects can be observed is in how central or peripheral a
researcher is in the coauthorship network. Here we investigate inequities in
network centrality in a hand-collected data set of 5,670 U.S.-based faculty
employed in Ph.D.-granting Computer Science departments and their DBLP
coauthorship connections. We introduce algorithms for combining name- and
perception-based demographic labels by maximizing alignment with self-reported
demographics from a survey of faculty from our census. We find that women and
individuals with minoritized race identities are less central in the computer
science coauthorship network, implying worse access to and ability to spread
information. Centrality is also highly correlated with prestige, such that
faculty in top-ranked departments are at the core and those in low-ranked
departments are in the peripheries of the computer science coauthorship
network. We show that these disparities can be mitigated using simulated edge
interventions, interpreted as facilitated collaborations. Our intervention
increases the centrality of target individuals, chosen independently of the
network structure, by linking them with researchers from highly ranked
institutions. When applied to scholars during their Ph.D., the intervention
also improves the predicted rank of their placement institution in the academic
job market. This work was guided by an ameliorative approach: uncovering social
inequities in order to address them. By targeting scholars for intervention
based on institutional prestige, we are able to improve their centrality in the
coauthorship network that plays a key role in job placement and longer-term
academic success.

Abstract: Memory effects play a crucial role in social interactions and decision-making
processes. This paper proposes a novel fractional-order bounded confidence
opinion dynamics model to characterize the memory effects in system states.
Building upon the Hegselmann-Krause framework and fractional-order difference,
a comprehensive model is established that captures the persistent influence of
historical information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the fundamental
properties including convergence and consensus is investigated. The results
demonstrate that the proposed model not only maintains favorable convergence
and consensus characteristics compared to classical opinion dynamics, but also
addresses limitations such as the monotonicity of bounded opinions. This
enables a more realistic representation of opinion evolution in real-world
scenarios. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodological
approaches for understanding opinion formation and evolution, offering both
theoretical significance and practical applications.

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan

contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to

Conclusion: RoboRefer在多步空间推理和动态任务执行中表现卓越，适用于多样化机器人场景。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

*Haokun Liu,Zhaoqi Ma,Yunong Li,Junichiro Sugihara,Yicheng Chen,Jinjie Li,Moju Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM和VLM的分层框架，用于异构多机器人系统在动态环境中的任务协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态模型难以应对任务多样性和动态环境，需要一种通用智能来协调异构机器人的高层推理与低层执行。

Method: 采用分层框架，LLM负责任务分解和全局语义地图构建，VLM从航拍图像中提取语义标签和空间信息支持局部规划。

Result: 实验证明框架在动态环境中具有适应性和鲁棒性，首次展示了VLM感知与LLM任务推理和运动规划的结合。

Conclusion: 该框架为异构多机器人系统在复杂任务中的协作提供了新思路，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

<details>

Motivation: 解决越野自主性中地形可通行性依赖车辆状态的问题，避免大数据集需求和高计算成本。

Method: 使用傅里叶基函数构建平滑解析函数，预测任意接近角度的风险分布。

Result: 在仿真中成功率达到91%，硬件测试验证了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARTA方法高效且泛化能力强，适用于复杂地形导航。

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of
algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we
introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed
along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing
environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to
integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its
robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve
spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around
38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight
serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection
algorithms. Our dataset is available at

Result: 合成数据训练的检测器在机器人足球场景中表现与真实数据相当，结合两者可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人领域提供了一种高效、可扩展的数据集生成方案，减少了手动标注需求。

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the
agent to efficiently navigate in a partially observable environment and predict
the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for
mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable
representation of open-vocabulary 3D scene graph. To accelerate and stabilize
the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim
environment showed that using a 3D scene graph for reinforcement learning
significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The

Result: 在真实机器人手臂上验证了校准流程，并展示了其在冷启动嗅觉导航任务中的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人手术和无接触安检等应用提供了可行的OIO校准解决方案。

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

Conclusion: 该技术在分析化学、传感器技术和电池科学等领域具有广泛应用前景，特别是在需要快速电化学定量的场景。

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

Conclusion: kTULA在采样高维双势阱分布和神经网络优化问题中表现优异，理论结果为其性能提供了保证。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer

Result: 实验证明攻击者可以高保真地重构用户的大批量微调图像数据。

Conclusion: 研究强调了PEFT中隐私保护机制的必要性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

Result: 显著提升低光条件下的图像可见性和亮度，同时保持结构完整和色彩一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低光图像的去噪与增强问题，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

Motivation: 传统2D CNN在超分辨率任务中依赖局部邻域，缺乏全局上下文理解，且受限于波段相关性和数据稀缺性。

Method: DACN采用增强卷积和多头注意力捕捉局部和全局特征依赖，通过通道和空间维度的注意力图确定关注点，并使用优化的损失函数（L2正则化和空间-光谱梯度损失）确保光谱保真度。

Result: 在两个高光谱数据集上的实验表明，多头注意力和通道注意力的组合优于单独使用任一注意力机制。

Conclusion: DACN通过双注意力机制和优化损失函数，显著提升了高光谱图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学SSM模型存在编码器-解码器不兼容问题，1D序列扁平化破坏空间结构，而传统解码器无法利用Mamba的状态传播能力。

Method: 采用四方向3D扫描的Mamba模块保持空间一致性，门控空间卷积增强特征表示，Mamba驱动的解码框架实现跨尺度状态同步。

Result: 在Synapse和BraTS2023数据集上分别达到85.44%和90.22%的DSC，表现最优。

Conclusion: DM-SegNet通过创新设计有效结合了全局上下文与空间拓扑，显著提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

market trading, focusing on two algorithms: Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and compares them with Buy and Hold
benchmark. It evaluates these algorithms across three currency pairs, the S&P
500 index and Bitcoin, on the daily data in the period of 2019-2023. The
results demonstrate DRL's effectiveness in trading and its ability to manage
risk by strategically avoiding trades in unfavorable conditions, providing a
substantial edge over classical approaches, based on supervised learning in
terms of risk-adjusted returns.

### [382] [Domain Adaptation Method and Modality Gap Impact in Audio-Text Models for Prototypical Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04376)
*Emiliano Acevedo,Martín Rocamora,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过量化背景声源的影响并整合到分类过程中，提升零样本环境声音分类性能，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-文本模型在零样本环境声音分类中表现优异，但在背景声源存在时性能显著下降。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种量化背景声源贡献的方法，并通过领域适应技术优化分类性能，同时分析音频与文本嵌入的模态差距。

Result: 方法显著提升了分类性能，适应不同背景和信噪比条件，且适用于多种先进原型方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性和鲁棒性，适用于多样化环境，且通过缩小模态差距进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类计算的方法，通过用户反馈逐步改进AI音乐生成模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI音乐生成模型通常基于固定数据集训练，难以准确响应用户输入，而音乐具有高度主观性，需要个性化。

Method: 采用人类计算方法，通过用户评分作为损失函数微调模型，并结合遗传算法优化性能。

Result: 初步测试显示，第一轮迭代评分平均提高0.2，第二轮进一步提高了0.39。

Conclusion: 该方法通过用户反馈有效提升了AI音乐生成的性能，证明了人类计算在个性化音乐生成中的潜力。

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

TL;DR: JurisCTC是一种新型模型，用于改进法律判决预测任务，通过对比学习实现跨法律领域的知识迁移，在民事和刑事法律领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律文本复杂且标注数据有限的问题，探索无监督领域适应在法律领域的应用。

Method: 提出JurisCTC模型，采用对比学习区分不同领域的样本，实现民事与刑事法律领域的知识迁移。

Result: JurisCTC在民事和刑事法律领域的准确率分别达到76.59%和78.83%，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: JurisCTC在法律判决预测任务中表现出色，为跨法律领域的知识迁移提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has gained significant
attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to its
ability to enhance model generalization across diverse domains. However, its
application for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains
largely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex
legal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we
propose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal
Judgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC
facilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and
employs contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains.
Specifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and
criminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language
models (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak
accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs评测主要关注STEM领域，忽视了HSS领域的独特需求，如跨学科思维和抽象概念与视觉表征的关联。

Method: 提出HSSBench，包含13,000多个样本，覆盖六类任务，并通过专家与自动化代理协作的数据生成流程构建。

Result: 评测20多个主流MLLMs，发现即使是先进模型也面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench有望推动MLLMs跨学科推理能力的研究，特别是在知识整合与连接方面。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过字典学习分解句子嵌入为可解释的组件，揭示其内部结构和潜在特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子嵌入在现代NLP和AI系统中至关重要，但其内部结构不透明，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用字典学习对词级表示进行分解，分析池化操作如何压缩特征为句子表示。

Result: 发现嵌入中许多语义和句法特征是线性编码的。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了句子嵌入的透明性和可控性，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估55个公开LLM在低资源语言马耳他语上的表现，发现多数模型表现不佳，尤其是生成任务，而小型微调模型表现更好。预训练和指令调优中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在低资源语言（如马耳他语）上的表现，揭示其局限性并提出改进方向。

Method: 使用包含11个判别和生成任务的新基准测试55个公开LLM，分析影响性能的多维因素。

Result: 多数LLM表现不佳，尤其是生成任务；小型微调模型表现更好；预训练和指令调优中对马耳他语的接触是关键。

Conclusion: 建议研究低资源语言时考虑传统语言建模方法，强调更包容的语言技术需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能像人类一样泛化罕见语法形式及其意义。

Method: 测试人类规模的Transformer模型对英语LET-ALONE结构的语法形式和意义的理解。

Result: 模型能泛化形式，但对意义的泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义的样本效率上存在不对称性，与人类学习者不同。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在理解多义性话语粒子（如“just”）时的能力，揭示其局限性。

Method: 使用专家标注的数据集，分析LLMs对“just”不同语义的区分能力。

Result: LLMs能区分“just”的宽泛语义类别，但对更细微的语义差异理解不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解话语粒子的细微语义方面存在局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标在非洲低资源语言中表现不佳，缺乏公开数据集和一致性。

Method: 构建了包含13种非洲语言的SSA-MTE数据集，并开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标，同时测试了基于提示的LLM方法。

Result: SSA-COMET显著优于AfriCOMET，并在低资源语言（如Twi、Luo和Yoruba）中表现优异。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE和SSA-COMET为非洲低资源语言的机器翻译评估提供了有效工具，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同LLMs和提示策略在金融情感分析中与人类标注情感的一致性，挑战推理能力提升模型表现的假设。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较三种专有LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）在不同提示范式下的表现，并对比两个金融微调模型。

Result: 推理能力（通过提示或模型设计）未提升表现，GPT-4o无推理提示表现最佳；推理可能导致过度思考，降低预测准确性。

Conclusion: 金融情感分类中，快速直觉的“系统1”思维比慢速推理的“系统2”更接近人类判断，挑战推理总是提升决策的假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于检索增强语言模型的事实核查系统在处理对抗性声明时的困难。

Method: SUCEA框架分三步：声明分割与去上下文化、迭代证据检索与声明编辑、证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个数据集上显著提升了检索和标签预测的准确性，优于四种基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA框架有效提升了对抗性声明的事实核查能力。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Method: 提出$Safe$框架，使用Lean 4形式化语言在每个推理步骤中表达数学声明并提供形式化证明。还提出了$FormalStep$基准数据集。

Result: 在多个LLM和数学数据集上验证了$Safe$框架的有效性，显著提升了性能，并提供了可解释和可验证的证据。

Conclusion: $Safe$是首个利用Lean 4形式化语言验证LLM生成内容的框架，为减少幻觉提供了新方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic

followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: MMRefine是一个多模态细化基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的错误细化能力，涵盖六种场景和错误类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理过程中对增强推理能力的关注增加，需要评估MLLMs在检测和纠正错误方面的能力，而不仅仅是比较细化前后的最终准确性。

Method: MMRefine提供了一个框架，通过六种场景和六种错误类型评估MLLMs的细化能力，并使用多种开放和封闭的MLLMs进行实验。

Result: 实验揭示了阻碍细化性能的瓶颈和因素，指出了有效推理增强的改进方向。

Conclusion: MMRefine为MLLMs的错误细化能力提供了评估框架，并公开了代码和数据集，以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at
https://github.com/naver-ai/MMRefine.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为C²EFND的新框架，结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和小型语言模型（SLMs）的优势，通过多轮协作学习和持续知识更新，显著提升了假新闻检测的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在社交媒体上的传播对社会造成严重影响，现有方法（如SLMs和LLMs）因数据稀缺、知识过时等问题难以有效应对。

Method: 提出C²EFND框架，结合LLMs的泛化能力和SLMs的分类专长，采用多轮协作学习，并引入基于Mixture-of-Experts的知识编辑模块和基于回放的持续学习方法。

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的实验表明，C²EFND显著优于现有方法，提高了检测准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架为解决假新闻检测中的持续性和适应性挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs的政治观点，提出多维度政治学习框架，通过可解释的表示工程技术揭示LLMs内部政治状态，并验证其有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖LLMs的开放回答评估政治观点，但存在回答与内部意图不一致的问题，且单轴分析易导致概念混淆。

Method: 设计四维政治学习框架，构建数据集用于细粒度政治概念向量学习，并在八个开源LLMs上应用三种表示工程技术进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，向量能解耦政治概念混淆，检测任务验证其语义意义，干预实验可生成不同政治倾向的回答。

Conclusion: 多维度框架和表示工程技术能有效揭示和干预LLMs的政治观点，具有泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Result: 总结了当前多模态集成技术的发展模式，为未来模型提供指导。

Conclusion: 该分类框架为研究者提供了当前多模态集成技术的结构化概述，有助于未来更稳健的模型开发。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

TL;DR: FineLogic是一个细粒度的评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在逻辑推理中的表现，涵盖准确性、步骤合理性和表示对齐三个维度。研究发现，自然语言监督具有更好的泛化能力，而符号监督则能生成更结构化的推理链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注最终答案准确性，无法全面评估逻辑推理的质量和结构，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架，评估逻辑推理的三个维度，并研究四种监督格式（一种自然语言和三种符号变体）对模型推理能力的影响。

Result: 自然语言监督在泛化任务中表现更好，而符号监督能生成更结构化和原子化的推理链。微调主要通过逐步生成改进推理行为。

Conclusion: FineLogic为评估和改进大语言模型的逻辑推理能力提供了更严谨和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密码填字游戏线索是一种复杂的语言任务，现有方法难以高效解决。论文旨在开发一种可解释且高性能的系统来解决这一挑战。

Method: 系统结合了LLM和开源组件，通过三步流程（假设答案、提出字谜解释、验证推理步骤）解决线索，并使用Python代码表达解决方案。

Result: 该系统在Cryptonite数据集上达到了最新性能，且解决方案的解释性高。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLM在复杂语言任务中的潜力，并为密码填字游戏提供了一种可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成MCQs耗时耗力，LLMs可能提供高效解决方案。

Method: 通过向LLMs注入知识而非依赖其固有知识，对比三种模型生成MCQs的效果，并由21名教育工作者评估。

Result: GPT-3.5在生成MCQs方面表现最优，但教育领域对AI的接受度仍有待提高。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成MCQs方面具有潜力，可为教育体验带来改进。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps是一个新基准，通过将ListOps计算转化为长故事，测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的状态管理能力，揭示其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的能力，缺乏真实干扰或未能分离上下文长度与推理复杂度。

Method: 通过编程将ListOps计算转化为长故事，强制LLMs进行内部计算和状态管理，同时控制叙事长度和推理难度。

Result: 领先的LLMs（如OpenAI o4、Gemini 2.5 Pro）在Verbose ListOps上表现不佳，尽管能轻松解决原始ListOps问题。

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps揭示了LLMs在嵌套推理中的关键弱点，为改进推理能力提供了方向，而不仅仅是扩展上下文窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在英语教学中表现出色，但其在其他语言（尤其是数学推理任务）中的教学能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过模拟多语言师生互动，使用强模型作为导师生成提示，弱模型模拟学生，评估语言特定反馈的效果。

Result: 多语言提示显著提升学习效果，尤其在学生母语与反馈语言一致的低资源语言中。

Conclusion: 研究为开发多语言、基于LLM的教育工具提供了实用见解，强调反馈语言与学生母语一致的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Motivation: 研究LLMs的自我报告行为是否可被视为内省，以探讨其与人类内省行为的异同。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的两个具体自我报告案例，评估其是否符合内省的定义。

Result: 第一个案例（LLM描述其“创造性”写作过程）不符合内省；第二个案例（LLM推断自身温度参数值）勉强符合内省定义，但无意识体验。

Conclusion: LLMs的某些行为可能勉强符合内省，但其缺乏意识，与人类内省有本质区别。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

TL;DR: DiCoRe框架通过发散-收敛推理（Dreamer和Grounder）提升零样本事件检测性能，结合LLM-Judge验证，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本事件检测中复杂事件本体和领域特定触发词提取的挑战，提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在该任务中的实用性。

Method: 提出DiCoRe框架，包含Dreamer（发散推理）和Grounder（收敛推理），并通过LLM-Judge验证输出。

Result: 在六个数据集上实验，DiCoRe平均F1分数比最佳基线高4-7%。

Conclusion: DiCoRe是一种强大的零样本事件检测框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Conclusion: 研究结果为听觉属性处理提供了新见解，并为未来改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统过于依赖检索上下文，可能忽视模型固有知识，尤其是在处理误导性或冗余信息时。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，采用联合采样和多策略分布探索知识能力，促进模型对参数化知识和上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1在参数与上下文冲突任务及一般RAG任务中显著提升鲁棒性和推理准确性，尤其在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效解决了RAG中知识使用不平衡的问题，并在多种任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）因训练数据而表现出社会、人口和性别偏见，研究旨在揭示这些偏见在模型中的结构表征。

Method: 通过机制解释性方法，分析模型内部边缘的偏见行为，评估其稳定性、定位性和泛化性，并进行系统性消融实验。

Result: 偏见计算集中在少数层，且随微调设置变化；移除偏见组件会减少偏见输出，但影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 偏见在模型中高度局部化，移除偏见组件可能对其他任务产生副作用，需谨慎处理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

TL;DR: ECoRAG框架通过基于证据性压缩检索文档，提升LLM在开放域问答任务中的性能，同时降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法未过滤非证据信息，限制了LLM在RAG中的表现。

Method: 提出ECoRAG框架，基于证据性压缩文档，并在证据不足时继续检索。

Result: 实验显示ECoRAG在ODQA任务中优于现有压缩方法，且更高效。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过保留必要信息提升性能并降低成本，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在不更新参数的情况下进行反事实推理，即预测假设场景下的变化后果。

Method: 采用线性回归任务作为合成实验，要求模型推断并复制上下文噪声以实现准确预测。

Result: 研究发现语言模型在受控环境中能进行反事实推理，且自注意力、模型深度和预训练数据多样性是关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，Transformer模型在序列数据上也能进行噪声推断，为反事实故事生成提供了初步证据。

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督方法GEM，使大型解码器语言模型（LLM）能生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保留原有文本生成和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有应用中依赖独立嵌入模型导致的系统复杂性和理解不一致问题。

Method: 通过插入特殊标记并操纵注意力掩码生成文本的总结嵌入，可轻松集成到现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在MTEB文本嵌入基准上显著提升性能，同时对MMLU NLP基准影响极小。

Conclusion: GEM方法为LLM提供了先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持了其原有的NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始视频生成音频-视觉语音识别（AVSR）数据集的实用方法，并展示了其在越南语上的应用，显著提升了在噪声环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别系统仅依赖音频特征，在噪声环境下表现不佳。AVSR因其鲁棒性受到关注，但多语言数据集稀缺限制了其发展。

Method: 通过改进现有技术，从原始视频中高效生成AVSR数据集，并开发了一个越南语基线模型。

Result: 自动收集的数据集支持了强基线模型，在干净环境下表现与ASR相当，在噪声环境下显著优于ASR。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR至更多语言（尤其是资源匮乏语言）提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中外部检索知识与LLM内部知识冲突影响性能，现有方法因上下文冗长而效果不佳。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架，通过分层动作空间自适应分解知识源，进行细粒度比较。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上，Micro-Act显著提升QA准确性，尤其在时间和语义冲突类型中表现突出。

Conclusion: Micro-Act在解决知识冲突的同时保持非冲突问题的鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 现有HTC模型分别处理标签层次结构或文本编码，未能充分利用两者的互补性。

Method: 提出HTC-CLIP，通过对比学习同时学习层次感知的文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，并在推理时结合两者的概率分布。

Result: 在两个公共基准数据集上，HTC-CLIP的Macro F1分数比现有最优模型提高了0.99-2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP有效结合了两种方法的优势，显著提升了分层文本分类的性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 解决跨领域数据不足的问题，构建一个在少量标注下能泛化到不同领域（渠道、地理、语言）的意图分类器。

Method: 采用监督微调方法结合各向同性正则化训练领域特定嵌入器，并通过多语言知识蒸馏策略实现跨领域泛化。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥的电商客户服务数据集上，少样本意图检测准确率比现有SOTA模型提高20-23%。

Conclusion: 提出的模型架构在跨领域意图分类任务中表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Conclusion: ProRefine不仅提高了准确性，还使小模型能媲美大模型性能，具有高效、可扩展和普及高性能AI的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM遗忘方法，通过约束优化问题实现敏感信息的遗忘，同时保留有用数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的LLM需要遗忘敏感、过时或专有信息，但现有方法在遗忘和保留之间难以平衡，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用约束优化问题，使用对数边际平坦化损失强制遗忘，并通过硬约束保留有用数据。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，有效移除目标信息并保留下游性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、稳定的LLM遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了两种流行的水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对大型语言模型（LLMs）在真实性、安全性和帮助性上的影响，并提出了一种名为Alignment Resampling（AR）的推理时采样方法以恢复模型对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印技术可能影响LLMs的输出质量，但其对模型核心对齐属性（真实性、安全性和帮助性）的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过实验分析两种水印方法的影响，并提出AR方法，利用外部奖励模型在推理时恢复对齐性。

Result: 实验表明，AR方法仅需采样2-4个水印生成结果即可恢复或超越基线对齐分数，同时保持水印可检测性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了水印强度与模型对齐之间的关键平衡，并提供了一种简单的推理时解决方案，以负责任地部署水印LLMs。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Motivation: 探讨社区街道商业活力的驱动因素，尤其是车辆可达性、环境质量和行人感知的复杂交互作用。

Method: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并通过GPT-4的感知建模分析其与空间特征的关系。

Result: 适度车辆存在提升商业活力，但过度停车（尤其在窄街道）降低步行性和满意度；绿化和清洁度显著提升满意度，但对定价影响较弱；街道宽度调节车辆影响。

Conclusion: 研究证明了AI辅助感知与城市形态分析结合的价值，为社区振兴提供了理论和工具支持，强调了车辆活动在商业中的条件性作用。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Motivation: 解决预训练中高质量数据不足的问题，探索如何利用被过滤的低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量文档生成合成数据，并与高质量原始数据混合使用。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合数据比仅使用过滤数据提升1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 改写低质量数据是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要复杂模型改动，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性，因此需要一种简单且通用的长度控制方法。

Method: 通过增加EOS令牌在交叉熵损失计算中的重要性来控制生成文本长度，方法独立于架构和解码算法。

Result: 在编码器-解码器和GPT风格LLM上测试，该方法能有效控制生成长度且通常不影响摘要质量。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、通用，适用于多种模型，且不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

TL;DR: Search Arena是一个大规模、多轮对话的人类偏好数据集，用于分析搜索增强语言模型的用户偏好，发现用户偏好受引用数量影响，且不同来源的偏好差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集规模小、范围窄，难以全面分析搜索增强语言模型的性能，因此需要更大规模、多样化的数据集。

Method: 通过众包收集24,000多对多轮用户交互数据，包含12,000个人类偏好投票，分析用户偏好及系统表现。

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量影响，且不同来源的偏好差异显著；搜索增强模型在非搜索环境中表现良好，但在搜索环境中依赖参数知识会显著降低质量。

Conclusion: 搜索增强语言模型的用户偏好与引用行为相关，需进一步研究；数据集开源以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial
intelligence and financial researchers.

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.
