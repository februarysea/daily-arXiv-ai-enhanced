The\ndependent variable is the hourly waiting count in the ED. Seven regression\nmodels were developed to assess the effects of different predictors such as\nweather conditions, hospital census, federal holidays, and football games\nacross different timestamps.\n  Results: Some weather conditions significantly increased ED crowding in the\nBaseline Model, while federal holidays and weekends consistently reduced\nwaiting counts. Boarding count positively correlated with ED crowding when they\nare concurrent, but earlier boarding count (3-6 hours before) showed\nsignificant negative associations, reducing subsequent waiting counts. Hospital\ncensus exhibited a negative association in the Baseline Model but shifted to a\npositive effect in other models, reflecting its time-dependent influence on ED\noperations. Football games 12 hours before significantly increased waiting\ncounts, while games 12 and 24 hours after had no significant effects.\n  Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of incorporating both\noperational and non-operational factors (e.g., weather) to understand ED\npatient flow.

In order\nto scientifically predict the enterprises' coping behaviors and performance\noutcomes under the policy impact, this paper constructs a methodological\nframework that integrates the AI synthetic data generation mechanism and\nstructural path regression modeling to simulate the enterprises' strategic\ntransition paths under the new regulations. In terms of research methodology,\nthis paper adopts high-quality simulation data generated based on Monte Carlo\nmechanism and NIST synthetic data standards to construct a structural path\nanalysis model that includes multiple linear regression, logistic regression,\nmediation effect and moderating effect. The variable system covers 14\nindicators such as enterprise working hours, compliance investment, response\nspeed, automation level, policy dependence, etc. The variable set with\nexplanatory power is screened out through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and\nVIF multicollinearity elimination. The findings show that compliance investment\nhas a significant positive impact on firm survival and its effect is\ntransmitted through the mediating path of the level of intelligence; meanwhile,\nfirms' dependence on the EU market significantly moderates the strength of this\nmediating effect. It is concluded that AI synthetic data combined with\nstructural path modeling provides an effective tool for high-intensity\nregulatory simulation, which can provide a quantitative basis for corporate\nstrategic response, policy design and AI-assisted decision-making in the\npre-prediction stage lacking real scenario data.

The review identified key limitations in existing EA\nframeworks, particularly their inability to fully address the unique\nrequirements of GenAI. The interviews, analysed using the Gioia methodology,\nrevealed critical enablers and barriers to GenAI adoption across industries.\nThe findings indicate that EAM, when theorised as sensing, seizing and\ntransforming dynamic capabilities, can enhance GenAI adoption by improving\nstrategic alignment, governance frameworks and organisational agility.

Recent deep learning\nmodels, including Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, have shown promising\nresults in brain tumor image identification but still face limitations in\nhandling uncertainty and generalizing across diverse medical conditions.\nTraditional KD methods often rely on a context-unaware temperature parameter to\nsoften teacher model predictions, which does not adapt effectively to varying\nuncertainty levels present in medical images. To address this issue, we propose\na novel framework that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal\nteacher-student model selection and a novel context-aware predictor approach\nfor temperature scaling. The proposed context-aware framework adjusts the\ntemperature based on factors such as image quality, disease complexity, and\nteacher model confidence, allowing for more robust knowledge transfer.\nAdditionally, ACO efficiently selects the most appropriate teacher-student\nmodel pair from a set of pre-trained models, outperforming current optimization\nmethods by exploring a broader solution space and better handling complex,\nnon-linear relationships within the data. The proposed framework is evaluated\nusing three publicly available benchmark datasets, each corresponding to a\ndistinct medical imaging task. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nframework significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving\ntop accuracy rates: 98.01% on the MRI brain tumor (Kaggle) dataset, 92.81% on\nthe Figshare MRI dataset, and 96.20% on the GastroNet dataset.

To investigate this, we systematically\nevaluate audio, visual, and audio-visual LLMs, specifically Qwen2-Audio,\nQwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-Omni, against humans in recognizing sound objects of\ndifferent classes from audio-only, silent video, or sounded video inputs. We\nuncover a performance gap between Qwen2-Audio and Qwen2-VL that parallels the\nsensory discrepancy between human ears and eyes.

We focused on data\ncapturing psychometric scores of social maladjustment, internalizing behaviors,\nand neurodevelopmental risk, assessed in 232 adolescents from the Healthy Brain\nNetwork. This dataset included structured interviews in which adolescents\ndiscussed a common emotion-inducing topic. To model conceptual associations\nwithin these interviews, we applied textual forma mentis networks (TFMNs)-a\ncognitive/AI approach integrating syntactic, semantic, and emotional word-word\nassociations in language. From TFMNs, we extracted network features\n(semantic/syntactic structure) and emotional profiles to serve as predictors of\nlatent psychopathology factor scores. Using Random Forest and XGBoost\nregression models, we found significant associations between language-derived\nfeatures and clinical scores: social maladjustment (r = 0.37, p < .01),\nspecific internalizing behaviors (r = 0.33, p < .05), and neurodevelopmental\nrisk (r = 0.34, p < .05). Explainable AI analysis using SHAP values revealed\nthat higher modularity and a pronounced core-periphery network\nstructure-reflecting clustered conceptual organization in language-predicted\nincreased social maladjustment. Internalizing scores were positively associated\nwith higher betweenness centrality and stronger expressions of disgust,\nsuggesting a linguistic signature of rumination. In contrast,\nneurodevelopmental risk was inversely related to local efficiency in\nsyntactic/semantic networks, indicating disrupted conceptual integration.

We describe the dataset composition (from marine mammal calls\nto soundscapes and complex real-world clips), the evaluation protocol (top-1\naccuracy with answer-shuffling robustness), and baseline systems\n(Qwen2-Audio-7B, AudioFlamingo 2, Gemini-2-Flash). Preliminary results on the\ndevelopment set are compared, showing strong variation across models and\nsubsets.

However,\nexisting studies have relied on private datasets and simplistic degradation\nmodels. To address this gap, we introduce UFPR-SR-Plates, a novel dataset\ncontaining 10,000 tracks with 100,000 paired low and high-resolution license\nplate images captured under real-world conditions. We establish a benchmark\nusing multiple sequential LR and high-resolution (HR) images per vehicle --\nfive of each -- and two state-of-the-art models for super-resolution of license\nplates. We also investigate three fusion strategies to evaluate how combining\npredictions from a leading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for\nmultiple super-resolved license plates enhances overall performance. Our\nfindings demonstrate that super-resolution significantly boosts LPR\nperformance, with further improvements observed when applying majority\nvote-based fusion techniques. Specifically, the Layout-Aware and\nCharacter-Driven Network (LCDNet) model combined with the Majority Vote by\nCharacter Position (MVCP) strategy led to the highest recognition rates,\nincreasing from 1.7% with low-resolution images to 31.1% with super-resolution,\nand up to 44.7% when combining OCR outputs from five super-resolved images.\nThese findings underscore the critical role of super-resolution and temporal\ninformation in enhancing LPR accuracy under real-world, adverse conditions.

Extended version of an accepted IJCAI 2025 paper", "summary": "Traditional logic-based belief revision research focuses on designing rules\nto constrain the behavior of revision operators. Frameworks have been proposed\nto characterize iterated revision rules, but they are often too loose, leading\nto multiple revision operators that all satisfy the rules under the same belief\ncondition. In many practical applications, such as safety critical ones, it is\nimportant to specify a definite revision operator to enable agents to\niteratively revise their beliefs in a deterministic way. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework for iterated belief revision by characterizing belief\ninformation through preference relations. Semantically, both beliefs and new\nevidence are represented as belief algebras, which provide a rich and\nexpressive foundation for belief revision. Building on traditional revision\nrules, we introduce additional postulates for revision with belief algebra,\nincluding an upper-bound constraint on the outcomes of revision.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up\nthe possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly\ntranslated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate\ntask-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle.\nThese sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors\nbefore a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch\nand adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating\nCadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs\nto produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this\nPython-based scripting language.

The framework incorporates three\nmajor innovations: (1) de-noising parliamentary speeches via summarization to\nproduce cleaner, more consistent opinion embeddings; (2) automatic extraction\nof axes of political controversy from legislators' speech summaries; and (3) a\ndiachronic analysis that tracks the evolution of party positions over time.\n  We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to verify our\nmethodology.

We therefore aim to investigate the\nGreen AI perception and management of industry practitioners. To this end, we\nconducted a total of 11 interviews with participants from 10 different\norganizations that adopted AI-based software. The interviews explored three\nmain themes: AI adoption, current efforts in mitigating the negative\nenvironmental impact of AI, and the influence of the EU AI Act and the\nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Our findings indicate that\n9 of 11 participants prioritized business efficiency during AI adoption, with\nminimal consideration of environmental sustainability. Monitoring and\nmitigation of AI's environmental impact were very limited. Only one participant\nmonitored negative environmental effects. Regarding applied mitigation\npractices, six participants reported no actions, with the others sporadically\nmentioning techniques like prompt engineering, relying on smaller models, or\nnot overusing AI. Awareness and compliance with the EU AI Act are low, with\nonly one participant reporting on its influence, while the CSRD drove\nsustainability reporting efforts primarily in larger companies.

To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modal\nAlignment (HCMA) framework for grounded text-to-image generation. HCMA\nintegrates two alignment modules into each diffusion sampling step: a global\nmodule that continuously aligns latent representations with textual\ndescriptions to ensure scene-level coherence, and a local module that employs\nbounding-box layouts to anchor objects at specified locations, enabling\nfine-grained spatial control. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO 2014\nvalidation set show that HCMA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a\n0.69 improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and a 0.0295 gain in CLIP\nScore.

To address the generalization issues, we\naim to propose a method that can calibrate prompts to eliminate confounders for\naccurate OVMS. Building upon the causal analysis, we propose that the optimal\nprompt for OVMS should contain only task-relevant causal factors. We define it\nas the causal prompt, serving as the goal of calibration. Next, our theoretical\nanalysis, grounded by causal multi-distribution consistency theory, proves that\nthis prompt can be obtained by enforcing segmentation consistency and\noptimality. Inspired by this, we propose CPC-SAM, a Causal Prompt Calibration\nmethod for SAM to achieve accurate OVMS. It integrates a lightweight causal\nprompt learner (CaPL) into SAM to obtain causal prompts. Specifically, we first\ngenerate multiple prompts using random annotations to simulate diverse\ndistributions and then reweight them via CaPL by enforcing causal\nmulti-distribution consistency in both task and entity levels.

Yet, traffic\nsensors measuring traffic volume are typically scarcely located, due to their\nhigh deployment and maintenance costs. To address this, interpolation methods\ncan estimate traffic volumes at unobserved locations using available data.\nGraph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume\nforecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying\nthem to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks\nexhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed\nwith many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains\nunclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph\nNeural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume\nestimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation,\nintegrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function\ntailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions.

For an\nanchor sample, most existing approaches generate negative samples either from\nother videos or within the same video for contrastive learning. However, some\ntraining samples are highly similar to the anchor sample, directly regarding\nthem as negative samples leads to difficulties for optimization and ignores the\ncorrelations between these similar samples and the anchor sample. To address\nthis, we propose Positive Sample Mining (PSM), a novel framework that mines\npositive samples from the training set to provide more discriminative\nsupervision.

This paper use\nprovision afforded by Ewii as a case for exploring how householders organize\nthemselves to use a technological artefact that supports the monitoring of\nenergy and its related usage. This study aims to inform technology design\nthrough the derivation of four personas. The derived personas highlight the\ndifferences in energy monitoring practices for the householders and their\nengagement. These personas are characterised as dedicated, organised, sporadic,\nand convenient. Understanding these differences in energy monitoring practice\nusing the technological artefact form a solid element in the design of future\nenergy technologies that interfere with the everyday practices and energy\nconsumption for households. This is paramount for future energy related\ntechnology design, and for the clarification of usage assumptions that are\nembedded in the rollout of energy related technology as a country such as\nDenmark moves through its green transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e39\u9ea6Ewii\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u80fd\u6e90\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u751f\u4ea7\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f7f\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e2e\u52a9\u5bb6\u5ead\u8c03\u6574\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u4e39\u9ea6Ewii\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u80fd\u6e90\u76d1\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\uff1a\u4e13\u6ce8\u578b\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u578b\u3001\u5076\u5c14\u578b\u548c\u4fbf\u5229\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u76d1\u6d4b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u80fd\u6e90\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5e72\u9884\u5bb6\u5ead\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

Optimizing task allocation among these diverse\nagents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios\ncharacterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial\nobservability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity\nCollaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for\nemergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel\n``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs,\nalongside performing their sensing tasks.

Traditional fault detection methods\noften struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient\nperformance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing\nnonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow\nconvergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using\ngradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method\ncombining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the\nGrasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our\napproach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional\ndataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these\nvalues is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is\nachieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving\ncritical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN\nwhere GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's\nlimitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN\nframework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by\nGOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The\ndataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the\nUniversity of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's\nperformance.

CAD\nfaces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and segmentation of small\nanomalous regions. Existing CAD methods store image distributions or patch\nfeatures to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but they fail to preserve\npixel-level detailed features for accurate segmentation. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose ReplayCAD, a novel diffusion-driven generative replay\nframework that replay high-quality historical data, thus effectively preserving\npixel-level detailed features. Specifically, we compress historical data by\nsearching for a class semantic embedding in the conditional space of the\npre-trained diffusion model, which can guide the model to replay data with\nfine-grained pixel details, thus improving the segmentation performance.\nHowever, relying solely on semantic features results in limited spatial\ndiversity. Hence, we further use spatial features to guide data compression,\nachieving precise control of sample space, thereby generating more diverse\ndata.

We unfold the iterative optimized\nsolution of this model into a multistage network, with each stage comprising a\nreflectance-assisted illumination correction (RAIC) module and an\nillumination-guided reflectance enhancement (IGRE) module. RAIC employs a\nvisual state space (VSS) to extract non-local features, enforcing illumination\nsmoothness, while IGRE introduces a frequency-aware VSS to globally align\nsimilar textures, enabling mildly degraded regions to guide the enhancement of\ndetails in more severely degraded areas. This suppresses noise while enhancing\ndetails. Furthermore, given the multistage structure, we propose an inter-stage\ninformation consistent loss to maintain network stability in the final stages.\nThis loss contributes to structural preservation and sustains the model's\nperformance even in unsupervised settings.

However, applying\nsimilar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to\ntheir lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention\nmechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by\nintroducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This\nlinear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a\ndisentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for\nhigh-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a\ncombination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive\nloss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M\nalgorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method\nachieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while\nenabling symbolic reasoning.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named\nHALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring\nthe half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three\nmodules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder\nmodule, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact\nattention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to\nidentify relevant facts.

However, recent\nstudies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit\nexcessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking problem stems\nfrom conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning's systematic neglect in\nregulating intermediate reasoning steps. This paper proposes Serial-Group\nDecaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement\nlearning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the\nsufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT\ngeneration. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible\ncompletions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions\nin the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead\ngenerate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a\nserial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower\nrewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to\ngenerate higher-quality answers at earlier phases with earlier exits of\nthinking.

Conventional digital elevation models\n(DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain\ncostly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data\nand refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE,\nyet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they\ntruly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained\npurely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height\npredictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily\non shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of\nheights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent\ndifficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores\nadditional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global\nLiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local\naccuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections.

However, existing\nintelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models,\nsuffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and\ngeneralization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments.\nTo address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation\nmodel, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management.\nSpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically\nexploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention\nmechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation\nlearning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning\ntasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which\nleverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive\nand transferable spectrum representations.

Motivated by the\nobservation that high-frequency regions (e.g., edges and textures) are most\ncritical for reconstruction, we propose a training-free adaptive masking module\nfor acceleration that dynamically focuses computation on these challenging\nareas. Specifically, our method first extracts high-frequency components via\nGaussian blur subtraction and adaptively generates binary masks using K-means\nclustering to identify regions requiring intensive processing.

We propose a dual-layered\ndistillation strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation, transferring semantic\nand structural insights from a teacher to a compact student model while\nminimizing quality degradation. Additionally, replay-based continual learning\nis integrated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, allowing the model to retain\nprior knowledge while adapting to new data. Despite operating under extremely\nlow computational resources, KDC-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe Oxford Flowers and Butterflies & Moths 100 Species datasets, demonstrating\ncompetitive metrics such as FID, CLIP, and LPIPS. Moreover, it significantly\nreduces inference time compared to existing models. These results establish\nKDC-Diff as a highly efficient and adaptable solution for text-to-image\ngeneration, particularly in computationally constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "KDC-Diff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u7684U-Net\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u534a\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u91cd\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\uff0cKDC-Diff\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "KDC-Diff\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To facilitate VLM\nresearch on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we\ncurate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created\nusing a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2\nimages are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or\nincorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review\nthese reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure\nhigh-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that\ncontain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying\nhallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach\nto reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale,\nproblem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our\ndataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports,\nwe finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call\nhallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better\nthan simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we\nconduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several\nmetrics, establishing a benchmark.

While introducing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmethods has alleviated this issue to some extent, it also significantly\nincreases the number of parameters required for fine-tuning and training time,\nintroducing greater parameter redundancy. To address these challenges, we\npropose a method for allocating expert numbers based on parameter sensitivity\nLoRA-SMoE (A Sensitivity-Driven Expert Allocation Method in LoRA-MoE for\nEfficient Fine-Tuning). This method rapidly assesses the sensitivity of\ndifferent tasks to parameters by sampling a small amount of data and using\ngradient information. It then adaptively allocates expert numbers within a\ngiven budget. The process maintains comparable memory consumption to LoRA\n(Low-Rank Adaptation) while ensuring an efficient and resource-friendly\nfine-tuning procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to SOTA\nfine-tuning methods, our LoRA-SMoE approach can enhance model performance while\nreducing the number of trainable parameters. This significantly improves model\nperformance in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, due to its\nefficient parameter sensitivity evaluation mechanism, LoRA-SMoE requires\nminimal computational overhead to optimize expert allocation, making it\nparticularly suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources.

However, current automatic micro-expression\nrecognition (MER) research primarily focuses on discrete emotion\nclassification, neglecting a convincing analysis of the subtle dynamic\nmovements and inherent emotional cues. The rapid progress in multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs), known for their strong multimodal comprehension and\nlanguage generation abilities, offers new possibilities. MLLMs have shown\nsuccess in various vision-language tasks, indicating their potential to\nunderstand MEs comprehensively, including both fine-grained motion patterns and\nunderlying emotional semantics. Nevertheless, challenges remain due to the\nsubtle intensity and short duration of MEs, as existing MLLMs are not designed\nto capture such delicate frame-level facial dynamics. In this paper, we propose\na novel Micro-Expression Large Language Model (MELLM), which incorporates a\nsubtle facial motion perception strategy with the strong inference capabilities\nof MLLMs, representing the first exploration of MLLMs in the domain of ME\nanalysis. Specifically, to explicitly guide the MLLM toward motion-sensitive\nregions, we construct an interpretable motion-enhanced color map by fusing\nonset-apex optical flow dynamics with the corresponding grayscale onset frame\nas the model input.

Additionally,\nPARM enables weak-to-strong guidance, allowing a smaller PARM to guide a larger\nfrozen LLM without expensive training, making multi-objective alignment\naccessible with limited computing resources.

Furthermore, many of\nthese approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as\nImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target\nCOntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware\nvision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for\nagricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf\nimages and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000\nimage-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic\npretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence\nin contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model\ngeneralization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing\nvision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across\nseveral benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text\nretrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter\nfootprint.

Recent advancements have introduced deterministic\nsampling processes that reduce inference from 15 iterative steps to a single\nstep, thereby significantly improving the inference speed of existing diffusion\nmodels. However, their efficiency remains limited when handling complex\nsemantic regions due to the single-step inference. To address this limitation,\nwe propose SAMSR, a semantic-guided diffusion framework that incorporates\nsemantic segmentation masks into the sampling process. Specifically, we\nintroduce the SAM-Noise Module, which refines Gaussian noise using segmentation\nmasks to preserve spatial and semantic features. Furthermore, we develop a\npixel-wise sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the residual transfer\nrate and noise strength based on pixel-level semantic weights, prioritizing\nsemantically rich regions during the diffusion process. To enhance model\ntraining, we also propose a semantic consistency loss, which aligns pixel-wise\nsemantic weights between predictions and ground truth. Extensive experiments on\nboth real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SAMSR significantly\nimproves perceptual quality and detail recovery, particularly in semantically\ncomplex images.

Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT\nsecurity vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT\nenvironments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to\nautomatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities\nremains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant\ndriven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of\nIoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we\npropose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the\nvarious dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses\ntailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating\nICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios,\nresulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations\nand solutions.

Our model aims to fully exploit the\nanatomical features of the intra-pancreatic and extra-pancreatic regions, and\nhence enhance the characterization of the high-uncertainty regions for more\nrobust generalization. Specifically, we first construct a global-feature\ncontrastive self-supervised learning module that is guided by the pancreatic\nspatial structure. This module obtains complete and consistent pancreatic\nfeatures through promoting intra-class cohesion, and also extracts more\ndiscriminative features for differentiating between pancreatic and\nnon-pancreatic tissues through maximizing inter-class separation. It mitigates\nthe influence of surrounding tissue on the segmentation outcomes in\nhigh-uncertainty regions.

This evolution enables unprecedented levels\nof AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems\nand users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write\nand execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to\nautonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without\nhuman oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.\n  This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI\nsystems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI\nagents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks\nwithin specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to\nsystematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and\nAI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures\nused to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams\nto: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across\ntechnical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI\ncomponents without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3)\nholistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific\nproduct context.

This work introduces a novel\nformulation of the Kalman filter that incorporates motion dynamics, allowing\nthe motion model to adaptively adjust according to changes in the object's\nmovement. The proposed Kalman filter substantially improves state estimation,\nlocalization, and trajectory prediction compared to the traditional Kalman\nfilter. This is reflected in tracking performance that surpasses recent\nbenchmarks on the KITTI and Waymo Open Datasets, with margins of 0.56\\% and\n0.81\\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and multi-object tracking\naccuracy (MOTA), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter\nconsistently outperforms the baseline across various detectors. Additionally,\nit shows an enhanced capability in managing long occlusions compared to the\nbaseline Kalman filter, achieving margins of 1.22\\% in higher order tracking\naccuracy (HOTA) and 1.55\\% in multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) on the\nKITTI dataset. The formulation's efficiency is evident, with an additional\nprocessing time of only approximately 0.078 ms per frame, ensuring its\napplicability in real-time applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u57283D\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u548cWaymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cHOTA\u548cMOTA\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53470.56%\u548c0.81%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u906e\u6321\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We\nevaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal\ndataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our\npreprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines.\nThe results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses\ntransfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time\nseries and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly\nprediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \\noindent The\ndatasets, codes to reproduce the results, supplementary materials, and demo are\navailable at https://github.com/ChathurangiShyalika/NSF-MAP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u88c5\u914d\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u51b3\u7b56\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u88c5\u914d\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5f02\u5e38\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods primarily rely on fixed tone\nmapping operators, which are inadequate for handling SDR inputs with diverse\nstyles commonly found in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we\npropose a generalized SDR-to-HDR method that handles diverse styles in\nreal-world SDR content, termed Realistic Style Disentangled Representation\nLearning (RealRep). By disentangling luminance and chrominance, we analyze the\nintrinsic differences between contents with varying styles and propose a\ndisentangled multi-view style representation learning method. This approach\ncaptures the guidance prior of true luminance and chrominance distributions\nacross different styles, even when the SDR style distributions exhibit\nsignificant variations, thereby establishing a robust embedding space for\ninverse tone mapping. Motivated by the difficulty of directly utilizing\ndegradation representation priors, we further introduce the Degradation-Domain\nAware Controlled Mapping Network (DDACMNet), a two-stage framework that\nperforms adaptive hierarchical mapping guided by a control-aware normalization\nmechanism. DDACMNet dynamically modulates the mapping process via\ndegradation-conditioned hierarchical features, enabling robust adaptation\nacross diverse degradation domains.

We\nthen highlight results from the latest iteration of the benchmark, including\nenergy measurements of 40 widely used model architectures across 6 different\ntasks, case studies of how ML design choices impact energy consumption, and how\nautomated optimization recommendations can lead to significant (sometimes more\nthan 40%) energy savings without changing what is being computed by the model.\nThe ML.ENERGY Benchmark is open-source and can be easily extended to various\ncustomized models and application scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ML.ENERGY Benchmark\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u670d\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u5728ML\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u6216\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ML.ENERGY Benchmark\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u670d\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8640\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u57286\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ML.ENERGY Benchmark\u5f00\u6e90\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Right heart catheterization (RHC), the gold standard for precise\nevaluation, is invasive and unsuitable for routine use, limiting its\npracticality for timely diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary hypertension\nprogression. Here, we propose MePH, a multi-view, multi-modal vision-language\nmodel to accurately assess pulmonary hypertension progression using\nnon-invasive echocardiography. We constructed a large dataset comprising paired\nstandardized echocardiogram videos, spectral images and RHC data, covering\n1,237 patient cases from 12 medical centers. For the first time, MePH precisely\nmodels the correlation between non-invasive multi-view, multi-modal\nechocardiography and the pressure and resistance obtained via RHC. We show that\nMePH significantly outperforms echocardiographers' assessments using\nechocardiography, reducing the mean absolute error in estimating mean pulmonary\narterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 49.73% and\n43.81%, respectively. In eight independent external hospitals, MePH achieved a\nmean absolute error of 3.147 for PVR assessment. Furthermore, MePH achieved an\narea under the curve of 0.921, surpassing echocardiographers (area under the\ncurve of 0.842) in accurately predicting the severity of pulmonary\nhypertension, whether mild or severe.

Traditional communication methods based on Shannon's theory are\nfacing optimization bottlenecks. Semantic communication, as an emerging\ncommunication method, is expected to break through this bottleneck and reduce\nthe storage and transmission consumption of video. Existing semantic decoding\nmethods often require many samples to train the neural network for each scene,\nwhich is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a semantic encoding\nand decoding method for surveillance video is proposed. First, the sketch was\nextracted as semantic information, and a sketch compression method was proposed\nto reduce the bit rate of semantic information. Then, an image translation\nnetwork was proposed to translate the sketch into a video frame with a\nreference frame. Finally, a few-shot sketch decoding network was proposed to\nreconstruct video from sketch.

Hence, an efficient navigation plan is essential for the final\nsuccess. This paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient action planner using\nlarge language models (PEAP-LLM) to generate a single-step instruction at each\nlocation. The proposed model consists of two modules, LLM goal planner (LGP)\nand LoRA action planner (LAP). Initially, LGP extracts the goal-oriented plan\nfrom REVERIE instructions, including the target object and room. Then, LAP\ngenerates a single-step instruction with the goal-oriented plan, high-level\ninstruction, and current visual observation as input. PEAP-LLM enables the\nembodied agent to interact with LAP as the path planner on the fly. A simple\ndirect application of LLMs hardly achieves good performance. Also, existing\nhard-prompt-based methods are error-prone in complicated scenarios and need\nhuman intervention.

Their\nplug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with\nthese models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated\ninto various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are\ngrowing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts\n(e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack),\nwhile the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work\nbridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack\nvector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons\nsystem prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and\nmodel responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies\nin various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and\nreasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without\nrequiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks,\nincluding those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language\nprocessing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective\neven when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like\nchain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and\nretrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for\nimproving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened\nin their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6bd2\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6c61\u67d3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u6301\u7eed\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u6709\u540e\u7eed\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u5404\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u578bLLMs\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u751f\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6bd2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u8d77\u91cd\u89c6\u5e76\u91c7\u53d6\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior --\nmirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the\nreverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok\nfundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key\nways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion\nand AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok\ntokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture\n-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training\nobjectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman\nequation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports\nreinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable\nto that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA\ntokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality\nreconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for\nboth visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any\ntext-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual\ntokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all\nthe existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok\neffectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot\nsupport effective RL.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UnifyGeo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in\nboth task-isolated and task-associated settings. Remarkably, on the challenging\nVIGOR benchmark, which supports fine-grained localization evaluation, the\n1-meter-level localization recall rate improves from 1.53\\% to 39.64\\% and from\n0.43\\% to 25.58\\% under same-area and cross-area evaluations, respectively.\nCode will be made publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "UnifyGeo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728VIGOR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c1\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece1.53%\u63d0\u5347\u81f339.64%\uff08\u540c\u533a\u57df\uff09\u548c\u4ece0.43%\u63d0\u5347\u81f325.58%\uff08\u8de8\u533a\u57df\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "UnifyGeo\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Intuitively, the importance of sentiment\nclassification tasks is the same in all domains for multi-domain sentiment\nclassification; but domain classification tasks are different because the\nimpact of domain information on sentiment classification varies across\ndifferent fields; this can be controlled through adjustable weights or hyper\nparameters. However, as the number of domains increases, existing\nhyperparameter optimization algorithms may face the following challenges: (1)\ntremendous demand for computing resources, (2) convergence problems, and (3)\nhigh algorithm complexity. To efficiently generate the domain information\nrequired for sentiment classification in each domain, we propose a dynamic\ninformation modulation algorithm. Specifically, the model training process is\ndivided into two stages. In the first stage, a shared hyperparameter, which\nwould control the proportion of domain classification tasks across all fields,\nis determined. In the second stage, we introduce a novel domain-aware\nmodulation algorithm to adjust the domain information contained in the input\ntext, which is then calculated based on a gradient-based and loss-based method.\nIn summary, experimental results on a public sentiment analysis dataset\ncontaining 16 domains prove the superiority of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8c03\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9886\u57df\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3001\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9886\u57df\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u786e\u5b9a\u5171\u4eab\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u8c03\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b16\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8c03\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u9886\u57df\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

RL learns a driving policy\nthrough trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that\ncombines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has\nreceived insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various\npitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for\ncollisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a\ncollision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world\nscenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the\nreward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them\nhierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in\na normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the\noverall reward.

While this fine-grained approach can serve as a\ngeneric world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream\npolicy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time\ndeployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction.\nPlanning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues.\nHowever, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task\npredictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term\ngoals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient\nand accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks?\nTo address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP),\nwhich begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by\nrecursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The\ngrounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of\ntask completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning\nhorizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to\nsummarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action\nextraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon\nexperiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward\nplanning methods, achieving SOTA performance.

To address this limitation, we present\n\\emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET).\nInspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a\nvirtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external\nforces by manipulating the virtual spring.

We use a multimode resonance structure to\ndemonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure.\nTherefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart\nfilter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual\nneural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design\ntechniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved\ngeneralization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to\ngenerate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy\ninspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network\n(HiFR\\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate\nthat the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy\ncompared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical\nmetrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements.

In this work, we study an inverse\nproblem: given a target shape, find the poses of left and right hands that\ntogether best produce a shadow resembling the input. This problem is\nnontrivial, since the design space of 3D hand poses is huge while being\nrestrictive due to anatomical constraints. Also, we need to attend to the\ninput's shape and crucial features, though the input is colorless and\ntextureless. To meet these challenges, we design Hand-Shadow Poser, a\nthree-stage pipeline, to decouple the anatomical constraints (by hand) and\nsemantic constraints (by shadow shape): (i) a generative hand assignment module\nto explore diverse but reasonable left/right-hand shape hypotheses; (ii) a\ngeneralized hand-shadow alignment module to infer coarse hand poses with a\nsimilarity-driven strategy for selecting hypotheses; and (iii) a\nshadow-feature-aware refinement module to optimize the hand poses for physical\nplausibility and shadow feature preservation.

With the rapid\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence and deep learning technology,\nvisual-based interaction has gradually replaced traditional input devices and\nbecome an important way for intelligent systems to interact with users. The\nDeepSORT algorithm can achieve accurate target tracking in dynamic environments\nby combining Kalman filters and deep learning feature extraction methods. It is\nespecially suitable for complex scenes with multi-target tracking and fast\nmovements. This study experimentally verifies the superior performance of\nDeepSORT in gesture recognition and tracking. It can accurately capture and\ntrack the user's gesture trajectory and is superior to traditional tracking\nmethods in terms of real-time and accuracy. In addition, this study also\ncombines gesture recognition experiments to evaluate the recognition ability\nand feedback response of the DeepSORT algorithm under different gestures (such\nas sliding, clicking, and zooming). The experimental results show that DeepSORT\ncan not only effectively deal with target occlusion and motion blur but also\ncan stably track in a multi-target environment, achieving a smooth user\ninteraction experience. Finally, this paper looks forward to the future\ndevelopment direction of intelligent human-computer interaction systems based\non visual tracking and proposes future research focuses such as algorithm\noptimization, data fusion, and multimodal interaction in order to promote a\nmore intelligent and personalized interactive experience.

A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then\nfine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each\nstep. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this\napproach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated\nfine-tuning.\n  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs\nthat significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the\noverall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing\npruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an\nautomatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should\nbe performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning\nstep; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further\nimprove the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time\nconsumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the\nhyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components.\nWe evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can\naccelerate pruning by up to 9.61x.

We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2\nenvironments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average\nover hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with\n10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and\ntest-time changes.

A crucial but often under-explored component of\nthese systems is the reranker, which refines retrieved documents to enhance\ngeneration quality and explainability. The challenge of selecting the optimal\nnumber of documents (k) remains unsolved: too few may omit critical\ninformation, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent\nstudies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal\nmodel knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can\nprovide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking\ndecisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where\nthe reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved\ndocuments based on the query.

Once\nthe top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding\nthem as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by\nmulti-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images,\nwe demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels\ninstead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white\nblood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD)\nimages from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from\nmotion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield\nmicroscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities,\nSparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing\ncomputational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point\noperations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers.\nSince the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers\nimproved explainability.

Despite its effectiveness,\nreward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization,\nlosing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study\nthe cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the\nRLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs\nin unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state\nnorms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise\nsum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch,\nconstraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR\nin improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization,\nwhere BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare\nthe plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust\nRMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR\nto high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B\nscale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By\nconducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length\nby 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that\nrobustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training.

We validate our approach on the Unitree G1\nhumanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme\nsingle-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy\nremains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful\nsoccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.\nProject website: https://hub-robot.github.io", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faHuB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53c2\u8003\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u53c2\u8003\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHuB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u53c2\u8003\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Unitree G1\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u5355\u817f\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8e22\u817f\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u62b5\u6297\u7269\u7406\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "HuB\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as\nmitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts\nof a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level\nattribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text\ngeneration, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,\nrather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce\nConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies\nthe concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them\nimportance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current\ntoken-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through\nin-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g.,\ngender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and\nsteering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness\nof LLM responses, without requiring retraining.

We evaluate these embeddings on both intrinsic\nand extrinsic tasks to provide a holistic view of their performance. For\nintrinsic evaluation, we employ a word analogy task, which assesses the\nembeddings ability to capture semantic and syntactic relationships. Our results\nindicate that traditional static embeddings, particularly FastText, excel in\nthis task, achieving high accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores. Among\nthe BERT-based models, the X2Static method for extracting static embeddings\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to decontextualized and aggregate\nmethods, approaching the effectiveness of traditional static embeddings. For\nextrinsic evaluation, we utilize a bidirectional LSTM model to perform Named\nEntity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. The results\nreveal that embeddings derived from dynamic models, especially those extracted\nusing the X2Static method, outperform purely static embeddings. Notably, ELMo\nembeddings achieve the highest accuracy in both NER and POS tagging tasks,\nunderscoring the benefits of contextualized representations even when used in a\nstatic form. Our findings highlight the continued relevance of static word\nembeddings in NLP applications and the potential of advanced extraction methods\nto enhance the utility of BERT-based models.
