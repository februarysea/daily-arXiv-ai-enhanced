Analyzing a dataset\nof 793K TikTok videos related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we\nuncover a range of coordinated activities, from synchronized amplification of\npolitical narratives to semi-automated content replication using AI-generated\nvoiceovers and split-screen video formats.

However,\nphysiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels\nhinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain\nadaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues,\nespecially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and\nunlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level\nself-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory\nbuffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and\npseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling\ngeneralization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for\nemotion recognition.

For instance, our framework helps\ndetermine whether performance on a mathematical benchmark is an indication of\nthe ability to solve problems on math tests or instead indicates a broader\nability to reason. Our framework is well-suited for the contemporary paradigm\nin machine learning, where various stakeholders provide measurements and\nevaluations that downstream users use to validate their claims and decisions.\nAt the same time, our framework also informs the construction of evaluations\ndesigned to speak to the validity of the relevant claims. By leveraging\npsychometrics' breakdown of validity, evaluations can prioritize the most\ncritical facets for a given claim, improving empirical utility and\ndecision-making efficacy. We illustrate our framework through detailed case\nstudies of vision and language model evaluations, highlighting how explicitly\nconsidering validity strengthens the connection between evaluation evidence and\nthe claims being made.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u72ed\u9698\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u6240\u58f0\u79f0\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5982\u4f55\u5f3a\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u58f0\u79f0\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u8fdbAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6548\u7528\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Our\nfindings reveal significant patterns, including the consistent level of print\nadvertising over the past six years despite declining print circulation, the\noverrepresentation of company ads on prominent pages, and the disproportionate\nrevenue contributed by government ads.

To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we\npropose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of\nexamples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In\nthis paper we evaluate the complexity of teaching visual-language models a\nsubset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw\nimages as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate\nthat image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve\nhigher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the\nteaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even\nwhen controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the\nsimplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality\nrepresentations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u6559\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u662f\u5426\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u6559\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u4f4d\u56fe\uff09\u548c\u5750\u6807\uff08TikZ\u683c\u5f0f\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728Quick, Draw!\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u6559\u5b66\u7247\u6bb5\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u65e0\u5173\u3002"}}

A high rate\nof missed threats can be the result, as traditional machine learning models\ntend to struggle in identifying attacks when normal data volume is much higher\nthan the volume of attacks. For example, the dataset used in this study reveals\na strong class imbalance with 94,659 instances of the majority class and only\n28 instances of the minority class, making it quite challenging to determine\nrare attacks accurately. The challenges presented in this research are\naddressed by hybrid sampling techniques designed to improve data imbalance\ndetection accuracy in IoT domains. After applying these techniques, we evaluate\nthe performance of several machine learning models such as Random Forest, Soft\nVoting, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression with respect to the classification of\ncyber-attacks. The obtained results indicate that the Random Forest model\nachieved the best performance with a Kappa score of 0.9903, test accuracy of\n0.9961, and AUC of 0.9994. Strong performance is also shown by the Soft Voting\nmodel, with an accuracy of 0.9952 and AUC of 0.9997, indicating the benefits of\ncombining model predictions.

As the first\ncohort raised alongside AI, Gen Alpha faces new forms of online risk due to\nimmersive digital engagement and a growing mismatch between their evolving\ncommunication and existing safety tools. Their distinct language, shaped by\ngaming, memes, and AI-driven trends, often conceals harmful interactions from\nboth human moderators and automated systems. We assess four leading AI models\n(GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama 3) on their ability to detect masked\nharassment and manipulation within Gen Alpha discourse. Using a dataset of 100\nrecent expressions from gaming platforms, social media, and video content, the\nstudy reveals critical comprehension failures with direct implications for\nonline safety. This work contributes: (1) a first-of-its-kind dataset capturing\nGen Alpha expressions; (2) a framework to improve AI moderation systems for\nyouth protection; (3) a multi-perspective evaluation including AI systems,\nhuman moderators, and parents, with direct input from Gen Alpha co-researchers;\nand (4) an analysis of how linguistic divergence increases youth vulnerability.\nFindings highlight the urgent need to redesign safety systems attuned to youth\ncommunication, especially given Gen Alpha reluctance to seek help when adults\nfail to understand their digital world. This study combines the insight of a\nGen Alpha researcher with systematic academic analysis to address critical\ndigital safety challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9Gen Alpha\uff082010-2024\u5e74\u51fa\u751f\uff09\u6570\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "Gen Alpha\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e0eAI\u5171\u540c\u6210\u957f\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u5176\u6570\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u6e38\u620f\u3001\u6897\u548cAI\u8d8b\u52bf\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-4\u3001Claude\u3001Gemini\u548cLlama 3\u56db\u79cdAI\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9Gen Alpha\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528100\u6761\u6765\u81ea\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522bGen Alpha\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94Gen Alpha\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408Gen Alpha\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Deep learning models, while more computationally\nefficient, often have difficulty managing seasonal variations and uncertainties\nwhen dealing with complex sea ice dynamics. In this research, we introduce\nIceMamba, a deep learning architecture that integrates sophisticated attention\nmechanisms within the state space model. Through comparative analysis of 25\nrenowned forecast models, including dynamical, statistical, and deep learning\napproaches, our experimental results indicate that IceMamba delivers excellent\nseasonal forecasting capabilities for Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration.\nSpecifically, IceMamba outperforms all tested models regarding average RMSE and\nanomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and ranks second in Integrated Ice Edge\nError (IIEE).

While one line of existing MU methods relies on linear parameter\nupdates via task arithmetic, they suffer from weight entanglement. In this\nwork, we propose a novel MU framework called Mode Connectivity Unlearning (MCU)\nthat leverages mode connectivity to find an unlearning pathway in a nonlinear\nmanner. To further enhance performance and efficiency, we introduce a parameter\nmask strategy that not only improves unlearning effectiveness but also reduces\ncomputational overhead. Moreover, we propose an adaptive adjustment strategy\nfor our unlearning penalty coefficient to adaptively balance forgetting quality\nand predictive performance during training, eliminating the need for empirical\nhyperparameter tuning.

However, existing methods\nstruggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the\nprobabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either\nemploy shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on\ndeterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation\nparadigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic\nmultimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed\nabstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal\npatterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual\ncontexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal\nrepresentations.

Then, based on it, we cold-start our model's reasoning ability via SFT.\nIn addition, we further enhance reasoning regarding moderation through online\nRL. Concretely, to enhance diversity and difficulty of samples, we conduct\nrejection sampling followed by data augmentation via the proposed safety-aware\ndata concatenation. Besides, we use a dynamic clipping parameter to encourage\nexploration in early stages and exploitation in later stages. To balance\nperformance and token efficiency, we design a length-aware safety reward that\nintegrates accuracy, format, and token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority of our model. Remarkably, it surpasses the runner-up by 19.27%\nF1 score on average.

Although several foundation models for\nbiomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on\ncertain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen\ndomain data. We owe the deficiency to lack of vision-language knowledge before\nsegmentation. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us\nto leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling\nvision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on\ncross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose using MLLMs to guide SAM in\nlearning microscopy crose-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy,\nnamed uLLSAM. Specifically, we propose the Vision-Language Semantic Alignment\n(VLSA) module, which injects VLK into Segment Anything Model (SAM). We find\nthat after SAM receives global VLK prompts, its performance improves\nsignificantly, but there are deficiencies in boundary contour perception.\nTherefore, we further propose Semantic Boundary Regularization (SBR) to prompt\nSAM.

Although current\nNeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing\nbuilding-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference\nspeeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality\nrendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes.\nHowever, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an\neffective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required\noften lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges,\nwe propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for\noutdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the\ninitialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral\nmesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face,\neffectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions. Second, we\npropose an efficient Gaussian pruning strategy that evaluates each 3D\nGaussian's contribution to the view and prunes accordingly. To retain\ngeometry-critical Gaussian points, we also present a structure-aware\ndensification strategy that densifies Gaussian points in low-curvature regions.\nAdditionally, we employ vector quantization for parameter quantization of\nGaussian components, significantly reducing disk space requirements with only a\nminimal impact on rendering quality.

Multiple reasoning\nagents can collaborate to raise joint reasoning quality above individual\noutcomes. However, such agents typically interact in a turn-based manner,\ntrading increased latency for improved quality. In this paper, we propose Group\nThink--a single LLM that acts as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, or\nthinkers. With shared visibility into each other's partial generation progress,\nGroup Think introduces a new concurrent-reasoning paradigm in which multiple\nreasoning trajectories adapt dynamically to one another at the token level. For\nexample, a reasoning thread may shift its generation mid-sentence upon\ndetecting that another thread is better positioned to continue. This\nfine-grained, token-level collaboration enables Group Think to reduce redundant\nreasoning and improve quality while achieving significantly lower latency.\nMoreover, its concurrent nature allows for efficient utilization of idle\ncomputational resources, making it especially suitable for edge inference,\nwhere very small batch size often underutilizes local~GPUs.

Unlike traditional methods\nthat depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new\nobject shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence.\nThis results in robust performance across previously unseen objects.

This way, we found that\nRuleFit struggles with conjunctive and non-convex biases, while SHAP can\napproximate conjunctive biases but cannot express them as actionable rules.\nHence, we introduce RuleSHAP, a global rule extraction algorithm combining SHAP\nand RuleFit to detect more non-univariate biases, improving injected bias\ndetection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5e8f\u6570\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86RuleSHAP\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\uff08SDGs\uff09\u3002\u5f53\u524dXAI\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406LLM\u7684\u975e\u6570\u503c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5e8f\u6570\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u975e\u6570\u503c\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u8054\u5408\u3001\u975e\u51f8\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982RuleFit\u548cSHAP\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "RuleFit\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u504f\u89c1\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cSHAP\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8054\u5408\u504f\u89c1\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c4\u5219\u3002RuleSHAP\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u5c06\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534794%\uff08MRR@1\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RuleSHAP\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3aXAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We\nre-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing\nliterature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error\n(MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE)\nmetrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results.\nAdditionally, we analyze performance differences resulting from various\npre-processing techniques and dataset preparation parameters -- offering\nfurther insight into model generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPoseBench3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f303D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaPoseBench3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f3018\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210100\u591a\u9879\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "PoseBench3D\u4e3a3D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, all such techniques can only work with a single (human)\nobjective. In practice, human users have multiple objectives, such as\nhelpfulness and harmlessness, and there is no natural way to aggregate them\ninto a single objective. In this paper, we address the multi-objective\npreference-alignment problem, where a policy must optimize several, potentially\nconflicting, objectives. We introduce the Multi-Objective Preference\nOptimization (MOPO) algorithm, which frames alignment as a constrained\nKL-regularized optimization: the primary objective is maximized while secondary\nobjectives are lower-bounded by tunable safety thresholds. Unlike prior work,\nMOPO operates directly on pairwise preference data, requires no point-wise\nreward assumption, and avoids heuristic prompt-context engineering. The method\nrecovers policies on the Pareto front whenever the front is attainable;\npractically, it reduces to simple closed-form iterative updates suitable for\nlarge-scale training. On synthetic benchmarks with diverse canonical preference\nstructures, we show that MOPO approximates the Pareto front.

The value function associated with an RL policy is a natural Lyapunov\nfunction candidate but it is not clear how it should be modified. To gain\nintuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make\ntwo key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value\nfunction of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the\nsystem dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease\nrequirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only\ndecrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider\nthe nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov\nfunctions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms.\nOur approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on\nGymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks.

Instead, it leverages image-text latent\nspace and linear classifier probes to examine how the latent representation of\na superclass label$\\unicode{x2014}$shared by all instances in the\ndataset$\\unicode{x2014}$is influenced by the presence of a given concept. By\nmeasuring these shifts against the normal vector to the classifier's decision\nboundary, CUBIC identifies concepts that significantly influence model\npredictions. Our experiments demonstrate that CUBIC effectively uncovers\npreviously unknown biases using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without requiring\nthe samples in the dataset where the classifier underperforms or prior\nknowledge of potential biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "CUBIC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u5019\u9009\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u63a2\u6d4b\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u4e0d\u5168\u9762\u3002", "method": "CUBIC\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCUBIC\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "CUBIC\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on\ngeneral graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique\nchallenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive,\nheterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal\ndynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization\nschemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational\nGraph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed\nspecifically for relational tables.

Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple\ncaptions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically\nsimilar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To\novercome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for\nVLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary\ninformation from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies\nthrough feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive\nimportance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two\ntechniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In\nthe first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual\nevaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique\nsentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique,\nimportance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of\nrelying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA\nstrategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance\non text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed\nstrategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS.

Not Final Version", "summary": "Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent\ntext-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even\nharmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually\ncrafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure\n(efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In\nthis paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text\nand image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled\nconcept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address\nthis, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision\ninto the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative\nConcept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the\nconcept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images\ninduced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the\ntarget concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses\nthe knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure\nefficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement\nstrategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to\nthe specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts.\nFinally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms\nstate-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off\nbetween efficacy and usability.

To\ntackle these issues, we present a framework that learns dense HAnd COntact\nestimation (HACO) from imbalanced data. To resolve the class imbalance issue,\nwe introduce balanced contact sampling, which builds and samples from multiple\nsampling groups that fairly represent diverse contact statistics for both\ncontact and non-contact samples. Moreover, to address the spatial imbalance\nissue, we propose vertex-level class-balanced (VCB) loss, which incorporates\nspatially varying contact distribution by separately reweighting loss\ncontribution of each vertex based on its contact frequency across dataset.

In addition, BiDist operates as a\nconcise and efficient solution without the need for the complex and costly\nstorage of past policies. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical\nevidence to support BiDist's effectiveness. Our results highlight its\nremarkable generalization ability across a variety of cooperative, competitive,\nand social dilemma tasks, and reveal that BiDist significantly diversifies the\npolicy distribution space.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nDual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN), which dynamically adjusts loss weights by\nintegrating inter-balancing and intra-balancing to alleviate two imbalance\nissues in PINNs. Inter-balancing aims to mitigate the gradient imbalance\nbetween PDE residual loss and condition-fitting losses by determining an\naggregated weight that offsets their gradient distribution discrepancies.\nIntra-balancing acts on condition-fitting losses to tackle the imbalance in\nfitting difficulty across diverse conditions. By evaluating the fitting\ndifficulty based on the loss records, intra-balancing can allocate the\naggregated weight proportionally to each condition loss according to its\nfitting difficulty levels. We further introduce a robust weight update strategy\nto prevent abrupt spikes and arithmetic overflow in instantaneous weight values\ncaused by large loss variances, enabling smooth weight updating and stable\ntraining.

We address this gap and propose CROC: a\nscalable framework for automated Contrastive Robustness Checks that\nsystematically probes and quantifies metric robustness by synthesizing\ncontrastive test cases across a comprehensive taxonomy of image properties.\nWith CROC, we generate a pseudo-labeled dataset (CROC$^{syn}$) of over one\nmillion contrastive prompt-image pairs to enable a fine-grained comparison of\nevaluation metrics. We also use the dataset to train CROCScore, a new metric\nthat achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods,\ndemonstrating an additional key application of our framework. To complement\nthis dataset, we introduce a human-supervised benchmark (CROC$^{hum}$)\ntargeting especially challenging categories.

Furthermore, we\nintroduce Adaptive Unit Modulation (AUM) to facilitate interaction between body\nand hand units by using the information from one unit to adaptively modulate\nthe other. Finally, for the diffusion model, we employ a compact MLP as a noise\npredictor for each distinct body unit and incorporate the diffusion loss to\nmodel the probability distribution of each token.

Recent advances in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their\ncapabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations,\ngenerating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge,\ndespite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to\nevaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce\nEmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion\nhallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from\nthe interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven\nlearning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology\nprovides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on\nthis, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology\nknowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,\nwe utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs\ncarefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion\nhallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on\nEmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial\nissues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform\nopen-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability\nprovides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion\npsychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception.

This paper presents an architecture for a general user model\n(GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your\ncomputer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g.,\ndevice screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that\ncapture that user knowledge and preferences.

GUMs\nintroduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from\nmultimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and\ncontinuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of\napplications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based\nassistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface\nimportant information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences\nacross apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover\nand execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM.

Building on R1-style distilled models,\nwe observe that inserting a simple ellipsis (\"...\") into the prompt can\nstochastically trigger either a thinking or no-thinking mode, revealing a\nlatent controllability in the reasoning behavior. Leveraging this property, we\npropose AutoThink, a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that\nprogressively optimizes reasoning policies via stage-wise reward shaping.\nAutoThink learns to invoke explicit reasoning only when necessary, while\ndefaulting to succinct responses for simpler tasks. Experiments on five\nmainstream mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoThink achieves\nfavorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to recent prompting and\nRL-based pruning methods. It can be seamlessly integrated into any R1-style\nmodel, including both distilled and further fine-tuned variants.

Existing 3D segmentation\napproaches are computationally and memory intensive, often processing entire\nvolumes that contain many anatomically irrelevant slices. Meanwhile, 2D methods\nsuffer from class imbalance and lack cross-view contextual awareness. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel, anatomically-aware slice\nselector pipeline that reduces input volume prior to segmentation. Our unified\nframework introduces a vision-language model (VLM) for cross-view organ\npresence detection using fused tri-slice (2.5D) representations from axial,\nsagittal, and coronal planes.

This enables\nspatially consistent filtering across orientations while preserving contextual\ncues.

However, this paradigm often neglects the\nmodeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical\nconfounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the\nbehavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and\nlearn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles.

However,\napplying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to\ncontinuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse\nterrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GROQLoco, a scalable,\nattention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy\nacross multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline\ndatasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct\nlocomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain\ntraversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to\ntrain a generalist model that enables behavior fusion for both behaviors.\nCrucially, our framework operates directly on proprioceptive data from all\nrobots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is\ndirectly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs\nwithout any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate\nstrong zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains,\nincluding hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg\nrobot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where\ndifferent locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe\nsuccessful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all\nrobots at test time.

Despite this, humans can effortlessly\nhandle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing\nresearch in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity,\nprimarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment\nmanipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment\nspecifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation,\nwhich features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and\nrefines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the\nsim-to-real gap.

In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence\nto automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a\nsingle expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention.\nHowever, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of\ngarments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve\ngeneralization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a\nHierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies\ntransferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then\ngenerates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive\nexperiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate\nthat HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing\nto previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and\ndeformation where others fail.

While GNNs are typically\napplied in the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) case, the approximations are\nperformed in the single-input single-output (SISO) case. In this work, we first\nderive the MIMO graph convolution through the convolution theorem and\napproximate it directly in the MIMO case. We find the key MIMO-specific\nproperty of the graph convolution to be operating on multiple computational\ngraphs, or equivalently, applying distinct feature transformations for each\npair of nodes.

We draw a\nparallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains why\nlarge language models trained on text can be repurposed for time series\nforecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between\nforecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the attractor,\nproviding insight into the previously observed in-context neural scaling laws.\nContext parroting thus serves as a simple but tough-to-beat baseline for future\ntime-series foundation models and can help identify in-context learning\nstrategies beyond parroting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u5236\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose\nFractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework that\nleverages fractal self-similarity to enforce global topological coherence.\nFractalGCL introduces two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation\nthat generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a\nfractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according\nto their fractal dimensions. While combining the two innovations markedly\nboosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational\noverhead.

In this paradigm, planning is executed\nvia sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual\ndomain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a\nnovel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement\nLearning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,\nleading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of\nrepresentative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our\nvisual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct\nreasoning in the text-only space.

The special phenomenon of grokking, where\nNNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a\nnear-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying\nmechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for\ngrokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a\nphysical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is\nthe system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of\nliquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later\ngeneralization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration.\nThis mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density)\nlandscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in\ntransformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in\nthe memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous\ntheory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a\nhigh-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking\nentropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's\nfar-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on\nWang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any\nconstraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions.

Recent work has shown that, under\nassumptions on decaying inter-agent influence, global observability can be\nreplaced by local neighborhood observability at each agent, enabling\ndecentralization and scalability. Real-world applications enjoying such decay\nproperties remain underexplored, however, despite the fact that signal power\ndecay, or signal attenuation, due to path loss is an intrinsic feature of many\nproblems in wireless communications and radar networks.

In optimization theory, a\nsemi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over\nthe cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space.\nThese problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization\ncommunities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are\nessentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by\nquantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the\naforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant\nsolution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is\nconcave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard\n(stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these\nparameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly.

However, it remains uncertain if longer reasoning chains inherently\nenhance factual accuracy, particularly beyond mathematical contexts. In this\nwork, we thoroughly examine LLM reasoning within complex open-domain\nquestion-answering (QA) scenarios. We initially distill reasoning traces from\nadvanced, large-scale reasoning models (QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1-671B), then\nfine-tune a variety of models ranging from smaller, instruction-tuned variants\nto larger architectures based on Qwen2.5. To enrich reasoning traces, we\nintroduce factual information from knowledge graphs in the form of paths into\nour reasoning traces. Our experimental setup includes four baseline approaches\nand six different instruction-tuned models evaluated across a benchmark of six\ndatasets, encompassing over 22.6K questions. Overall, we carry out 168\nexperimental runs and analyze approximately 1.7 million reasoning traces.

Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS\nSystem evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies,\nand limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a\nmulti-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles,\ncontext diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in\nChinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio\nTuring Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired\nwith a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on\ncomplex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge\nwhether a voice sounds human.

However, a key limitation of these methods is\nthe assumption that outcome measures are identical across datasets -- an\nassumption that often does not hold in practice. Consider the following opioid\nuse disorder (OUD) studies: the XBOT trial and the POAT study, both evaluating\nthe effect of medications for OUD on withdrawal symptom severity (not the\nprimary outcome of either trial). While XBOT measures withdrawal severity using\nthe subjective opiate withdrawal scale, POAT uses the clinical opiate\nwithdrawal scale. We analyze this realistic yet challenging setting where\noutcome measures differ across studies and where neither study records both\ntypes of outcomes. Our paper studies whether and when integrating studies with\ndisparate outcome measures leads to efficiency gains. We introduce three sets\nof assumptions -- with varying degrees of strength -- linking both outcome\nmeasures. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight a cautionary tale:\nintegration can improve asymptotic efficiency only under the strongest\nassumption linking the outcomes. However, misspecification of this assumption\nleads to bias. In contrast, a milder assumption may yield finite-sample\nefficiency gains, yet these benefits diminish as sample size increases. We\nillustrate these trade-offs via a case study integrating the XBOT and POAT\ndatasets to estimate the comparative effect of two medications for opioid use\ndisorder on withdrawal symptoms. By systematically varying the assumptions\nlinking the SOW and COW scales, we show potential efficiency gains and the\nrisks of bias.

This study explores the\nfeasibility of deriving Mercury's regolith elemental composition from in-situ\nmeasurements of its neutral exosphere using deep neural networks (DNNs). We\npresent a supervised feed-forward DNN architecture - a multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) - that, starting from exospheric densities and proton precipitation\nfluxes, predicts the chemical elements of the surface regolith below. It serves\nas an estimator for the surface-exosphere interaction and the processes leading\nto exosphere formation. Because the DNN requires a comprehensive exospheric\ndataset not available from previous missions, this study uses simulated\nexosphere components and simulated drivers. Extensive training and testing\ncampaigns demonstrate the MLP's ability to accurately predict and reconstruct\nsurface composition maps from these simulated measurements.

However, as embedding tables grow, closed-form solutions\nbecome impractical, often necessitating the use of mini-batch gradient descent\nfor training. Despite extensive work on designing loss functions to train CF\nmodels, we argue that one core component of these pipelines is heavily\noverlooked: weight decay. Attaining high-performing models typically requires\ncareful tuning of weight decay, regardless of loss, yet its necessity is not\nwell understood. In this work, we question why weight decay is crucial in CF\npipelines and how it impacts training. Through theoretical and empirical\nanalysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to\nencode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors.\nMoreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to\ninfluence preference towards popular or unpopular items.

However, GPs suffer when the amount of training\ndata is large or when the underlying function contains multi-scale features\nthat are difficult to represent by a stationary kernel. To address the former,\ntraining of GPs with large-scale data is often performed through inducing point\napproximations (also known as sparse GP regression (GPR)), where the size of\nthe covariance matrices in GPR is reduced considerably through a greedy search\non the data set. To aid the latter, deep GPs have gained traction as\nhierarchical models that resolve multi-scale features by combining multiple\nGPs. Posterior inference in deep GPs requires a sampling or, more usual, a\nvariational approximation. Variational approximations lead to large-scale\nstochastic, non-convex optimisation problems and the resulting approximation\ntends to represent uncertainty incorrectly.
