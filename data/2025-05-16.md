### [1] [Healthy Distrust in AI systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09747)
*Benjamin Paaßen,Suzana Alpsancar,Tobias Matzner,Ingrid Scharlau*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出“健康的不信任”概念，强调在某些AI使用场景中，合理的不信任是必要的，以保护人类自主性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究强调信任以促进采用，但忽视社会背景下AI可能被滥用的情况，需引入合理的不信任概念。

Method: 通过跨学科（计算机科学、社会学、心理学等）分析信任与不信任的现有理论，填补概念空白。

Result: 提出“健康的不信任”作为尊重人类自主性的AI使用关键组成部分。

Conclusion: 合理的不信任是构建真正信任的基础，对AI伦理设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Under the slogan of trustworthy AI, much of contemporary AI research is
focused on designing AI systems and usage practices that inspire human trust
and, thus, enhance adoption of AI systems. However, a person affected by an AI
system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they,
if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to
believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases,
distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust
in the first place. We propose the term "healthy distrust" to describe such a
justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate
prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history,
psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might
fill and conceptualize healthy distrust as a crucial part for AI usage that
respects human autonomy.

### [2] [Which Demographic Features Are Relevant for Individual Fairness Evaluation of U.S. Recidivism Risk Assessment Tools?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09868)
*Tin Trung Nguyen,Jiannan Xu,Phuong-Anh Nguyen-Le,Jonathan Lazar,Donald Braman,Hal Daumé III,Zubin Jelveh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文研究了个人公平性标准在再犯风险评估工具中的应用，通过实验确定年龄和性别应纳入相似性函数，而种族应忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管个人公平性标准在美国宪法中有基础，但尚未在州或联邦法规中具体操作化。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过人类受试者实验，评估哪些人口特征与个人公平性评估相关。

Result: 分析表明，个人相似性函数应考虑年龄和性别，但忽略种族。

Conclusion: 研究为再犯风险评估工具的个人公平性标准提供了具体操作建议。

Abstract: Despite its U.S. constitutional foundation, the technical ``individual
fairness'' criterion has not been operationalized in state or federal
statutes/regulations. We conduct a human subjects experiment to address this
gap, evaluating which demographic features are relevant for individual fairness
evaluation of recidivism risk assessment (RRA) tools. Our analyses conclude
that the individual similarity function should consider age and sex, but it
should ignore race.

### [3] [To what extent can current French mobile network support agricultural robots?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10044)
*Pierre La Rocca,Gaël Guennebaud,Aurélie Bugeau*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种评估大规模农业机器人部署对能源消耗和碳足迹影响的方法，并分析了网络基础设施限制下可管理的农业面积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业机器人虽能提升可持续性和粮食产量，但其部署所需的能源和环境后果在文献中被忽视。

Method: 提出了一种评估能源消耗和碳足迹的方法，并结合网络基础设施限制估计可管理的农业面积。

Result: 机器人比特率需求增加会显著提升能源和环境影响，且现有网络下可管理农业面积迅速减少。

Conclusion: 需综合考虑机器人比特率需求和网络基础设施限制，以优化农业机器人部署的可持续性。

Abstract: The large-scale integration of robots in agriculture offers many promises for
enhancing sustainability and increasing food production. The numerous
applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile
network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the
robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure
required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and
environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture
literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional
energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of
agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area
that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network
infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France
mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios.
Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant
additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by
classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the
existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing
manageable agricultural area.

### [4] [Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Approaches for Automatic Educational Knowledge Graph Construction in CourseMapper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10069)
*Qurat Ul Ain,Mohamed Amine Chatti,Amr Shakhshir,Jean Qussa,Rawaa Alatrash,Shoeb Joarder*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 比较了自顶向下和自底向上两种方法构建教育知识图谱（EduKG）的效果，发现自底向上方法更优，并结合人工审核提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为数字学习环境（如MOOCs）构建准确的教育知识图谱，以支持个性化学习。

Method: 比较自顶向下和自底向上方法，并通过用户研究和专家验证（简单随机抽样）评估效果。

Result: 自底向上方法在识别和映射知识概念上更准确，结合人工审核进一步提升精度。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展的框架，优化MOOCs中的知识表示，支持个性化学习。

Abstract: The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is
crucial for modeling domain knowledge in digital learning environments,
particularly in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). However, identifying the
most effective approach for constructing accurate EduKGs remains a challenge.
This study compares Top-down and Bottom-up approaches for automatic EduKG
construction, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing and structuring
knowledge concepts from learning materials in our MOOC platform CourseMapper.
Through a user study and expert validation using Simple Random Sampling (SRS),
results indicate that the Bottom-up approach outperforms the Top-down approach
in accurately identifying and mapping key knowledge concepts. To further
enhance EduKG accuracy, we integrate a Human-in-the-Loop approach, allowing
course moderators to review and refine the EduKG before publication. This
structured comparison provides a scalable framework for improving knowledge
representation in MOOCs, ultimately supporting more personalized and adaptive
learning experiences.

### [5] [Lost in Models? Structuring Managerial Decision Support in Process Mining with Multi-criteria Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10236)
*Rob H. Bemthuis*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多准则决策（MCDM）的方法，通过结合定量和定性指标来评估和优先处理流程模型，以解决模型过载和决策复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代组织中流程挖掘的广泛应用导致模型数量激增，增加了决策的复杂性，需要一种综合方法来优化模型选择。

Method: 采用多准则决策方法（如层次分析法AHP），结合定量指标（如拟合度、精确度）和定性因素（如文化适应性）来评估流程模型。

Result: 初步研究表明，MCDM方法能够增强情境敏感的决策能力，所选模型既能满足操作指标，又能符合管理需求。

Conclusion: 尽管研究处于早期阶段，但为探索MCDM驱动的策略奠定了基础，以提升流程挖掘在复杂组织环境中的作用。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly adopted in modern organizations, producing
numerous process models that, while valuable, can lead to model overload and
decision-making complexity. This paper explores a multi-criteria
decision-making (MCDM) approach to evaluate and prioritize process models by
incorporating both quantitative metrics (e.g., fitness, precision) and
qualitative factors (e.g., cultural fit). An illustrative logistics example
demonstrates how MCDM, specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP),
facilitates trade-off analysis and promotes alignment with managerial
objectives. Initial insights suggest that the MCDM approach enhances
context-sensitive decision-making, as selected models address both operational
metrics and broader managerial needs. While this study is an early-stage
exploration, it provides an initial foundation for deeper exploration of
MCDM-driven strategies to enhance the role of process mining in complex
organizational settings.

### [6] [Formalising Human-in-the-Loop: Computational Reductions, Failure Modes, and Legal-Moral Responsibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10426)
*Maurice Chiodo,Dennis Müller,Paul Siewert,Jean-Luc Wetherall,Zoya Yasmine,John Burden*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了不同人机交互（HITL）设置的法律合规性与安全性，揭示了法律责任分配与技术可解释性之间的必然权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于为AI开发者与立法者提供新的视角，以更有效地设计和规范HITL设置，避免不必要的人类替罪现象。

Method: 方法包括利用计算理论中的预言机概念形式化HITL设置，并提出分类法以分析其失败模式。

Result: 结果揭示了现有法律框架的局限性，并提出了改进建议，以更好地适应不同HITL设置的实际效果。

Conclusion: 结论强调HITL设计中的技术决策复杂性，呼吁开发者与立法者共同优化HITL以实现预期目标。

Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups
for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing
between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between
the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.
We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to
formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human
monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction
between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one
reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL
failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL
setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and
EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always
achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest
areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups
and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and
unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve
many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often
out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the
challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers
and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.

### [7] [Campus AI vs Commercial AI: A Late-Breaking Study on How LLM As-A-Service Customizations Shape Trust and Usage Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10490)
*Leon Hannig,Annika Bush,Meltem Aksoy,Steffen Becker,Greta Ontrup*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型即服务（LLMaaS）的用户界面和品牌定制如何影响用户信任和使用模式，为后续大规模实地研究做准备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育领域的普及，大学需要制定AI策略，而现有研究多关注数据或模型调整，本研究聚焦用户可见的定制化（如界面和品牌）对信任的影响。

Method: 通过小规模预研，探讨LLMaaS定制化的心理效应，并优化研究方法，为后续在德国大学的大规模实地研究做准备。

Result: 预研旨在引发对LLMaaS定制化心理效应的讨论，并为后续研究提供反馈。

Conclusion: 未来研究将深化对LLMs信任机制的理解，为组织部署LLMaaS提供实践指导。

Abstract: As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) by students, lecturers and
researchers becomes more prevalent, universities - like other organizations -
are pressed to develop coherent AI strategies. LLMs as-a-Service (LLMaaS) offer
accessible pre-trained models, customizable to specific (business) needs. While
most studies prioritize data, model, or infrastructure adaptations (e.g., model
fine-tuning), we focus on user-salient customizations, like interface changes
and corporate branding, which we argue influence users' trust and usage
patterns. This study serves as a functional prequel to a large-scale field
study in which we examine how students and employees at a German university
perceive and use their institution's customized LLMaaS compared to ChatGPT. The
goals of this prequel are to stimulate discussions on psychological effects of
LLMaaS customizations and refine our research approach through feedback. Our
forthcoming findings will deepen the understanding of trust dynamics in LLMs,
providing practical guidance for organizations considering LLMaaS deployment.

### [8] [AI and Generative AI Transforming Disaster Management: A Survey of Damage Assessment and Response Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08202)
*Aman Raj,Lakshit Arora,Sanjay Surendranath Girija,Shashank Kapoor,Dipen Pradhan,Ankit Shetgaonkar*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文综述了AI和GenAI在自然灾害损害评估中的应用，探讨了其优势、局限性及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害对人类生命和基础设施构成巨大威胁，快速高效的损害评估对有效应对至关重要。AI和GenAI提供了突破性解决方案。

Method: 通过多模态数据（文本、图像、视频、音频）分析，结合模拟现实场景和趋势识别，评估损害强度。

Result: AI和GenAI在损害评估中展现出高效性和潜力，但也面临数据隐私、安全及伦理问题，以及技术被滥用的风险。

Conclusion: 未来需开发安全、可靠且符合伦理的GenAI系统，以支持灾害管理。本文是首个全面调查GenAI在灾害评估与响应中应用的综述。

Abstract: Natural disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires and cyclones, bear a huge
risk on human lives as well as infrastructure assets. An effective response to
disaster depends on the ability to rapidly and efficiently assess the intensity
of damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) presents a breakthrough solution, capable of combining knowledge from
multiple types and sources of data, simulating realistic scenarios of disaster,
and identifying emerging trends at a speed previously unimaginable. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive review on the prospects of AI and GenAI in
damage assessment for various natural disasters, highlighting both its
strengths and limitations. We talk about its application to multimodal data
such as text, image, video, and audio, and also cover major issues of data
privacy, security, and ethical use of the technology during crises. The paper
also recognizes the threat of Generative AI misuse, in the form of
dissemination of misinformation and for adversarial attacks. Finally, we
outline avenues of future research, emphasizing the need for secure, reliable,
and ethical Generative AI systems for disaster management in general. We
believe that this work represents the first comprehensive survey of Gen-AI
techniques being used in the field of Disaster Assessment and Response.

### [9] [Hamilton's Rule for Enabling Altruism in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09841)
*Brooks A. Butler,Magnus Egerstedt*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将汉密尔顿规则应用于多智能体系统中的利他决策，通过任务生产力定义智能体“适应度”，并提出基于图的模型和协作控制Lyapunov函数解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物利他主义启发，研究多智能体系统中个体智能体何时应承担成本以惠及邻居，以提高系统效率。

Method: 通过基于图的多智能体交互模型形式化利他决策，采用协作控制Lyapunov函数作为解决方案。

Result: 在多智能体导航问题中，智能体重要性水平影响利他决策，从而提升导航任务的协调效率。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了利他行为对系统集体目标达成效率的贡献，为多智能体系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of Hamilton's rule to altruistic
decision-making in multi-agent systems. Inspired by biological altruism, we
introduce a framework that evaluates when individual agents should incur costs
to benefit their neighbors. By adapting Hamilton's rule, we define agent
``fitness" in terms of task productivity rather than genetic survival. We
formalize altruistic decision-making through a graph-based model of multi-agent
interactions and propose a solution using collaborative control Lyapunov
functions. The approach ensures that altruistic behaviors contribute to the
collective goal-reaching efficiency of the system. We illustrate this framework
on a multi-agent way-point navigation problem, where we show through simulation
how agent importance levels influence altruistic decision-making, leading to
improved coordination in navigation tasks.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Path Finding For Large Agents Is Intractable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10387)
*Artem Agafonov,Konstantin Yakovlev*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文证明了考虑大尺寸代理的多代理路径规划问题（MAPF）是NP难的，填补了该领域的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人等实际应用中，代理的尺寸不可忽略，而现有研究未明确考虑此类冲突的复杂性。

Method: 通过将经典的3SAT问题（NP完全问题）归约到MAPF问题，构造特定图例并证明其等价性。

Result: 首次证明考虑大尺寸代理的MAPF问题是NP难的，表明不存在多项式时间算法（假设P≠NP）。

Conclusion: 研究填补了理论空白，为实际应用中的路径规划提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a
graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never
encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called
Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are
considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time
step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking
into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can
be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of
conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the
body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying
still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how
harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while
planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an
undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete
polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In
this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard
and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be
presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of
reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)
to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we
procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices
and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path
finding instance has a solution.

### [11] [Tales of the 2025 Los Angeles Fire: Hotwash for Public Health Concerns in Reddit via LLM-Enhanced Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09665)
*Sulong Zhou,Qunying Huang,Shaoheng Zhou,Yun Hang,Xinyue Ye,Aodong Mei,Kathryn Phung,Yuning Ye,Uma Govindswamy,Zehan Li*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析2025年洛杉矶野火期间的Reddit讨论，利用主题建模和分层框架，揭示了公众对灾难的感知和反应，重点关注情境意识和危机叙事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解受灾人群在野火危机中的感知和反应，为灾难响应提供及时和共情的支持。

Method: 收集385篇帖子和114,879条评论，采用主题建模方法（结合LLMs和HITL）和分层框架（SA和CN）进行分析。

Result: SA类别与火灾进展紧密相关，公众健康和心理健康是主要关注点；CN类别中，悲伤信号和心理健康风险分别占60%和40%。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个标注的社交媒体数据集，并提出了一种可扩展的分析框架，为灾难响应和公共卫生策略提供了依据。

Abstract: Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent
years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during
wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social
media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public
discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment.
This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires,
spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385
posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt
topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large
language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we
develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two
main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The
volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking
within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most
frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and
damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related
latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one
health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60
percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest
total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated
social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable
multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse
analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can
inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public
health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related
disaster events.

*Anjali de Silva,Gang Chen,Hui Ma,Seyed Mohammad Nekooei,Xingquan Zuo*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: TAS-Com是一种新的社区检测方法，通过结合拓扑和属性相似性，利用Leiden算法优化模块化和人类标签的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCNs在最大化模块化时易陷入次优解，且直接使用人类标签可能破坏拓扑连贯性。

Method: 提出TAS-Com方法，引入新损失函数，利用Leiden算法优化社区结构并修正人类标签。

Result: 在多个基准网络上，TAS-Com显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: TAS-Com在模块化和人类标签遵从性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Community detection, a vital technology for real-world applications, uncovers
cohesive node groups (communities) by leveraging both topological and attribute
similarities in social networks. However, existing Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) trained to maximize modularity often converge to suboptimal solutions.
Additionally, directly using human-labeled communities for training can
undermine topological cohesiveness by grouping disconnected nodes based solely
on node attributes. We address these issues by proposing a novel Topological
and Attributive Similarity-based Community detection (TAS-Com) method. TAS-Com
introduces a novel loss function that exploits the highly effective and
scalable Leiden algorithm to detect community structures with global optimal
modularity. Leiden is further utilized to refine human-labeled communities to
ensure connectivity within each community, enabling TAS-Com to detect community
structures with desirable trade-offs between modularity and compliance with
human labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark networks confirm that
TAS-Com can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms.

### [13] [Community Fact-Checks Do Not Break Follower Loyalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10254)
*Michelle Bobek,Nicolas Pröllochs*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 研究发现，社区事实核查不会显著减少发布误导性内容的用户的粉丝数量，表明粉丝对发布者保持忠诚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社区事实核查对用户粉丝数量的影响，填补此前研究的空白。

Method: 采用准实验方法，分析3516条社区事实核查帖子的时间序列数据。

Result: 社区事实核查未导致发布误导性内容的用户粉丝数量显著下降。

Conclusion: 需要补充干预措施以更有效遏制社交媒体的虚假信息传播。

Abstract: Major social media platforms increasingly adopt community-based fact-checking
to address misinformation on their platforms. While previous research has
largely focused on its effect on engagement (e.g., reposts, likes), an
understanding of how fact-checking affects a user's follower base is missing.
In this study, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally assess whether
users lose followers after their posts are corrected via community fact-checks.
Based on time-series data on follower counts for N=3516 community fact-checked
posts from X, we find that community fact-checks do not lead to meaningful
declines in the follower counts of users who post misleading content. This
suggests that followers of spreaders of misleading posts tend to remain loyal
and do not view community fact-checks as a sufficient reason to disengage. Our
findings underscore the need for complementary interventions to more
effectively disincentivize the production of misinformation on social media.

*Chiara Drolsbach,Nicolas Pröllochs*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析社交媒体平台X上的91,452条误导性帖子，揭示了AI生成虚假信息的独特特征，包括其娱乐性、正面情感、小账号来源、高传播性以及相对较低的危害性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的虚假信息（如深度伪造）对社交媒体信息完整性构成威胁，但此前研究多关注其潜在社会影响而非实际存在情况。

Method: 研究通过X平台的Community Notes数据集，对AI生成与非AI生成的误导性帖子进行大规模实证分析。

Result: 发现AI生成虚假信息更偏向娱乐内容、正面情感，多来自小账号，但传播性更强，且危害性略低于传统虚假信息。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AI生成虚假信息的独特性，为平台管理和未来研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: AI-generated misinformation (e.g., deepfakes) poses a growing threat to
information integrity on social media. However, prior research has largely
focused on its potential societal consequences rather than its real-world
prevalence. In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of
AI-generated misinformation on the social media platform X. Specifically, we
analyze a dataset comprising N=91,452 misleading posts, both AI-generated and
non-AI-generated, that have been identified and flagged through X's Community
Notes platform. Our analysis yields four main findings: (i) AI-generated
misinformation is more often centered on entertaining content and tends to
exhibit a more positive sentiment than conventional forms of misinformation,
(ii) it is more likely to originate from smaller user accounts, (iii) despite
this, it is significantly more likely to go viral, and (iv) it is slightly less
believable and harmful compared to conventional misinformation. Altogether, our
findings highlight the unique characteristics of AI-generated misinformation on
social media. We discuss important implications for platforms and future
research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确计算$(p,q)$-双团数量计算复杂度高，而许多应用场景（如图核方法）并不严格要求精确计数，因此需要一种可扩展且高质量的近似解决方案。

Method: 利用$(p,q)$-broom（双团的一种特殊生成树），通过图着色和动态编程计数，并基于动态编程中间结果设计高效采样算法近似双团数量。

Result: 理论证明提供无偏估计和误差保证；实验表明在9个真实二分图网络上，算法在精度（误差减少8倍）和运行时间（加速50倍）上优于现有近似技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模$(p,q)$-双团计数提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of
applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet,
it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to
exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel
methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable
and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a
special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph
coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results
of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to
derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts.
Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error
guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation
techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up
to 50$\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a
scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的搜索算法，用于双人零和完美信息游戏，并在短时间和中等搜索时间下表现出优于现有算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对游戏搜索算法性能通用性的研究，尤其是在双人零和完美信息游戏中。

Method: 提出了一种新的搜索算法，并在22种游戏上进行了大规模实验。

Result: 在短搜索时间内，新算法在所有游戏中表现最佳；在中等搜索时间内，在17/22的游戏中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 新算法在双人零和完美信息游戏中具有显著优势，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Games, in their mathematical sense, are everywhere (game industries,
economics, defense, education, chemistry, biology, ...).Search algorithms in
games are artificial intelligence methods for playing such games.
Unfortunately, there is no study on these algorithms that evaluates the
generality of their performance. We propose to address this gap in the case of
two-player zero-sum games with perfect information. Furthermore, we propose a
new search algorithm and we show that, for a short search time, it outperforms
all studied algorithms on all games in this large experiment and that, for a
medium search time, it outperforms all studied algorithms on 17 of the 22
studied games.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法显著提高了特征重要性分析的效率和范围，为模型解释提供了新工具。

Abstract: Given a classification model and a prediction for some input, there are
heuristic strategies for ranking features according to their importance in
regard to the prediction. One common approach to this task is rooted in
propositional logic and the notion of \textit{sufficient reason}. Through this
concept, the categories of relevant and necessary features were proposed in
order to identify the crucial aspects of the input. This paper improves the
existing techniques and algorithms for deciding which are the relevant and/or
necessary features, showing in particular that necessity can be detected
efficiently in complex models such as neural networks. We also generalize the
notion of relevancy and study associated problems. Moreover, we present a new
global notion (i.e. that intends to explain whether a feature is important for
the behavior of the model in general, not depending on a particular input) of
\textit{usefulness} and prove that it is related to relevancy and necessity.
Furthermore, we develop efficient algorithms for detecting it in decision trees
and other more complex models, and experiment on three datasets to analyze its
practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中，传统GR方法难以适应多变的目标，因此需要一种更通用的动态GR解决方案。

Method: 采用无模型目标条件强化学习（RL）方法，实现快速适应不同任务的目标识别。

Result: 该方法能够有效应对动态环境中的目标识别问题。

Conclusion: 论文为动态GR问题提供了新的研究方向和解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding an agent's intent through its behavior is essential in
human-robot interaction, interactive AI systems, and multi-agent
collaborations. This task, known as Goal Recognition (GR), poses significant
challenges in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and constantly
evolving. Traditional GR methods, designed for a predefined set of goals, often
struggle to adapt to these dynamic scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce the General Dynamic GR problem - a broader definition of GR - aimed
at enabling real-time GR systems and fostering further research in this area.
Expanding on this foundation, this paper employs a model-free goal-conditioned
RL approach to enable fast adaptation for GR across various changing tasks.

TL;DR: XpertXAI是一种基于专家驱动的可解释AI模型，用于多肺病理检测，优于现有方法，并提供与专家判断一致的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在肺部病理检测中决策不透明的问题，推动临床可解释AI的应用。

Method: 扩展ClinicXAI，提出XpertXAI，结合InceptionV3分类器和公共数据集，对比后置解释方法和无监督CBM。

Result: XpertXAI在预测准确性和解释临床意义方面优于基线方法，与专家判断更一致。

Conclusion: XpertXAI展示了可扩展的人类中心设计在医学诊断中的潜力，为临床可解释AI提供路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in lung pathology detection from
chest X-rays, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited due to opaque
model decision-making. In prior work, we introduced ClinicXAI, a human-centric,
expert-guided concept bottleneck model (CBM) designed for interpretable lung
cancer diagnosis. We now extend that approach and present XpertXAI, a
generalizable expert-driven model that preserves human-interpretable clinical
concepts while scaling to detect multiple lung pathologies. Using a
high-performing InceptionV3-based classifier and a public dataset of chest
X-rays with radiology reports, we compare XpertXAI against leading post-hoc
explainability methods and an unsupervised CBM, XCBs. We assess explanations
through comparison with expert radiologist annotations and medical ground
truth. Although XpertXAI is trained for multiple pathologies, our expert
validation focuses on lung cancer. We find that existing techniques frequently
fail to produce clinically meaningful explanations, omitting key diagnostic
features and disagreeing with radiologist judgments. XpertXAI not only
outperforms these baselines in predictive accuracy but also delivers
concept-level explanations that better align with expert reasoning. While our
focus remains on explainability in lung cancer detection, this work illustrates
how human-centric model design can be effectively extended to broader
diagnostic contexts - offering a scalable path toward clinically meaningful
explainable AI in medical diagnostics.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在自动指标和基于LLM的评估中均优于基线，生成更准确、结构化和可解释的报告。

Conclusion: 多代理框架在临床AI应用中具有潜力，可支持可解释和可信赖的临床应用。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce diagnostic
reports from medical images, with the potential to enhance clinical workflows
and reduce radiologists' workload. While recent approaches leveraging
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have achieved strong results, they continue to face challenges such as
factual inconsistency, hallucination, and cross-modal misalignment. We propose
a multimodal multi-agent framework for RRG that aligns with the stepwise
clinical reasoning workflow, where task-specific agents handle retrieval, draft
generation, visual analysis, refinement, and synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms a strong baseline in both automatic
metrics and LLM-based evaluations, producing more accurate, structured, and
interpretable reports. This work highlights the potential of clinically aligned
multi-agent frameworks to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI
applications.

Abstract: The trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of relentless
acceleration, evolving from rudimentary rule-based systems to sophisticated,
autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and interaction. This whitepaper
chronicles this remarkable journey, charting the key technological
milestones--advancements in prompting, training methodologies, hardware
capabilities, and architectural innovations--that have converged to create the
AI agents of today. We argue that these agents, exemplified by systems like
OpenAI's ChatGPT with plugins and xAI's Grok, represent a culminating phase in
AI development, potentially constituting the "final generation" of intelligence
as we currently conceive it. We explore the capabilities and underlying
technologies of these agents, grounded in practical examples, while also
examining the profound societal implications and the unprecedented pace of
progress that suggests intelligence is now doubling approximately every six
months. The paper concludes by underscoring the critical need for wisdom and
foresight in navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by this
powerful new era of intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对问题质量的全面评估不足，因此需要建立一个灵活且全面的框架来定义和评估好问题。

Result: 在CAUS和SQUARE数据集上验证了框架的有效性，能够评估结构良好和有问题的问题，并适应不同上下文。

Conclusion: 本研究为问题行为与结构化分析方法结合提供了重要基础，推动了问题质量评估的进一步发展。

Abstract: Questioning has become increasingly crucial for both humans and artificial
intelligence, yet there remains limited research comprehensively assessing
question quality. In response, this study defines good questions and presents a
systematic evaluation framework. We propose two key evaluation dimensions:
appropriateness (sociolinguistic competence in context) and effectiveness
(strategic competence in goal achievement). Based on these foundational
dimensions, a rubric-based scoring system was developed. By incorporating
dynamic contextual variables, our evaluation framework achieves structure and
flexibility through semi-adaptive criteria. The methodology was validated using
the CAUS and SQUARE datasets, demonstrating the ability of the framework to
access both well-formed and problematic questions while adapting to varied
contexts. As we establish a flexible and comprehensive framework for question
evaluation, this study takes a significant step toward integrating questioning
behavior with structured analytical methods grounded in the intrinsic nature of
questioning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估AI常识的新方法，考虑了人类常识的多样性，发现LLMs在常识能力上低于人类中位数，且与人类共识相关性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法假设人类常识是单一的，但实证显示人类常识存在巨大差异，因此需要一种新方法来更准确地评估AI的常识能力。

Method: 通过测量模型判断与人类群体判断的对应关系，评估LLMs的常识能力，并比较不同规模模型的性能。

Result: LLMs在个体常识能力上低于人类中位数，且与人类共识相关性有限；小型开源模型表现优于大型专有模型。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁AI模型应适应不同文化背景的人类群体，以更好地反映常识的多样性。

Abstract: Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks
that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An
important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately
capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as
homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary
enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident
to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel
method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),
specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically
observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a
model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when
treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human
median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as
simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only
modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In
both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than
larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties
commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call
for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often
incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOOCs缺乏学习者与教师之间的直接互动，且现有LLMs存在幻觉问题，限制了其可靠性。RAG虽能缓解问题，但受限于非结构化学习材料且无法主动引导学习者。

Method: 提出Graph RAG管道，利用EduKGs和PKGs：(1)基于PKG的问题生成方法推荐个性化问题；(2)基于EduKG的问题回答方法利用知识概念关系回答问题。

Result: 在CourseMapper平台上对3门MOOCs的专家评估显示，Graph RAG能有效支持学习者理解新知识概念。

Conclusion: Graph RAG为MOOCs中的个性化学习提供了潜力，帮助学习者更好地理解知识概念。

Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners
and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge
concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models
(LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to
hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a
response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by
unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not
actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these
challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational
Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide
learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.
Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to
recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an
EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between
knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To
evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3
different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the
evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand
new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大型语言模型（LLM）在代理系统中的性能，特别是解决小模型在复杂推理任务中的局限性。

Method: 提出Pre-Act方法，通过多步执行计划和逐步整合工具输出来优化代理性能，并微调小模型（如Llama 3.1）。

Result: Pre-Act在Almita数据集上比ReAct提升70%的动作召回率，微调的70B模型在动作准确性和目标完成率上分别优于GPT-4 69.5%和28%。

Conclusion: Pre-Act方法显著提升了代理系统的性能，尤其在任务导向场景中，同时通过微调小模型解决了实际应用中的成本与延迟问题。

Abstract: The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has
become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as
DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through
the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise
before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act,
a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step
execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This
plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining
itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our
approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To
measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a
two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our
turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach,
Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While
this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for
practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often
struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address
this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B &
70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the
fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action
accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate
(end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.

Conclusion: 该研究旨在推动个性化抑郁检测方法的发展，提升心理健康研究的包容性和准确性。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health issue affecting diverse age groups,
with notable prevalence among college students and the elderly. However,
existing datasets and detection methods primarily focus on young adults,
neglecting the broader age spectrum and individual differences that influence
depression manifestation. Current approaches often establish a direct mapping
between multimodal data and depression indicators, failing to capture the
complexity and diversity of depression across individuals. This challenge
includes two tracks based on age-specific subsets: Track 1 uses the
MPDD-Elderly dataset for detecting depression in older adults, and Track 2 uses
the MPDD-Young dataset for detecting depression in younger participants. The
Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection (MPDD) Challenge aims to
address this gap by incorporating multimodal data alongside individual
difference factors. We provide a baseline model that fuses audio and video
modalities with individual difference information to detect depression
manifestations in diverse populations. This challenge aims to promote the
development of more personalized and accurate de pression detection methods,
advancing mental health research and fostering inclusive detection systems.

Abstract: Taiwanese China Studies (CS) has developed into a rich, interdisciplinary
research field shaped by the unique geopolitical position and long standing
academic engagement with Mainland China. This study responds to the growing
need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS
scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured
academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply
generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and
standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles
published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a
lightweight D3.js based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific
knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows
users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus,
revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters,
and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured
knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text
consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances
scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven
alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only
demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities
but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly
infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.

Result: 研究识别了最有效和有用的解释方式，以支持诊断决策过程。

Abstract: As the field of healthcare increasingly adopts artificial intelligence, it
becomes important to understand which types of explanations increase
transparency and empower users to develop confidence and trust in the
predictions made by machine learning (ML) systems. In shared decision-making
scenarios where doctors cooperate with ML systems to reach an appropriate
decision, establishing mutual trust is crucial. In this paper, we explore
different approaches to generating explanations in eXplainable AI (XAI) and
make their underlying arguments explicit so that they can be evaluated by
medical experts. In particular, we present the findings of a user study
conducted with physicians to investigate their perceptions of various types of
AI-generated explanations in the context of diagnostic decision support. The
study aims to identify the most effective and useful explanations that enhance
the diagnostic process. In the study, medical doctors filled out a survey to
assess different types of explanations. Further, an interview was carried out
post-survey to gain qualitative insights on the requirements of explanations
incorporated in diagnostic decision support. Overall, the insights gained from
this study contribute to understanding the types of explanations that are most
effective.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent has gained significant attention for their potential in
simulation and enhancing performance. However, existing works are limited to
pure simulations or are constrained by predefined workflows, restricting their
applicability and effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent
Scaling Simulation (MASS) for portfolio construction. MASS achieves stable and
continuous excess returns by progressively increasing the number of agents for
large-scale simulations to gain a superior understanding of the market and
optimizing agent distribution end-to-end through a reverse optimization
process, rather than relying on a fixed workflow. We demonstrate its
superiority through performance experiments, ablation studies, backtesting
experiments, experiments on updated data and stock pools, scaling experiments,
parameter sensitivity experiments, and visualization experiments, conducted in
comparison with 6 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 challenging A-share stock
pools. We expect the paradigm established by MASS to expand to other tasks with
similar characteristics. The implementation of MASS has been open-sourced at

Abstract: The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working
conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However,
the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare
scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades,
with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).
SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last
decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to
outperform standard mathematical programming techniques.
  In this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a
wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints
are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective
state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired
rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for
certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the
problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs
better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set
of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted
during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the
generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and
experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based
methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of
personnel scheduling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个称为‘可塑性’的新概念，用于衡量代理如何被其观察所影响，并揭示了其与‘赋权’的基本联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨代理如何被其观察所影响，以及这种影响与赋权的关系，以更全面地理解代理的本质。

Method: 通过定义一个新的信息论量‘广义定向信息’来衡量可塑性，并验证其与赋权的对称关系。

Result: 发现可塑性是赋权的镜像，两者之间存在张力，代理设计需同时考虑这两者。

Conclusion: 可塑性、赋权及其关系是理解代理本质的关键因素。

Abstract: Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations
and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by
empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial
intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally
foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by
what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal
agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental
connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable
definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we
call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity
strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while
preserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that
plasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to
the empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding
establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent,
suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We
explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity,
empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解释评估方法依赖理想真实解释或模型敏感性，存在局限性，需要更独立和通用的评估策略。

Method: 提出AXE框架，基于三个原则设计，无需真实解释或模型敏感性，提供独立的质量评估。

Result: AXE与基线方法比较验证了其有效性，并能检测解释的公平性伪装。

Conclusion: AXE为解释评估提供了一种独立且通用的方法，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: There can be many competing and contradictory explanations for a single model
prediction, making it difficult to select which one to use. Current explanation
evaluation frameworks measure quality by comparing against ideal "ground-truth"
explanations, or by verifying model sensitivity to important inputs. We outline
the limitations of these approaches, and propose three desirable principles to
ground the future development of explanation evaluation strategies for local
feature importance explanations. We propose a ground-truth Agnostic eXplanation
Evaluation framework (AXE) for evaluating and comparing model explanations that
satisfies these principles. Unlike prior approaches, AXE does not require
access to ideal ground-truth explanations for comparison, or rely on model
sensitivity - providing an independent measure of explanation quality. We
verify AXE by comparing with baselines, and show how it can be used to detect
explanation fairwashing. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 为开发AI Agents和Agentic AI系统提供了明确的路线图。

Abstract: This study critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI,
offering a structured conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and challenge
analysis to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We
begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions,
characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation.
Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through
tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast,
Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent
collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated
autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution,
operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a
comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as
customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with
Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and
medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm
including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination
failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration
layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for
developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven
systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在动态环境中的自适应能力，发现大模型表现优于小模型，但策略性提示可以缩小差距。然而，高级提示技术对小模型更有效，且推理方法可能导致性能不稳定。与人类相比，模型在规划、推理和空间协调方面仍有明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在动态环境中作为自学习和推理代理的真正潜力，并评估其自适应能力。

Method: 通过自反思、启发式突变和规划等提示技术，在动态环境中测试不同开源语言模型的性能。

Result: 大模型表现更好，但策略提示可缩小差距；高级提示对小模型更有效；推理方法可能导致性能不稳定；模型在关键领域仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在规划和推理等方面仍有根本性不足，需超越静态基准以全面评估推理能力。

Abstract: While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static
benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and
reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of
agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math
word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important
shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move
beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

Motivation: 传统超声分析对左心房血流动力学的理解有限，4D Flow MRI虽有望改进，但低速度和分辨率限制以及缺乏专用框架阻碍了研究。

Method: 开发了首个开源计算框架，支持高质量自动分割和血流动力学参数分析，适用于不同来源的数据。

Conclusion: 该框架为左心房血流动力学研究提供了可靠工具，并展示了血流动力学参数作为预后生物标志物的潜力。

Abstract: The left atrium (LA) plays a pivotal role in modulating left ventricular
filling, but our comprehension of its hemodynamics is significantly limited by
the constraints of conventional ultrasound analysis. 4D flow magnetic resonance
imaging (4D Flow MRI) holds promise for enhancing our understanding of atrial
hemodynamics. However, the low velocities within the LA and the limited spatial
resolution of 4D Flow MRI make analyzing this chamber challenging. Furthermore,
the absence of dedicated computational frameworks, combined with diverse
acquisition protocols and vendors, complicates gathering large cohorts for
studying the prognostic value of hemodynamic parameters provided by 4D Flow
MRI. In this study, we introduce the first open-source computational framework
tailored for the analysis of 4D Flow MRI in the LA, enabling comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative analysis of advanced hemodynamic parameters. Our
framework proves robust to data from different centers of varying quality,
producing high-accuracy automated segmentations (Dice $>$ 0.9 and Hausdorff 95
$<$ 3 mm), even with limited training data. Additionally, we conducted the
first comprehensive assessment of energy, vorticity, and pressure parameters in
the LA across a spectrum of disorders to investigate their potential as
prognostic biomarkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法在生成长序列双人交互动作时表现不佳，主要受限于位置编码方案。

Method: 提出Dyadic Mamba，采用SSM架构，通过简单的序列拼接实现信息流动，避免复杂的跨注意力机制。

Result: 在短序列基准上表现优异，长序列生成显著优于Transformer方法，并提出了新的长序列评估基准。

Conclusion: SSM架构为长序列双人动作生成提供了有效解决方案，是未来研究的可行方向。

Abstract: Generating realistic dyadic human motion from text descriptions presents
significant challenges, particularly for extended interactions that exceed
typical training sequence lengths. While recent transformer-based approaches
have shown promising results for short-term dyadic motion synthesis, they
struggle with longer sequences due to inherent limitations in positional
encoding schemes. In this paper, we introduce Dyadic Mamba, a novel approach
that leverages State-Space Models (SSMs) to generate high-quality dyadic human
motion of arbitrary length. Our method employs a simple yet effective
architecture that facilitates information flow between individual motion
sequences through concatenation, eliminating the need for complex
cross-attention mechanisms. We demonstrate that Dyadic Mamba achieves
competitive performance on standard short-term benchmarks while significantly
outperforming transformer-based approaches on longer sequences. Additionally,
we propose a new benchmark for evaluating long-term motion synthesis quality,
providing a standardized framework for future research. Our results demonstrate
that SSM-based architectures offer a promising direction for addressing the
challenging task of long-term dyadic human motion synthesis from text
descriptions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需依赖未标注数据的医学图像分割方法BoundarySeg，通过多任务框架结合边界预测任务提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据获取和标注困难，半监督方法依赖未标注数据且效果受限。

Method: BoundarySeg框架将器官边界预测作为辅助任务，利用任务间一致性提供额外监督。

Result: 在低数据情况下表现优异，性能媲美或超越现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: BoundarySeg提供了一种高效且无需未标注数据的医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale medical data, annotated or unannotated, is challenging
due to stringent privacy regulations and data protection policies. In addition,
annotating medical images requires that domain experts manually delineate
anatomical structures, making the process both time-consuming and costly. As a
result, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity for reducing annotation
costs. However, the performance of semi-supervised methods is heavily dependent
on the availability of unannotated data, and their effectiveness declines when
such data are scarce or absent. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
simple, yet effective and computationally efficient approach for medical image
segmentation that leverages only existing annotations. We propose BoundarySeg ,
a multi-task framework that incorporates organ boundary prediction as an
auxiliary task to full organ segmentation, leveraging consistency between the
two task predictions to provide additional supervision. This strategy improves
segmentation accuracy, especially in low data regimes, allowing our method to
achieve performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art semi supervised
approaches all without relying on unannotated data or increasing computational
demands. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Computer-assisted interventions can improve intra-operative guidance,
particularly through deep learning methods that harness the spatiotemporal
information in surgical videos. However, the severe data imbalance often found
in surgical video datasets hinders the development of high-performing models.
In this work, we aim to overcome the data imbalance by synthesizing surgical
videos. We propose a unique two-stage, text-conditioned diffusion-based method
to generate high-fidelity surgical videos for under-represented classes. Our
approach conditions the generation process on text prompts and decouples
spatial and temporal modeling by utilizing a 2D latent diffusion model to
capture spatial content and then integrating temporal attention layers to
ensure temporal consistency. Furthermore, we introduce a rejection sampling
strategy to select the most suitable synthetic samples, effectively augmenting
existing datasets to address class imbalance. We evaluate our method on two
downstream tasks-surgical action recognition and intra-operative event
prediction-demonstrating that incorporating synthetic videos from our approach
substantially enhances model performance. We open-source our implementation at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率模式归纳（PSI）的原型模型，通过深度学习对少量结构化示例进行类比映射，形成组合概念。PSI在人类类似的学习表现上优于传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从有限示例中学习新视觉概念，传统模型无法捕捉结构化表示和类比映射的重要性。

Method: PSI结合对象级相似性和关系相似性，通过选择性注意机制放大分类相关关系。

Result: PSI在人类类似学习任务中表现优异，优于基于非结构化特征的传统模型。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和类比映射是快速学习组合视觉概念的关键，深度学习可助力心理学模型开发。

Abstract: The ability to learn new visual concepts from limited examples is a hallmark
of human cognition. While traditional category learning models represent each
example as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is
thought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed
graphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of
shared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,
we introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that
employs deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured
representations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept
called a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity
that weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a
mechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to
selective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces
human-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model
that uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,
and a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find
that PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that
increases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the
contribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that
structured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling
rapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how
deep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models.

Motivation: 现有基于NeRF和3DGS的视觉SLAM方法通常依赖RGBD传感器且仅适用于室内环境，大规模户外场景的鲁棒性重建尚未充分探索。

Method: LSG-SLAM采用多模态策略估计先验位姿，引入特征对齐扭曲约束优化跟踪，使用连续高斯泼溅子图处理无界场景，并通过渲染和特征扭曲损失优化闭环检测。

Result: 在EuRoc和KITTI数据集上的评估表明，LSG-SLAM性能优于现有神经、3DGS和传统方法。

Conclusion: LSG-SLAM通过多模态策略和子图优化，实现了大规模户外场景的高效鲁棒重建，为视觉SLAM提供了新思路。

Abstract: The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM.
However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only
available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in
large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a
large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The
proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses
under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping
constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in
rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce
continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited
memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the
relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and
feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and
Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction
quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM
achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even
traditional approaches. Project page: https://lsg-slam.github.io.

TL;DR: AdaptCLIP是一种简单有效的方法，通过交替学习视觉和文本表示，并结合上下文和对齐残差特征，显著提升了跨域异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在零样本或少样本异常检测中存在灵活性不足的问题，AdaptCLIP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AdaptCLIP通过添加三个简单适配器（视觉、文本和提示查询适配器）来改进CLIP模型，支持零/少样本跨域泛化。

Result: 在12个工业和医学领域的异常检测基准测试中，AdaptCLIP表现最优。

Conclusion: AdaptCLIP提供了一种无需目标域微调的高效跨域异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies from novel or
unseen vision domains without additional fine-tuning, which is critical in open
scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language
models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal
images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates,
complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in
limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method
called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual
representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second,
comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate
both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on
residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service,
adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and
prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports
zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free
manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial
and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods.
We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at

Result: 在跨模态腹部和心脏SFDA分割任务中，性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了域间隙问题，提升了SFDA的性能和效率。

Abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the challenge of model performance degradation
caused by domain gaps. In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,
labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are
used to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,
particularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As
a result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation
(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and
unlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA
methods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and
self-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target
domain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images
and pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.
Moreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under
limited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to
address these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of
domain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to
generate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model
and allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without
introducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent
frequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a
source-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related
layer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target
model using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels. Extensive
experiments on cross-modality abdominal and cardiac SFDA segmentation tasks
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: VRU-CIPI结合I2V通信可提前激活过街信号并提供预警，提升交叉路口安全性。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human behavior in-thewild, particularly at urban
intersections, remains crucial for enhancing interaction safety between road
users. Among the most critical behaviors are crossing intentions of Vulnerable
Road Users (VRUs), where misinterpretation may result in dangerous conflicts
with oncoming vehicles. In this work, we propose the VRU-CIPI framework with a
sequential attention-based model designed to predict VRU crossing intentions at
intersections. VRU-CIPI employs Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture temporal
dynamics in VRU movements, combined with a multi-head Transformer
self-attention mechanism to encode contextual and spatial dependencies critical
for predicting crossing direction. Evaluated on UCF-VRU dataset, our proposed
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 96.45% and achieving
real-time inference speed reaching 33 frames per second. Furthermore, by
integrating with Infrastructure-to-Vehicles (I2V) communication, our approach
can proactively enhance intersection safety through timely activation of
crossing signals and providing early warnings to connected vehicles, ensuring
smoother and safer interactions for all road users.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel remote sensing change detection task,
non-registration change detection, to address the increasing number of
emergencies such as natural disasters, anthropogenic accidents, and military
strikes. First, in light of the limited discourse on the issue of
non-registration change detection, we systematically propose eight scenarios
that could arise in the real world and potentially contribute to the occurrence
of non-registration problems. Second, we develop distinct image transformation
schemes tailored to various scenarios to convert the available registration
change detection dataset into a non-registration version. Finally, we
demonstrate that non-registration change detection can cause catastrophic
damage to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: CSPENet通过轮廓感知和先验嵌入，显著提升了红外小目标检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a critical role in a wide range
of civilian and military applications. Existing methods suffer from
deficiencies in the localization of dim targets and the perception of contour
information under dense clutter environments, severely limiting their detection
performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a contour-aware and saliency
priors embedding network (CSPENet) for ISTD. We first design a
surround-convergent prior extraction module (SCPEM) that effectively captures
the intrinsic characteristic of target contour pixel gradients converging
toward their center. This module concurrently extracts two collaborative
priors: a boosted saliency prior for accurate target localization and
multi-scale structural priors for comprehensively enriching contour detail
representation. Building upon this, we propose a dual-branch priors embedding
architecture (DBPEA) that establishes differentiated feature fusion pathways,
embedding these two priors at optimal network positions to achieve performance
enhancement. Finally, we develop an attention-guided feature enhancement module
(AGFEM) to refine feature representations and improve saliency estimation
accuracy. Experimental results on public datasets NUDT-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and
NUAA-SIRST demonstrate that our CSPENet outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods in detection performance. The code is available at

Existing methods often struggle with longitudinal dependencies and structural
consistency in progressive disorders. To address these limitations, we
introduce MambaControl, a novel framework that integrates selective state-space
modelling with diffusion processes for high-fidelity prediction of medical
image trajectories. To better capture subtle structural changes over time while

long-range modelling with graph-guided anatomical control to more effectively
represent anatomical correlations. Furthermore, we introduce Fourier-enhanced
spectral graph representations to capture spatial coherence and multiscale
detail, enabling MambaControl to achieve state-of-the-art performance in
Alzheimer's disease prediction. Quantitative and regional evaluations
demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity,
highlighting its potential for personalised prognosis and clinical decision

Result: 在RAF-DB和KDEF数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TKDF的引入显著提升了FER的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild remains a challenging task
due to the subtle and localized nature of expression-related features, as well
as the complex variations in facial appearance. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework that explicitly focuses on Texture Key Driver Factors (TKDF),
localized texture regions that exhibit strong discriminative power across
emotional categories. By carefully observing facial image patterns, we identify
that certain texture cues, such as micro-changes in skin around the brows,
eyes, and mouth, serve as primary indicators of emotional dynamics. To
effectively capture and leverage these cues, we propose a FER architecture
comprising a Texture-Aware Feature Extractor (TAFE) and Dual Contextual
Information Filtering (DCIF). TAFE employs a ResNet-based backbone enhanced
with multi-branch attention to extract fine-grained texture representations,
while DCIF refines these features by filtering context through adaptive pooling
and attention mechanisms. Experimental results on RAF-DB and KDEF datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, verifying
the effectiveness and robustness of incorporating TKDFs into FER pipelines.

TL;DR: APCoTTA是一种针对ALS点云语义分割的连续测试时间适应方法，通过动态选择可训练层、熵一致性损失和随机参数插值，解决了领域偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，并在两个新基准上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ALS点云分割中因环境、传感器变化导致的模型性能下降问题，填补CTTA在该领域的研究空白。

Method: 提出动态可训练层选择模块、熵一致性损失和随机参数插值机制，平衡目标适应和源知识保留。

Result: 在ISPRSC和H3DC基准上，mIoU分别提升约9%和14%。

Conclusion: APCoTTA有效解决了ALS点云分割中的CTTA挑战，并提供了新的基准和开源代码。

Abstract: Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task
for large-scale 3D scene understanding. In real-world applications, models are
typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the
environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in
model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by
adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.
Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing
challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of
catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To
tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for
ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer
selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select
low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we
propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on
entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing
model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation
mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers
with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation
and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we
construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA
benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate
that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU
improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference. The new
benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水下图像压缩算法未能充分利用水下场景的独特性，导致性能不佳。

Method: HQUIC采用ALTC模块预测衰减系数和全局光信息，结合辅助分支提取常见对象，并动态加权多尺度频率分量。

Result: 在多种水下数据集上，HQUIC优于现有压缩方法。

Conclusion: HQUIC通过针对性设计，显著提升了水下图像压缩的性能。

Abstract: With the increasing exploration and exploitation of the underwater world,
underwater images have become a critical medium for human interaction with
marine environments, driving extensive research into their efficient
transmission and storage. However, contemporary underwater image compression
algorithms fail to fully leverage the unique characteristics distinguishing
underwater scenes from terrestrial images, resulting in suboptimal performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce HQUIC, designed to exploit
underwater-image-specific features for enhanced compression efficiency. HQUIC
employs an ALTC module to adaptively predict the attenuation coefficients and
global light information of the images, which effectively mitigates the issues
caused by the differences in lighting and tone existing in underwater images.
Subsequently, HQUIC employs a codebook as an auxiliary branch to extract the
common objects within underwater images and enhances the performance of the
main branch. Furthermore, HQUIC dynamically weights multi-scale frequency
components, prioritizing information critical for distortion quality while
discarding redundant details. Extensive evaluations on diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate that HQUIC outperforms state-of-the-art compression
methods.

TL;DR: PointArena是一个评估多模态指向能力的综合平台，包含数据集、交互式竞技场和机器人系统，用于测试模型在多样化推理场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指向是语言与视觉场景结合的基础机制，现有基准仅关注对象定位任务，缺乏对多样化推理场景的支持。

Method: PointArena包括Point-Bench数据集、Point-Battle交互竞技场和Point-Act机器人系统，用于多阶段评估多模态模型的指向能力。

Result: Molmo-72B表现最佳，专有模型性能接近；针对指向任务的监督训练显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 精确的指向能力对多模态模型连接抽象推理与具体行动至关重要，PointArena为评估提供了全面工具。

Abstract: Pointing serves as a fundamental and intuitive mechanism for grounding
language within visual contexts, with applications spanning robotics, assistive
technologies, and interactive AI systems. While recent multimodal models have
started to support pointing capabilities, existing benchmarks typically focus
only on referential object localization tasks. We introduce PointArena, a
comprehensive platform for evaluating multimodal pointing across diverse
reasoning scenarios. PointArena comprises three components: (1) Point-Bench, a
curated dataset containing approximately 1,000 pointing tasks across five
reasoning categories; (2) Point-Battle, an interactive, web-based arena
facilitating blind, pairwise model comparisons, which has already gathered over
4,500 anonymized votes; and (3) Point-Act, a real-world robotic manipulation
system allowing users to directly evaluate multimodal model pointing
capabilities in practical settings. We conducted extensive evaluations of both
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary multimodal models. Results
indicate that Molmo-72B consistently outperforms other models, though
proprietary models increasingly demonstrate comparable performance.
Additionally, we find that supervised training specifically targeting pointing
tasks significantly enhances model performance. Across our multi-stage
evaluation pipeline, we also observe strong correlations, underscoring the
critical role of precise pointing capabilities in enabling multimodal models to
effectively bridge abstract reasoning with concrete, real-world actions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种描述性图像-文本匹配方法（DITM），通过探索语言的描述灵活性学习图像与文本之间的分级上下文相似性，解决了现有方法中稀疏二元监督的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用稀疏二元监督，仅覆盖有限的图像-文本关系，忽略了其固有的多对多对应关系以及从通用到特定描述的隐含联系。

Method: DITM通过计算句子的描述性分数（基于TF-IDF）动态调整正负对之间的连接性，并在通用到特定的顺序中对齐相关句子。

Result: 在MS-COCO、Flickr30K和CxC数据集上的实验表明，DITM在表示复杂图像-文本关系方面优于现有方法，并增强了模型的层次推理能力。

Conclusion: DITM通过超越刚性二元监督，提升了匹配的精确性和潜在正对的发现能力。

Abstract: Image-text matching aims to build correspondences between visual and textual
data by learning their pairwise similarities. Most existing approaches have
adopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and
sentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited
subset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many
correspondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different
descriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit
connections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying
rationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In
this work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn
the graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the
descriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of
each sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency
(TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the
sentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust
image-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling,
dynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and
(2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a
generic-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM
enhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs.
Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, DITM enhances the
hierarchical reasoning ability of the model, supported by the extensive
analysis on HierarCaps benchmark.

Abstract: In the era of immersive consumer electronics, such as AR/VR headsets and
smart devices, people increasingly seek ways to express their identity through
virtual fashion. However, existing 3D garment design tools remain inaccessible
to everyday users due to steep technical barriers and limited data. In this
work, we introduce a 3D sketch-driven 3D garment generation framework that
empowers ordinary users - even those without design experience - to create
high-quality digital clothing through simple 3D sketches in AR/VR environments.
By combining a conditional diffusion model, a sketch encoder trained in a
shared latent space, and an adaptive curriculum learning strategy, our system
interprets imprecise, free-hand input and produces realistic, personalized
garments. To address the scarcity of training data, we also introduce
KO3DClothes, a new dataset of paired 3D garments and user-created sketches.
Extensive experiments and user studies confirm that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in both fidelity and usability, demonstrating
its promise for democratized fashion design on next-generation consumer
platforms.

Object detection serves as a cornerstone of autonomous systems, playing a vital
role in enhancing driving safety, enabling autonomous functionality, improving

current technologies such as radar for environmental perception, cameras for
road perception, and vehicle sensor networks face notable challenges, including

reparameterization technology, a bidirectional pyramid structure network model,
and a novel detection pipeline into the YOLOv8 framework, the proposed approach
achieves highly efficient and precise detection of multi-scale, small, and

effectively detect both large and small objects with a detection accuracy of
65%, showcasing significant advancements over traditional methods.This improved
model holds substantial potential for real-world applications and is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有一次性学习方法在单领域表现良好，但在多领域无标签数据中受领域偏好影响，且对次优标注图像不鲁棒。

Method: UOD包含两阶段模型：第一阶段通过自监督学习生成伪标签；第二阶段设计领域自适应Transformer消除领域偏好并构建全局上下文。

Result: 在三个X-ray数据集（头、手、胸部）上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: UOD通过领域共享模块聚合多领域样本，显著提升了一次性标志物检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: One-shot medical landmark detection gains much attention and achieves great
success for its label-efficient training process. However, existing one-shot
learning methods are highly specialized in a single domain and suffer domain
preference heavily in the situation of multi-domain unlabeled data. Moreover,
one-shot learning is not robust that it faces performance drop when annotating
a sub-optimal image. To tackle these issues, we resort to developing a
domain-adaptive one-shot landmark detection framework for handling multi-domain
medical images, named Universal One-shot Detection (UOD). UOD consists of two
stages and two corresponding universal models which are designed as
combinations of domain-specific modules and domain-shared modules. In the first
stage, a domain-adaptive convolution model is self-supervised learned to
generate pseudo landmark labels. In the second stage, we design a
domain-adaptive transformer to eliminate domain preference and build the global
context for multi-domain data. Even though only one annotated sample from each
domain is available for training, the domain-shared modules help UOD aggregate
all one-shot samples to detect more robust and accurate landmarks. We
investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively the proposed UOD on three
widely-used public X-ray datasets in different anatomical domains (i.e., head,
hand, chest) and obtained state-of-the-art performances in each domain. The
code is available at

Abstract: This paper does not describe a new method; instead, it provides a thorough
exploration of an important yet understudied design space related to recent
advances in text-to-image synthesis -- specifically, the deep fusion of large
language models (LLMs) and diffusion transformers (DiTs) for multi-modal
generation. Previous studies mainly focused on overall system performance
rather than detailed comparisons with alternative methods, and key design

conduct an empirical study on text-to-image generation, performing controlled

providing a clear, reproducible recipe for training at scale. We hope this work
offers meaningful data points and practical guidelines for future research in
multi-modal generation.

Abstract: Dynamic scene representation and reconstruction have undergone transformative
advances in recent years, catalyzed by breakthroughs in neural radiance fields
and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. While initially developed for static
environments, these methodologies have rapidly evolved to address the
complexities inherent in 4D dynamic scenes through an expansive body of
research. Coupled with innovations in differentiable volumetric rendering,
these approaches have significantly enhanced the quality of motion
representation and dynamic scene reconstruction, thereby garnering substantial
attention from the computer vision and graphics communities. This survey
presents a systematic analysis of over 200 papers focused on dynamic scene
representation using radiance field, spanning the spectrum from implicit neural
representations to explicit Gaussian primitives. We categorize and evaluate
these works through multiple critical lenses: motion representation paradigms,
reconstruction techniques for varied scene dynamics, auxiliary information
integration strategies, and regularization approaches that ensure temporal
consistency and physical plausibility. We organize diverse methodological
approaches under a unified representational framework, concluding with a
critical examination of persistent challenges and promising research
directions. By providing this comprehensive overview, we aim to establish a
definitive reference for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field while
offering experienced practitioners a systematic understanding of both
conceptual principles and practical frontiers in dynamic scene reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 普什图语的NLP面临脚本复杂和数据集稀缺的挑战，需要开发专用数据集和评估模型性能。

Method: 开发了包含100万图像的合成数据集PsOCR，并基于不同架构（如CNN和Transformer）评估了多种LMMs。

Result: Gemini在闭源模型中表现最佳，而Qwen-7B在开源模型中表现突出。

Conclusion: 本研究为普什图语OCR任务提供了基准，并为类似脚本（如阿拉伯语、波斯语和乌尔都语）的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the low-resource Pashto language.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Pashto faces several challenges due to the
cursive nature of its script and a scarcity of structured datasets. To address
this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one
million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document
levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different
architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.
PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes,
and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the
performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's
Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four
closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results
demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas
among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful
assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in
Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR
but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. PsOCR is
available at https://github.com/zirak-ai/PashtoOCR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonifyGB是一个两阶段框架，用于从单目视频生成多样化的风格化3D头部头像。第一阶段通过改进的StyleGAN生成风格化视频，第二阶段利用高斯混合形状合成风格化头像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Toonify框架，使其能够合成多样化的风格化3D头部头像，克服固定分辨率裁剪的限制。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 改进的StyleGAN生成风格化视频；2) 高斯混合形状学习中性头部模型和表情混合形状。

Result: 在Arcane和Pixar风格上验证了ToonifyGB的有效性，能够高效渲染任意表情的风格化头像。

Conclusion: ToonifyGB成功实现了高质量、多样化的风格化3D头部头像生成。

Abstract: The introduction of 3D Gaussian blendshapes has enabled the real-time
reconstruction of animatable head avatars from monocular video. Toonify, a
StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization.
To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using
Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB.
In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to
generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the
limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for
normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables
Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video
frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In
Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head
model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By
combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can
efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the
effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane
and Pixar.

### [62] [MMRL++: Parameter-Efficient and Interaction-Aware Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10088)
*Yuncheng Guo,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态表示学习方法（MMRL），通过共享、可学习的模态无关表示空间，解决了大规模预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）在少样本数据下容易过拟合的问题，并进一步提出了参数高效的扩展版本MMRL++。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练的视觉语言模型在少样本数据下容易过拟合，导致泛化能力下降。

Method: MMRL引入模态无关的表示空间，生成空间令牌并投影到文本和图像编码器中，同时优化类别和表示特征。MMRL++进一步减少可训练参数并增强模态内交互。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，MMRL和MMRL++在任务特定适应和泛化之间取得了良好平衡，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMRL和MMRL++通过改进表示学习和参数效率，显著提升了少样本学习中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly
advanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models
with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their
ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal
Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,
modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected
into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more
effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize
class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder
layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving
general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and
representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is
applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection
layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To
further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning
class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,
a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base
tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger
generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient
and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters
and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of
representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific
information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive
experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently
outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between
task-specific adaptation and generalization.

*Yangfu Li,Hongjian Zhan,Tianyi Chen,Qi Liu,Yue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoB提出了一种多目标平衡覆盖方法，通过动态权衡视觉标记剪枝中的目标，显著提升了性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉标记剪枝方法采用静态策略，忽略了任务间目标重要性的变化，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 基于Hausdorff距离推导误差界，利用ε-覆盖理论揭示目标间的内在权衡，提出MoB框架，将剪枝问题转化为双目标覆盖问题。

Result: MoB仅用11.1%的原始视觉标记保留了96.4%的性能，加速LLaVA-Next-7B 1.3-1.5倍，性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: MoB在多种MLLM和视觉语言任务中表现优异，具有线性可扩展性和理论性能保证。

Abstract: Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual
preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative
importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent
performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for
visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing
the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\epsilon$-covering
theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify
their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle
this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which
reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this
framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy
radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability
with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to
challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves
96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual
tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\times$ with negligible
performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm
that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language
tasks.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在4D-CT图像重建中因不规则呼吸、滞后效应和呼吸信号与内部运动相关性差导致的伪影问题。

Method: 使用条件U-Net架构，充分利用条件信息，无需固定图像，应用于4D-CT数据中的肿瘤运动估计。

Result: 在临床4D-CT数据上实现了无伪影的实时重建，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂运动条件下的图像配准问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a novel image registration formalism dedicated to
the estimation of unknown condition-related images, based on two or more known
images and their associated conditions. We show how to practically model this
formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into
account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our
formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at
different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal
regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to
stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at
different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then
generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to
irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing
signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase
artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/Kheil-Z/IMITATE .

Result: 在多个域泛化数据集上显著优于现有联邦域泛化方法。

Conclusion: MCSAD通过协作风格增强和域不变学习，有效提升了模型在未见目标域上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from
multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target
domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain
generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore
the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style
information across existing source domains under the data decentralization
scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose
a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning
method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a
multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the
broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between
the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within
the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different
classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting
collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can
generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple
domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.

Abstract: Location Intelligence (LI), the science of transforming location-centric
geospatial data into actionable knowledge, has become a cornerstone of modern
spatial decision-making. The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation
Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive
technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging
large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have
demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured
geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent
integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal
geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey
presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across
both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on
the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological
perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current
advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future
research directions in the LLM era. This work offers a thorough exploration of
the field and providing a roadmap for further innovation in LI. The summary of
the up-to-date paper list can be found in

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新架构，通过少量数据集特定参数解决跨数据集显著性预测的泛化问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性预测模型在跨数据集时性能显著下降，主要由于数据集偏差，需解决泛化问题。

Method: 扩展编码器-解码器结构，引入少于20个数据集特定参数，控制多尺度结构、中心偏差和注视扩散等机制。

Result: 模型在MIT/Tuebingen显著性基准测试中达到新SOTA，泛化性能提升75%，仅需50样本即可显著改进。

Conclusion: 新架构有效解决了跨数据集泛化问题，同时揭示了空间显著性的复杂多尺度效应。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold
standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we
show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains
challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around
40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly,
increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with
close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining
generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly
dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific
parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure,
center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data
accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of
the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark
(MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from
unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the
respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into
spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine
both absolute and relative sizes.

Motivation: 当前食物体积估计方法受限于单核数据、专用硬件或依赖参考物，亟需一种更灵活、准确的解决方案。

Method: 利用AR移动设备捕获图像和相机位置，通过食物视频分割生成食物掩模，实现无参考和深度信息的3D重建。

Result: VolE在多个数据集上表现优异，平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）为2.22%。

Conclusion: VolE为食物体积估计提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，适用于医疗营养管理和健康监测。

Abstract: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for medical nutrition management
and health monitoring applications, but current food volume estimation methods
are often limited by mononuclear data, leveraging single-purpose hardware such
as 3D scanners, gathering sensor-oriented information such as depth
information, or relying on camera calibration using a reference object. In this
paper, we present VolE, a novel framework that leverages mobile device-driven
3D reconstruction to estimate food volume. VolE captures images and camera
locations in free motion to generate precise 3D models, thanks to AR-capable
mobile devices. To achieve real-world measurement, VolE is a reference- and
depth-free framework that leverages food video segmentation for food mask
generation. We also introduce a new food dataset encompassing the challenging
scenarios absent in the previous benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
VolE outperforms the existing volume estimation techniques across multiple
datasets by achieving 2.22 % MAPE, highlighting its superior performance in
food volume estimation.

Conclusion: 将MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强集成到nnU-Net训练流程中，为提升医学分割模型在真实场景中的可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets,
leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical
settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data
augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges,
traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness
needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically
evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary
Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations
without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We
demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution
generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of
transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We
quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature
representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we
highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an
easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical
segmentation models in real-world applications.

Result: 实验显示MTVCrafter在FID-VID指标上达到6.98，优于第二名65%，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: MTVCrafter为姿态引导的人类视频生成开辟了新方向，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly
due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely
largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits
generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.
To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video
Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences
(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT
(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.
Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust
spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image
and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we
introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention
with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as
4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D
world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new
direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our
MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,
surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter
also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple,
full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios. Our video demos and code

Conclusion: ADHMR通过偏好优化显著提升了人类网格恢复的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single image is inherently ill-posed due to
depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods have tried to solve this
by generating numerous plausible 3D human mesh predictions, but they often
exhibit misalignment with 2D image observations and weak robustness to
in-the-wild images. To address these issues, we propose ADHMR, a framework that
Aligns a Diffusion-based HMR model in a preference optimization manner. First,
we train a human mesh prediction assessment model, HMR-Scorer, capable of
evaluating predictions even for in-the-wild images without 3D annotations. We
then use HMR-Scorer to create a preference dataset, where each input image has
a pair of winner and loser mesh predictions. This dataset is used to finetune
the base model using direct preference optimization. Moreover, HMR-Scorer also
helps improve existing HMR models by data cleaning, even with fewer training
samples. Extensive experiments show that ADHMR outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at:

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps offer extensive and accurate environmental
information about the driving scene, making them a crucial and essential
element for planning within autonomous driving systems. To avoid extensive
efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have
emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping,
ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance
has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding
temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose
a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used
by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data
from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a
comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike
traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while
remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art online mapping
approaches, achieving improved generalization to previously unseen environments
and sensor configurations. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets,

TL;DR: 本文提出了HandReader，包含三种架构（RGB、KP、RGB+KP），用于手语拼写识别，并在多个数据集上取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语拼写识别因快速手势动作而具有挑战性，现有方法在准确性上仍有提升空间。

Method: HandReader_RGB使用TSAM处理RGB特征；HandReader_KP利用TPE处理关键点；HandReader_RGB+KP结合两种模态。

Result: 在ChicagoFSWild、ChicagoFSWild+和Znaki数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HandReader模型高效且通用，Znaki数据集和预训练模型已公开。

Abstract: Fingerspelling is a significant component of Sign Language (SL), allowing the
interpretation of proper names, characterized by fast hand movements during
signing. Although previous works on fingerspelling recognition have focused on
processing the temporal dimension of videos, there remains room for improving
the accuracy of these approaches. This paper introduces HandReader, a group of
three architectures designed to address the fingerspelling recognition task.
HandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to
process RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important
sequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal
Pose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition
in a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution
layers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints
coordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint
encoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model
possesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the
ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets. Moreover, the models demonstrate
high performance on the first open dataset for Russian fingerspelling, Znaki,
presented in this paper. The Znaki dataset and HandReader pre-trained models
are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有海洋雾数据集局限于单一区域或卫星，无法全面评估模型性能或探索海洋雾特性。

Method: 构建了MFogHub数据集，整合了15个沿海雾区和6颗卫星的68,000多个高分辨率样本。

Result: 实验表明MFogHub能揭示模型泛化波动，并为针对性雾预测技术提供资源。

Conclusion: MFogHub推动了全球海洋雾动态的监测和科学理解，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning approaches for marine fog detection and forecasting have
outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating significant scientific and
practical importance. However, the limited availability of open-source datasets
remains a major challenge. Existing datasets, often focused on a single region
or satellite, restrict the ability to evaluate model performance across diverse
conditions and hinder the exploration of intrinsic marine fog characteristics.
To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MFogHub}, the first
multi-regional and multi-satellite dataset to integrate annotated marine fog
observations from 15 coastal fog-prone regions and six geostationary
satellites, comprising over 68,000 high-resolution samples. By encompassing
diverse regions and satellite perspectives, MFogHub facilitates rigorous
evaluation of both detection and forecasting methods under varying conditions.
Extensive experiments with 16 baseline models demonstrate that MFogHub can
reveal generalization fluctuations due to regional and satellite discrepancy,
while also serving as a valuable resource for the development of targeted and
scalable fog prediction techniques. Through MFogHub, we aim to advance both the
practical monitoring and scientific understanding of marine fog dynamics on a
global scale. The dataset and code are at

*Yue Wang,Shuai Xu,Xuelin Zhu,Yicong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段跨模态交互模型（MSCI），通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层信息，解决了现有方法在细粒度局部特征捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的CZSL方法在细粒度局部特征捕捉上存在局限性，需要改进。

Method: 设计了两个自适应聚合器，分别从低级和高级视觉特征中提取局部和全局信息，并通过分阶段交互机制将其融入文本表示。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上验证了模型的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: MSCI通过动态调整全局和局部信息的注意力权重，显著提升了模型对细粒度局部视觉信息的感知能力。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object
combinations by leveraging known combinations. Existing studies basically rely
on the cross-modal alignment capabilities of CLIP but tend to overlook its
limitations in capturing fine-grained local features, which arise from its
architectural and training paradigm. To address this issue, we propose a
Multi-Stage Cross-modal Interaction (MSCI) model that effectively explores and
utilizes intermediate-layer information from CLIP's visual encoder.
Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local
information from low-level visual features and integrate global information
from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are
progressively incorporated into textual representations through a
stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's
perception capability for fine-grained local visual information. Additionally,
MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual
information based on different combinations, as well as different elements
within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse
scenarios. Experiments on three widely used datasets fully validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Data and code are
available at https://github.com/ltpwy/MSCI.

TL;DR: 论文提出StoryReasoning数据集和Qwen Storyteller模型，通过视觉相似性和面部识别解决视觉叙事中的角色一致性和对象重识别问题，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事系统在跨帧保持角色一致性和正确关联动作与主体方面存在困难，导致引用幻觉。

Method: 使用StoryReasoning数据集（4,178个故事，52,016张电影图像），结合结构化场景分析和多帧关系建模，采用跨帧对象重识别、链式思维推理和视觉实体链接技术。

Result: 通过微调Qwen2.5-VL 7B模型，Qwen Storyteller将每故事的幻觉现象从4.06减少到3.56（-12.3%）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效减少了视觉叙事中的幻觉现象，提升了角色和对象的一致性。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across
frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to
referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of
characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose
StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie
images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story
maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly
modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations.
Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual
similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit
narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to
visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by
fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end
object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining
consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a
reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story when
compared to a non-fine-tuned model.

TL;DR: MIPHEI是一种基于U-Net和ViT的模型，用于从H&E图像预测mIF信号，实现细胞类型分类，性能优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决mIF因成本高未广泛临床使用的问题，通过H&E图像预测mIF信号，实现低成本细胞类型分析。

Method: 采用U-Net架构结合ViT编码器，训练于ORION数据集，验证于两个独立数据集。

Result: 在多个标记物上表现优异，如Pan-CK F1分数0.88，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MIPHEI为大规模H&E数据集的细胞类型分析提供了新方向，有助于研究细胞空间组织与患者预后的关系。

Abstract: Histopathological analysis is a cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, with
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining routinely acquired for every patient to
visualize cell morphology and tissue architecture. On the other hand, multiplex
immunofluorescence (mIF) enables more precise cell type identification via
proteomic markers, but has yet to achieve widespread clinical adoption due to
cost and logistical constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIPHEI
(Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E), a U-Net-inspired
architecture that integrates state-of-the-art ViT foundation models as encoders
to predict mIF signals from H&E images. MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of
markers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid),
epithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using
the publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from
colorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI
achieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of
0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20,
substantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random
classifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively
captures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue
context, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell
types. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis
of large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between
spatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.

Motivation: 自监督学习在利用无标签数据方面表现出潜力，但也面临隐私问题。论文旨在研究在更现实的攻击场景（黑盒系统）下，如何对自监督模型进行成员推理。

Method: 提出PartCrop方法，通过裁剪图像中的部分对象并查询其在表示空间中的响应，利用模型对训练数据的部分感知能力进行攻击。

Result: 实验证明PartCrop在不同训练协议和结构的自监督模型上具有有效性和泛化性。防御实验中，早期停止、差分隐私和裁剪尺度范围缩小均有效。

Conclusion: PartCrop是一种有效的成员推理方法，适用于多种自监督模型。论文还提出了改进版PartCrop-v2，并验证了防御方法的有效性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled
data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision.
In this paper, we perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models
in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are
unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system
in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be
trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image
modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a
unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the
shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the
training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to
query responses within the image in representation space. We conduct extensive
attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and
structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the
effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against
PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential
privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The
defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Finally, besides
prototype testing on toy visual encoders and small-scale image datasets, we
quantitatively study the impacts of scaling from both data and model aspects in
a realistic scenario and propose a scalable PartCrop-v2 by introducing two
structural improvements to PartCrop. Our code is at

TL;DR: SpikeVideoFormer是一种高效的脉冲驱动视频Transformer，通过设计脉冲驱动的Hamming注意力（SDHA）和优化的时空注意力方案，在视频任务中实现了线性时间复杂度和卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于SNN的Transformer主要关注单图像任务，未能充分利用SNN在视频任务中的效率优势。

Method: 设计脉冲驱动的Hamming注意力（SDHA），并分析多种脉冲驱动的时空注意力方案，选择最优方案。

Result: 在视频分类、人体姿态跟踪和语义分割任务中，性能优于现有SNN方法，提升超过15%，且效率显著优于ANN方法。

Conclusion: SpikeVideoFormer在保持线性时间复杂度的同时，实现了视频任务中的高效性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering
superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily
focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively
leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer,
featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design
a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided
adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention.
Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention
designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for
video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The
generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across
diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking,
and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with
over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the
performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency
gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the
three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发学习型ISP时，获取像素对齐的成对数据成本高且困难，因此需要一种无需成对数据的训练方法。

Method: 采用多损失函数和对抗训练，利用预训练网络的特征图指导学习，保持内容结构的同时学习目标RGB数据集的颜色和纹理特征。

Result: 在Zurich RAW to RGB和Fujifilm UltraISP数据集上评估，与成对训练方法相比，表现出高性能。

Conclusion: 无配对学习方法在移动设备上具有潜力，能够实现高质量图像转换。

Abstract: The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a fundamental component in modern
smartphone cameras responsible for conversion of RAW sensor image data to RGB
images with a strong focus on perceptual quality. Recent work highlights the
potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with
a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and
costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise
aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to
high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by
proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need
for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with
matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function
guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature
maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning
color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using
lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as
backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm
UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning
strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple
evaluation metrics. The code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）对图像中虚拟物体（未在图像中实际出现的物体）的理解能力，发现当前先进模型的处理能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否真正理解图像的视觉空间属性，尤其是对虚拟物体的处理能力。

Method: 通过设计包含虚拟物体的提示（如“想象风筝卡在树上”）来测试VLMs的场景理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前先进的VLMs对虚拟物体的处理能力不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在理解虚拟物体和空间关系方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are AI systems paired with both language and
vision encoders to process multimodal input. They are capable of performing
complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open
question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes
depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual
objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help
test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that
depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt:
imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should
update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations
between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of
state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is
inadequate.

TL;DR: ControlGS是一种3D高斯溅射优化方法，通过用户指定的超参数实现语义明确且跨场景一致的量化-质量控制，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D高斯溅射中缺乏用户直观调整量化-质量权衡的能力，无法适应多样化硬件和通信约束的实际需求。

Method: 通过单次训练和用户指定的超参数，ControlGS自动找到不同场景下的理想量化-质量权衡点。

Result: ControlGS在保持较少高斯数量的同时实现更高的渲染质量，并支持广泛的调整范围和无级控制。

Conclusion: ControlGS提供了一种灵活且高性能的量化-质量控制方法，适用于从紧凑对象到大型户外场景的多样化需求。

Abstract: To reduce storage and computational costs, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) seeks
to minimize the number of Gaussians used while preserving high rendering
quality, introducing an inherent trade-off between Gaussian quantity and
rendering quality. Existing methods strive for better quantity-quality
performance, but lack the ability for users to intuitively adjust this
trade-off to suit practical needs such as model deployment under diverse
hardware and communication constraints. Here, we present ControlGS, a 3DGS
optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene
consistent quantity-quality control while maintaining strong quantity-quality
performance. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a
user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS
can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across
diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also
outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer
Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the
trade-off.

Conclusion: Logos数据集和提出的方法有效解决了ISLR中的关键问题，为跨语言手语识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition
(ISLR) task. First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the
amount of data for most individual sign languages is limited. It poses the
challenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning.
Second, similar signs can have different semantic meanings. It leads to
ambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for
annotating such signs. To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a
novel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by
the number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the
largest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. It is shown that a model,
pre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other
language SLR tasks, including few-shot learning. We explore cross-language
transfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple
classification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the
most. The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually
similar sign groups. We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs
improves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks. Based
on the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results
for the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a
single stream model processing solely RGB video. The source code, dataset, and
pre-trained models are publicly available.

Result: UniBench更具挑战性，UniScore与人工评估一致，优于现有指标，并揭示了SoTA模型的独特价值。

Conclusion: UniEval为多模态模型提供了高效统一的评估工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of unified multimodal understanding and generation models is
rapidly attracting attention because of their ability to enhance
instruction-following capabilities while minimizing model redundancy. However,
there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would
enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct
evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant
limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation
models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity,
and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework
designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or
annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The
UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both
unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore
metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity.
Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing
benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing
current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual
generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.

Conclusion: CheXGenBench为医学AI社区提供了标准化基准，支持客观可重复的比较，并发布了高质量合成数据集SynthCheX-75K。

Abstract: We introduce CheXGenBench, a rigorous and multifaceted evaluation framework
for synthetic chest radiograph generation that simultaneously assesses
fidelity, privacy risks, and clinical utility across state-of-the-art
text-to-image generative models. Despite rapid advancements in generative AI
for real-world imagery, medical domain evaluations have been hindered by
methodological inconsistencies, outdated architectural comparisons, and
disconnected assessment criteria that rarely address the practical clinical
value of synthetic samples. CheXGenBench overcomes these limitations through
standardised data partitioning and a unified evaluation protocol comprising
over 20 quantitative metrics that systematically analyse generation quality,
potential privacy vulnerabilities, and downstream clinical applicability across
11 leading text-to-image architectures. Our results reveal critical
inefficiencies in the existing evaluation protocols, particularly in assessing
generative fidelity, leading to inconsistent and uninformative comparisons. Our
framework establishes a standardised benchmark for the medical AI community,
enabling objective and reproducible comparisons while facilitating seamless
integration of both existing and future generative models. Additionally, we
release a high-quality, synthetic dataset, SynthCheX-75K, comprising 75K
radiographs generated by the top-performing model (Sana 0.6B) in our benchmark
to support further research in this critical domain. Through CheXGenBench, we

Motivation: 随着深度学习技术的发展，人脸识别广泛应用，但也面临形态攻击等安全威胁，需提升系统鲁棒性。

Method: 通过双分支分类策略处理形态图像的标签模糊性，将其纳入训练过程。

Result: 在公共基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，提升了对抗形态攻击的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可集成到现有训练流程中，提升基于分类的识别方法。

Abstract: Face recognition has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep
learning techniques, enabling its widespread adoption in various applications
requiring secure authentication. However, this progress has also increased its
exposure to presentation attacks, including face morphing, which poses a
serious security threat by allowing one identity to impersonate another.
Therefore, modern face recognition systems must be robust against such attacks.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach for training deep networks for face
recognition with enhanced robustness to face morphing attacks. Our method
modifies the classification task by introducing a dual-branch classification
strategy that effectively handles the ambiguity in the labeling of face morphs.
This adaptation allows the model to incorporate morph images into the training
process, improving its ability to distinguish them from bona fide samples.
  Our strategy has been validated on public benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing robustness against face morphing attacks.
Furthermore, our approach is universally applicable and can be integrated into
existing face recognition training pipelines to improve classification-based
recognition methods.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved high performance in
vision-language tasks involving single image but they struggle when presented
with a collection of multiple images (Multiple Image Question Answering
scenario). These tasks, which involve reasoning over large number of images,
present issues in scalability (with increasing number of images) and retrieval
performance. In this work, we propose an enhancement for retriever framework
introduced in MIRAGE model using submodular subset selection techniques. Our
method leverages query-aware submodular functions, such as GraphCut, to
pre-select a subset of semantically relevant images before main retrieval
component. We demonstrate that using anchor-based queries and augmenting the
data improves submodular-retriever pipeline effectiveness, particularly in
large haystack sizes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过解耦视觉和文本模态的注意力机制，揭示了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在回答正确时可能并未真正理解视觉输入的问题，并提出了‘注意力准确性’这一新指标来量化此类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估答案正确性，忽视了模型是否真正理解视觉输入，因此需要一种更可靠的方法来评估模型的视觉理解能力。

Method: 通过分析因果注意力模块中视觉和文本模态的解耦，提出‘注意力准确性’作为评估指标，并设计了一个新的基准来量化隐式视觉误解（IVM）。

Result: 研究发现，随着网络层加深，注意力分布逐渐集中在与正确答案相关的图像上，验证了新指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅适用于多模态场景，还能扩展到单模态场景，展示了其通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models
genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit
visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without
fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the
visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing
that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with
the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the
introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a
novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the
model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to
positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our
approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal
scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了合成图像中可行性（feasibility）对CLIP分类器性能的影响，发现可行性对性能影响极小，且混合可行与不可行图像训练无明显差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成逼真图像的能力提升，合成数据训练模型的效果逐渐改善，但生成的图像可能存在不现实的属性（如狗漂浮在空中）。研究旨在验证合成数据中可行性是否对CLIP分类器性能有显著影响。

Method: 提出VariReal流程，通过最小化编辑源图像以生成可行或不可行属性的图像，并基于文本提示控制属性。实验在三个细粒度数据集上评估LoRA微调CLIP的性能。

Result: 可行性对CLIP分类器性能影响极小（差异<0.3%），且混合可行与不可行图像训练对性能无显著影响。某些属性可能对分类性能产生对抗性影响。

Conclusion: 合成数据中可行性对CLIP分类器性能影响有限，无需强制要求可行性，混合训练数据集是可行的选择。

Abstract: With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in
part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However,
diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in
reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture
artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a
synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic
images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered
infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered
out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a
model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be
excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility
really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is
necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,
focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We
introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to
include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated
by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally
affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference
in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute
matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the
classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in
training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using
purely feasible or infeasible datasets.

Abstract: Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large
Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate
details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving,
hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning.
To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal
alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate
corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two
modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset
with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model,
FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date.
Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures
and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math
instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with
ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on
MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a
new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista,
achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%. The dataset and models will be

TL;DR: ETT是一种端到端的视觉标记器调优方法，通过联合优化视觉标记化和目标自回归任务，显著提升了多模态理解和视觉生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉标记化方法将标记器优化与下游任务训练分离，导致视觉标记无法适应不同任务的需求，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: ETT利用视觉标记器的嵌入向量，通过重建和标题生成目标联合优化标记器，无需修改原始架构。

Result: 实验表明，ETT在多模态理解和视觉生成任务上比冻结标记器基线提升了2-6%的性能，同时保持了原始重建能力。

Conclusion: ETT是一种简单有效的方法，有望在多模态基础模型中广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers
from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize
well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question
answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is
agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.
This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the
vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For
example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when
recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end
vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision
tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive
models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT
leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the
vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.
ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal
architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate,
without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the
employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance
gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks
compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original
reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can
empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and
understanding.

Result: 在7个真实数据集上表现优异，支持零样本泛化，性能超越任务专用方法。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活高效，能适应不同MDE模型，为深度图生成提供新思路。

Abstract: This work presents Prior Depth Anything, a framework that combines incomplete
but precise metric information in depth measurement with relative but complete
geometric structures in depth prediction, generating accurate, dense, and
detailed metric depth maps for any scene. To this end, we design a
coarse-to-fine pipeline to progressively integrate the two complementary depth
sources. First, we introduce pixel-level metric alignment and distance-aware
weighting to pre-fill diverse metric priors by explicitly using depth
prediction. It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns,
enhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a
conditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise
of depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and
prediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth
sources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth
completion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets,
matching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly,
it performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time
improvements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像先验建模方面取得了进展，但基于单张图像的3D感知编辑仍然具有挑战性。

Result: 3D-Fixup能够实现复杂且身份一致的3D感知编辑，生成高质量结果。

Conclusion: 通过整合3D先验，3D-Fixup推动了扩散模型在真实图像操作中的应用。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models,
3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only
specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a
new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework
supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D
rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses
the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes
real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training
data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a
single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,
we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this
challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We
design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout
training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup
effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving
high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in
realistic image manipulation. The code is provided at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ANN-to-SNN转换方法在处理LLMs时存在激活异常和非线性操作不兼容的问题，LAS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LAS引入两种新型神经元，并定制了脉冲等效的Transformer组件，确保无损转换。

Result: 实验表明，LAS在六种语言模型和两种视觉语言模型上实现了无损转换，并在OPT-66B上提升了2%的准确率。

Conclusion: LAS是一种高效且无损的ANN-SNN转换方法，适用于LLMs。

Abstract: Spiking Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an energy-efficient
alternative to conventional LLMs through their event-driven computation. To
effectively obtain spiking LLMs, researchers develop different ANN-to-SNN
conversion methods by leveraging pre-trained ANN parameters while inheriting
the energy efficiency of SNN. However, existing conversion methods struggle
with extreme activation outliers and incompatible nonlinear operations of
ANN-based LLMs. To address this, we propose a loss-less ANN-SNN conversion for
fully spike-driven LLMs, termed LAS. Specifically, LAS introduces two novel
neurons to convert the activation outlier and nonlinear operation of ANN-based
LLMs. Moreover, LAS tailors the spike-equivalent Transformer components for
spiking LLMs, which can ensure full spiking conversion without any loss of
performance. Experimental results on six language models and two
vision-language models demonstrate that LAS achieves loss-less conversion.
Notably, on OPT-66B, LAS even improves the accuracy of 2\% on the WSC task. In
addition, the parameter and ablation studies further verify the effectiveness
of LAS. The source code is available at https://github.com/lc783/LAS

Method: 引入了一种鲁棒的方法，适配LLMs以应对模拟硬件的噪声和低精度限制，并展示了其在Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct和Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct等模型上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了高性能LLMs与高效模拟硬件之间的鸿沟，为能效优化的基础模型提供了路径。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve
speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of
conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces
fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on
input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions,
off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when
deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated
recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic
method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet
exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly
adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach
enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including
Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain
performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the
presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show
that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can
be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show
that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better
scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input
quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient
analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.

Conclusion: 这是首个结合社区结构、可迁移性和主动学习并具有理论保证的MARL框架。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community
structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed
interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and
abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple
overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value
functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized
membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this
structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and
value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring
access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both
transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation,
and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration.
Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function
approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the
first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and
active learning with provable guarantees.

Conclusion: FGU是一种有效的公平图遗忘方法，解决了偏见问题并保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph unlearning is a crucial approach for protecting user privacy by erasing
the influence of user data on trained graph models. Recent developments in
graph unlearning methods have primarily focused on maintaining model prediction
performance while removing user information. However, we have observed that
when user information is deleted from the model, the prediction distribution
across different sensitive groups often changes. Furthermore, graph models are
shown to be prone to amplifying biases, making the study of fairness in graph
unlearning particularly important. This raises the question: Does graph
unlearning actually introduce bias? Our findings indicate that the predictions
of post-unlearning models become highly correlated with sensitive attributes,
confirming the introduction of bias in the graph unlearning process. To address
this issue, we propose a fair graph unlearning method, FGU. To guarantee
privacy, FGU trains shard models on partitioned subgraphs, unlearns the
requested data from the corresponding subgraphs, and retrains the shard models
on the modified subgraphs. To ensure fairness, FGU employs a bi-level debiasing
process: it first enables shard-level fairness by incorporating a fairness
regularizer in the shard model retraining, and then achieves global-level
fairness by aligning all shard models to minimize global disparity. Our
experiments demonstrate that FGU achieves superior fairness while maintaining
privacy and accuracy. Additionally, FGU is robust to diverse unlearning
requests, ensuring fairness and utility performance across various data
distributions.

Abstract: While substantial research has been devoted to optimizing model performance,
convergence rates, and communication efficiency, the energy implications of
federated learning (FL) within Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
scenarios are often overlooked in the existing literature. This study examines
the energy consumed during the FL process, focusing on three main
energy-intensive processes: pre-processing, communication, and local learning,
all contributing to the overall energy footprint. We rely on the observation
that device/client selection is crucial for speeding up the convergence of
model training in a distributed AIoT setting and propose two
clustering-informed methods. These clustering solutions are designed to group
AIoT devices with similar label distributions, resulting in clusters composed
of nearly heterogeneous devices. Hence, our methods alleviate the heterogeneity
often encountered in real-world distributed learning applications. Throughout
extensive numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that our clustering
strategies typically achieve high convergence rates while maintaining low
energy consumption when compared to other recent approaches available in the
literature.

Abstract: As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more
capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling
technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and
decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many
scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization
imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While
more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for
homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper
introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the
challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge,
characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and
lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and
asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet
decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We
introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically
infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model
updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's
model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized
training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous
decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network
size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource
requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods
outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and
heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and
reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.

Abstract: We investigate deep morphological neural networks (DMNNs). We demonstrate
that despite their inherent non-linearity, activations between layers are
essential for DMNNs. We then propose several new architectures for DMNNs, each
with a different constraint on their parameters. For the first (resp. second)
architecture, we work under the constraint that the majority of parameters
(resp. learnable parameters) should be part of morphological operations. We
empirically show that our proposed networks can be successfully trained, and
are more prunable than linear networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to successfully train DMNNs under such constraints, although the
generalization capabilities of our networks remain limited. Finally, we propose
a hybrid network architecture combining linear and morphological layers,
showing empirically that the inclusion of morphological layers significantly
accelerates the convergence of gradient descent with large batches.

Method: 研究了两项明确OOD指标的任务，测试了MLP、CNN和Transformer的OOD表现，并开发了两种新型网络架构。

Result: 即使具备正确偏置和近乎完美的OOD性能，算法仍可能无法学习正确的组合特征。

Conclusion: 仅依赖OOD测试不足以验证组合泛化，需进一步确认特征的组合性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human
and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must
discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output
mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an
intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable
input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act
based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the
task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to
confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data,
it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm
that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by
exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable
by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop
two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be
successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost
perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct
features for compositional generalisation.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在保护数据隐私的同时进行协作模型训练，但数据质量问题（如噪声标签、类别缺失和不平衡分布）严重影响了其效果。

Method: 采用自适应噪声清理、协作条件GAN生成合成数据以及鲁棒的联邦模型训练，系统提升数据完整性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) presents an effective solution for collaborative
model training while maintaining data privacy across decentralized client
datasets. However, data quality issues such as noisy labels, missing classes,
and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This
study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses
data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The
proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise
cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and
robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on
benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant
improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under
varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed
framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial
performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices
while rigorously maintaining data privacy. Our results indicate that this
method effectively mitigates common data quality challenges, providing a
robust, scalable, and privacy compliant solution suitable for diverse
real-world federated learning scenarios.

Motivation: 解决多智能体多臂老虎机问题中最佳臂识别的挑战，同时最小化样本复杂性和通信开销。

Method: 提出两种算法：Cl-BAI（先聚类后识别最佳臂）和BAI-Cl（先识别最佳臂后聚类），均采用逐次消除框架。

Result: 两种算法均具有δ-PC保证，样本复杂度有界，且在小M情况下BAI-Cl变体在样本复杂度上达到极小极大最优。实验验证了算法在样本和通信效率上的优势。

Conclusion: Cl-BAI和BAI-Cl算法在多智能体多臂老虎机问题中表现优异，尤其适用于M远小于N的场景。

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of best arm identification for multi-agent
multi-armed bandits. We consider $N$ agents grouped into $M$ clusters, where
each cluster solves a stochastic bandit problem. The mapping between agents and
bandits is a priori unknown. Each bandit is associated with $K$ arms, and the
goal is to identify the best arm for each agent under a $\delta$-probably
correct ($\delta$-PC) framework, while minimizing sample complexity and
communication overhead.
  We propose two novel algorithms: Clustering then Best Arm Identification
(Cl-BAI) and Best Arm Identification then Clustering (BAI-Cl). Cl-BAI uses a
two-phase approach that first clusters agents based on the bandit problems they
are learning, followed by identifying the best arm for each cluster. BAI-Cl
reverses the sequence by identifying the best arms first and then clustering
agents accordingly. Both algorithms leverage the successive elimination
framework to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy.
  We establish $\delta$-PC guarantees for both methods, derive bounds on their
sample complexity, and provide a lower bound for this problem class. Moreover,
when $M$ is small (a constant), we show that the sample complexity of a variant
of BAI-Cl is minimax optimal in an order-wise sense. Experiments on synthetic
and real-world datasets (MovieLens, Yelp) demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed algorithms in terms of sample and communication efficiency,
particularly in settings where $M \ll N$.

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习能量分布结构，有效提升样本效率和全局优化能力，适用于不同查询成本的场景。

Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial
optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP
problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the
black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model
the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the
network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high
temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low
temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and
facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the
temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and
improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard,
the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the
black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under
both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance
against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have made it increasingly difficult to
distinguish real data from model-generated synthetic data. Using synthetic data
for successive training of future model generations creates "self-consuming
loops", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore,
synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on
their preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is
curated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop
drives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those
preferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or
adversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit
malicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this
paper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining
loops with noisy and adversarially curated data. We theoretically analyze the
impact of such noisy data curation on generative models and identify conditions
for the robustness of the retraining process. Building on this analysis, we
design attack algorithms for competitive adversarial scenarios, where a
platform with a limited budget employs malicious users to misalign a rival's
model from actual user preferences. Experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Motivation: 在LLM训练中，检查点数据量庞大且需频繁存储，现有压缩方法效率不足，影响训练效率。

Method: 分析检查点数据的可压缩性，结合字节分组和增量差分压缩技术，开发基于字节分组和霍夫曼编码的LMC压缩方案。

Result: LMC在压缩性能上优于BZ2，且压缩时间大幅减少，16核并行实现压缩和解压吞吐量分别达2.78 GiB/s和3.76 GiB/s。

Conclusion: LMC显著提升检查点数据压缩效率，降低资源占用，支持更高频率的检查点操作。

Abstract: During the training of Large Language Models (LLMs), tensor data is
periodically "checkpointed" to persistent storage to allow recovery of work
done in the event of failure. The volume of data that must be copied during
each checkpoint, even when using reduced-precision representations such as
bfloat16, often reaches hundreds of gigabytes. Furthermore, the data must be
moved across a network and written to a storage system before the next epoch
occurs. With a view to ultimately building an optimized checkpointing solution,
this paper presents experimental analysis of checkpoint data used to derive a
design that maximizes the use of lossless compression to reduce the volume of
data. We examine how tensor data and its compressibility evolve during model
training and evaluate the efficacy of existing common off-the-shelf general
purpose compression engines combined with known data optimization techniques
such as byte-grouping and incremental delta compression.
  Leveraging our analysis we have built an effective compression solution,
known as Language Model Compressor (LMC), which is based on byte-grouping and
Huffman encoding. LMC offers more compression performance than the best
alternative (BZ2) but with an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time needed
to perform the compression. We show that a 16-core parallel implementation of
LMC can attain compression and decompression throughput of 2.78 GiB/s and 3.76
GiB/s respectively. This increase in performance ultimately reduces the CPU
resources needed and provides more time to copy the data to the storage system
before the next epoch thus allowing for higher-frequency checkpoints.

Abstract: Stroke remains one of the most critical global health challenges, ranking as
the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability
worldwide. This study explores the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms
in predicting stroke risk using demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data from
the Stroke Prediction Dataset. By addressing key methodological challenges such

demonstrate that while these models achieve high accuracy, sensitivity remains
a limiting factor for real-world clinical applications. In addition, we
identify the most influential predictive features and propose strategies to
improve machine learning-based stroke prediction. These findings contribute to
the development of more reliable and interpretable models for the early
assessment of stroke risk.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them
systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full
potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search
for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to
optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's
vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be
inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections
to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully
utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an
intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the
Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always
stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique
and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several
widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using
five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that
the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to
three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques. The source code for our
implementation is available at:

Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal
processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean
domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are
unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing
interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across
different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are
still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth
signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product
models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder
constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,
we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide
theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm
is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's
efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in
classification problems - have long been essential tools for quantifying
uncertainty and disorder in data and developing artificial intelligence
algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has
introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous
datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory
into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more
effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a
zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy
and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of
multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture
to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse
datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and
energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization
capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives.
As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy
landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material
behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the
temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for
data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as
a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems
involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.

Motivation: 理解Transformer模型中IWL（权重内学习）和ICL（上下文学习）的交互机制，借鉴进化生物学的理论框架，探索环境可预测性如何影响这两种学习模式的平衡。

Method: 通过回归和分类任务实验，操作化环境稳定性和线索可靠性，系统分析其对IWL和ICL选择的影响。

Result: 高环境稳定性显著偏好IWL，而高线索可靠性增强ICL效果；学习动态显示任务依赖性，部分场景出现ICL到IWL的转变，其他场景则相反。

Conclusion: 可预测性是决定Transformer学习模式选择的关键因素，研究结果为理解ICL和优化训练方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL),
encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting
flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the
interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary
biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,
adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and
phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to
environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability
dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic
encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We
experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and
systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in
Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high
environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp
transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL
efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics
reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift
occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we
demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL
acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding
to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for
explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a
critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering
novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.

Conclusion: KQT-EWMA是一种高效且灵活的非参数化变化检测方法。

Abstract: We present Kernel-QuantTree Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (KQT-EWMA),
a non-parametric change-detection algorithm that combines the Kernel-QuantTree
(KQT) histogram and the EWMA statistic to monitor multivariate data streams
online. The resulting monitoring scheme is very flexible, since histograms can
be used to model any stationary distribution, and practical, since the
distribution of test statistics does not depend on the distribution of
datastream in stationary conditions (non-parametric monitoring). KQT-EWMA
enables controlling false alarms by operating at a pre-determined Average Run
Length ($ARL_0$), which measures the expected number of stationary samples to
be monitored before triggering a false alarm. The latter peculiarity is in
contrast with most non-parametric change-detection tests, which rarely can
control the $ARL_0$ a priori. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that KQT-EWMA can control $ARL_0$ while achieving
detection delays comparable to or lower than state-of-the-art methods designed
to work in the same conditions.

Result: BINGO提供了一种计算效率高且准确性保持的剪枝技术。

Conclusion: BINGO为AI发展提供了一种更可持续的路径，避免了模型规模的无限制增长。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning has increased
exponentially. Models are far more complex than ever before, growing to
gargantuan sizes and housing millions of weights. Unfortunately, the fact that
large models have become the state of the art means that it often costs
millions of dollars to train and operate them. These expenses not only hurt
companies but also bar non-wealthy individuals from contributing to new
developments and force consumers to pay greater prices for AI. Current methods
used to prune models, such as iterative magnitude pruning, have shown great
accuracy but require an iterative training sequence that is incredibly
computationally and environmentally taxing. To solve this problem, BINGO is
introduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a
neural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight
plays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done,
BINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for
insignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an
accuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive
than current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to
mean model growth, as well.

Abstract: The introduction of multimodal models is a huge step forward in Artificial
Intelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities:
text, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these
breakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of
adversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit
vulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat
amplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or
across these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types
remains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners
adopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications,
it's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive
actions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial
attacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This
survey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how
multimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the
multimodal world.

*Ziyuan Zhang,Darcy Wang,Ningyuan Chen,Rodrigo Mansur,Vahid Sarhangian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在探索-利用权衡（E&E）任务中的决策行为，并与人类和多臂老虎机（MAB）算法进行比较。研究发现，推理能力使LLMs更接近人类行为，但在复杂环境中适应性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能在复杂决策任务中模拟或超越人类行为，特别是在探索-利用权衡这一核心问题上。

Method: 使用多臂老虎机任务和可解释的选择模型，比较LLMs、人类和MAB算法的E&E策略，并分析推理（如提示策略和增强推理模型）对LLM决策的影响。

Result: 推理使LLMs更接近人类行为，表现为随机和定向探索的混合。在简单任务中表现相似，但在复杂环境中LLMs适应性较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类行为和自动化决策方面有潜力，但在复杂环境中的适应性仍需改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate
human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question
is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and
can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the
exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic
decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB)
tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct
a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms.
We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents
and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and
reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning
shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random
and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs
exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans.
However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match
human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite
achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the
promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for
automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 哈斯鳄梨价格受多种因素影响，传统模型难以处理非线性动态数据，需更有效的预测方法。

Method: 采用TCN-MLP-Attention架构，结合时序特征提取、非线性交互和动态特征加权，使用5万条销售数据训练。

Result: 模型表现优异，RMSE为1.23，MSE为1.51，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为农业市场价格预测提供了可扩展且有效的方法，对供应链管理和价格策略优化有重要价值。

Abstract: With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price
forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value
crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as
seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle
with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid
deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer
Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for
dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass
avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as
sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected
from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic
preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization,
the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate
that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance,
with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods.
This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series
forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for
intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.

Result: 实验表明，Online-iForest性能与在线方法相当，接近离线方法，且在效率上显著优于所有竞争对手。

Conclusion: Online-iForest是高效实时异常检测的理想选择，适用于网络安全、欺诈和故障检测等场景。

Abstract: The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which
require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions
when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods
also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic
retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel
method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the
data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on
real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online
alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection
techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest
consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a
promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of
primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在复杂几何流形上的分布采样中表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了流形约束数据采样中的奇异性问题，显著提升了生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Euclidean diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative
modeling across diverse domains, and they have been extended to manifold case
in recent advances. Instead of explicitly utilizing the structure of special
manifolds as studied in previous works, we investigate direct sampling of the
Euclidean diffusion models for general manifold-constrained data in this paper.
We reveal the multiscale singularity of the score function in the embedded
space of manifold, which hinders the accuracy of diffusion-generated samples.
We then present an elaborate theoretical analysis of the singularity structure
of the score function by separating it along the tangential and normal
directions of the manifold. To mitigate the singularity and improve the
sampling accuracy, we propose two novel methods: (1) Niso-DM, which introduces
non-isotropic noise along the normal direction to reduce scale discrepancies,
and (2) Tango-DM, which trains only the tangential component of the score
function using a tangential-only loss function. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our methods achieve superior performance on distributions over
various manifolds with complex geometries.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种交互式持续学习范式RiCL，通过实时人类反馈动态学习新技能，同时保留已有知识，解决了传统持续学习的静态数据和干净标签假设问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习依赖静态数据和干净标签，而现实中的反馈往往是动态且含噪声的。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出RiCL框架，包含时间一致性感知净化器、交互感知直接偏好优化策略和抗噪声对比学习模块。

Result: 在FewRel和TACRED数据集上，RiCL显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RiCL通过动态反馈和噪声处理，提升了持续学习的效果。

Abstract: This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI
models dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while
retaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major
limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using
streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with
fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling
the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems,
we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from
dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal
consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in
data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to
align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and
human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that
captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus
avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise
patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing
combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label
learning methods.

Motivation: 传统统计方法和机器学习模型难以捕捉事故中各因素的复杂交互作用，研究旨在利用LLM更全面地分析事故原因。

Method: 通过QLoRA微调Llama3 8B模型，利用226项高速公路事故相关研究构建训练数据集，进行零样本分类识别事故原因。

Result: 模型有效识别了酒驾、超速、攻击性驾驶和分心驾驶等主要原因，并通过问卷调查验证了88.89%的研究者认同其实用性。

Conclusion: LLM能够全面分析事故原因，为交通规划者和政策制定者提供有价值的见解和潜在对策。

Abstract: Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing
strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical
methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex
interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each
crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway
crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226
traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset
encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was
created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its
understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in
these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash
causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing
comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable
and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively
identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,
aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as
road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical
applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated
by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety,
as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the
complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive
analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it
provides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and
policymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety
practices.

Motivation: 长期持续学习（CL）面临任务数量庞大导致的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法在此场景下表现不佳，亟需新解决方案。

Method: 提出Long-CL框架，包括任务核心记忆管理策略和长期记忆巩固机制，选择性地保留关键样本以优化知识保留。

Result: 在两个新基准测试（MMLongCL-Bench和TextLongCL-Bench）上，Long-CL分别比现有最佳方法提高了7.4%和6.5%的平均精度（AP）。

Conclusion: Long-CL通过模仿人类记忆机制，显著提升了长期持续学习的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向和资源。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a long-term continual learning (CL) task, where a
model learns sequentially from a stream of vast tasks over time, acquiring new
knowledge while retaining previously learned information in a manner akin to
human learning. Unlike traditional CL settings, long-term CL involves handling
a significantly larger number of tasks, which exacerbates the issue of
catastrophic forgetting. Our work seeks to address two critical questions: 1)
How do existing CL methods perform in the context of long-term CL? and 2) How
can we mitigate the catastrophic forgetting that arises from prolonged
sequential updates? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework
inspired by human memory mechanisms for long-term continual learning (Long-CL).
Specifically, we introduce a task-core memory management strategy to
efficiently index crucial memories and adaptively update them as learning
progresses. Additionally, we develop a long-term memory consolidation mechanism
that selectively retains hard and discriminative samples, ensuring robust
knowledge retention. To facilitate research in this area, we construct and
release two multi-modal and textual benchmarks, MMLongCL-Bench and
TextLongCL-Bench, providing a valuable resource for evaluating long-term CL
approaches. Experimental results show that Long-CL outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art by 7.4\% and 6.5\% AP on the two benchmarks, respectively,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: TransPL是一种新颖的无监督域适应方法，通过建模源域的联合分布和利用代码转移矩阵，解决了时间序列数据中伪标签生成的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪标签策略在时间序列数据中无法捕捉时间模式和通道间变化，导致伪标签质量不佳。

Method: TransPL通过向量量化时间序列块生成代码转移矩阵，并利用贝叶斯规则进行目标域适应，生成基于通道加权类条件似然的伪标签。

Result: 在四个时间序列UDA基准测试中，TransPL显著优于现有方法（准确率提升6.1%，F1分数提升4.9%）。

Conclusion: TransPL不仅性能优越，还能通过代码转移矩阵提供可解释的域适应过程。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for time series data remains a critical
challenge in deep learning, with traditional pseudo-labeling strategies failing
to capture temporal patterns and channel-wise shifts between domains, producing
sub-optimal pseudo-labels. As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that
addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X},
y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are
derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method
constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source
domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating
pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods.
TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions
and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards
different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable
pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive
analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1%
accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable
insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition
matrices.

Conclusion: FedRAG通过共享非敏感信息实现性能提升和隐私保护，是一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) methods usually share the encrypted

while preserving everyone's privacy. In this work, we propose that sharing the
approximated behavior metric-based state projection function is a promising way
to enhance the performance of FRL and concurrently provides an effective
protection of sensitive information. We introduce FedRAG, a FRL framework to
learn a computationally practical projection function of states for each client
and aggregating the parameters of projection functions at a central server. The
FedRAG approach shares no sensitive task-specific information, yet provides
information gain for each client. We conduct extensive experiments on the
DeepMind Control Suite to demonstrate insightful results.

provides robust contextual comprehension and generalization capabilities, while
a fine-tuning approach is adopted to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To
enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and
learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract
universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and

Method: 提出两种算法：一种将问题转化为分布鲁棒折扣MDP，另一种引入锚定状态以稳定控制转移核。

Result: 在名义MDP均匀遍历的假设下，两种算法在KL和f_k散度不确定性集下实现了样本复杂度为O~(|S||A|t_mix^2ε^-2)。

Conclusion: 这是首次为分布鲁棒平均奖励强化学习提供有限样本收敛保证，并通过数值实验验证了收敛率。

Abstract: Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is
critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the
problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning.
We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The
first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP),
while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state
to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set.
Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms
attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}|
t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as
well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based
uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here,
$\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote
the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing
time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence
guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the
convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.

Result: 现有算法在硬任务上成功率仅35.44%，远低于真实数据的64.37%，需改进。

Conclusion: 需优化算法以更好利用LLM生成数据，未来研究方向包括快速适应和多模态任务扩展。

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on
extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While
recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this
limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for
mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the
lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench,
the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that
leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of
ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and
LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering
locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural
language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate
language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of
state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying
existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks,
achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method
training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for
algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally,
we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization
of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and
extension to multi-modal tasks. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 在基因表达和药物反应数据集上，QHML模型在优化归一化后表现优于经典深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子计算机在生物医学数据分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum-classical Hybrid Machine Learning (QHML) models are recognized for
their robust performance and high generalization ability even for relatively
small datasets. These qualities offer unique advantages for anti-cancer drug
response prediction, where the number of available samples is typically small.
However, such hybrid models appear to be very sensitive to the data encoding
used at the interface of a neural network and a quantum circuit, with
suboptimal choices leading to stability issues. To address this problem, we
propose a novel strategy that uses a normalization function based on a
moderated gradient version of the $\tanh$. This method transforms the outputs
of the neural networks without concentrating them at the extreme value ranges.
Our idea was evaluated on a dataset of gene expression and drug response
measurements for various cancer cell lines, where we compared the prediction
performance of a classical deep learning model and several QHML models. These
results confirmed that QHML performed better than the classical models when
data was optimally normalized. This study opens up new possibilities for
biomedical data analysis using quantum computers.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for
mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also
garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not
guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across
different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of
incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which
are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To
this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and
ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical
gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements
necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a
framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which
can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without
significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of
fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit.
In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability
to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this
framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as
their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave
among the functionalities of language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IPAL的新方法，通过结合原型对比学习和图结构信息，解决了图神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>

Motivation: 图神经网络（GNN）在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法如基于排练的技术和非示例方法存在内存爆炸、隐私问题或特征漂移等限制。

Method: 提出了Instance-Prototype Affinity Learning (IPAL)，结合Topology-Integrated Gaussian Prototypes (TIGP)和Instance-Prototype Affinity Distillation (IPAD)，并嵌入Decision Boundary Perception (DBP)机制。

Result: 在四个节点分类基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，实现了可塑性和稳定性的更好平衡。

Conclusion: IPAL通过结合图结构信息和原型学习，有效缓解了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为图神经网络的持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) endure catastrophic forgetting, undermining their
capacity to preserve previously acquired knowledge amid the assimilation of
novel information. Rehearsal-based techniques revisit historical examples,
adopted as a principal strategy to alleviate this phenomenon. However, memory
explosion and privacy infringements impose significant constraints on their
utility. Non-Exemplar methods circumvent the prior issues through Prototype
Replay (PR), yet feature drift presents new challenges. In this paper, our
empirical findings reveal that Prototype Contrastive Learning (PCL) exhibits
less pronounced drift than conventional PR. Drawing upon PCL, we propose
Instance-Prototype Affinity Learning (IPAL), a novel paradigm for Non-Exemplar
Continual Graph Learning (NECGL). Exploiting graph structural information, we
formulate Topology-Integrated Gaussian Prototypes (TIGP), guiding feature
distributions towards high-impact nodes to augment the model's capacity for
assimilating new knowledge. Instance-Prototype Affinity Distillation (IPAD)
safeguards task memory by regularizing discontinuities in class relationships.
Moreover, we embed a Decision Boundary Perception (DBP) mechanism within PCL,
fostering greater inter-class discriminability. Evaluations on four node
classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a better trade-off between
plasticity and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型通常牺牲透明度和可解释性以追求准确性，这导致难以满足监管要求和获得利益相关者信任。

Method: 采用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost的堆叠集成模型，并结合SHAP、LIME、PDP和PFI等XAI技术提升模型透明性。

Result: 在IEEE-CIS欺诈检测数据集上，模型准确率达99%，AUC-ROC为0.99，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高预测准确性与透明可解释性可以结合，为金融欺诈检测提供更可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models often prioritize predictive accuracy,
often at the expense of model transparency and interpretability. The lack of
transparency makes it difficult for organizations to comply with regulatory
requirements and gain stakeholders trust. In this research, we propose a fraud
detection framework that combines a stacking ensemble of well-known gradient
boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are used to enhance the transparency
and interpretability of the model's decisions. We used SHAP (SHapley Additive
Explanations) for feature selection to identify the most important features.
Further efforts were made to explain the model's predictions using Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME), Partial Dependence Plots
(PDP), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI). The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection
dataset, which includes more than 590,000 real transaction records, was used to
evaluate the proposed model. The model achieved a high performance with an
accuracy of 99% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.99, outperforming several recent
related approaches. These results indicate that combining high prediction
accuracy with transparent interpretability is possible and could lead to a more
ethical and trustworthy solution in financial fraud detection.

Result: 在Cityscapes和NYU-v2等数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应蒸馏和知识轨迹有效提升了联合建模的性能。

Abstract: Depth estimation and scene segmentation are two important tasks in
intelligent transportation systems. A joint modeling of these two tasks will
reduce the requirement for both the storage and training efforts. This work
explores how the multi-task distillation could be used to improve such unified
modeling. While existing solutions transfer multiple teachers' knowledge in a
static way, we propose a self-adaptive distillation method that can dynamically
adjust the knowledge amount from each teacher according to the student's
current learning ability. Furthermore, as multiple teachers exist, the
student's gradient update direction in the distillation is more prone to be
erroneous where knowledge forgetting may occur. To avoid this, we propose a
knowledge trajectory to record the most essential information that a model has
learnt in the past, based on which a trajectory-based distillation loss is
designed to guide the student to follow the learning curve similarly in a
cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarking datasets
including Cityscapes and NYU-v2. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions,
our method achieves a clearly improvement. The code is provided in the
supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测方法仅依赖单模态时间序列数据，无法充分利用文本信息，整合LLM和TSFM的优势成为关键挑战。

Method: 采用解耦框架，LLM将文本事件转化为修订指令，指导TSFM输出；提出两阶段训练策略和高质量多模态基准。

Result: ChronoSteer在合成数据上训练后，预测准确性比单模态基线提升25.7%，优于现有最佳多模态方法22.5%。

Conclusion: ChronoSteer有效整合文本和时间序列信息，显著提升预测性能，解决了跨模态数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting
their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated
powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively.
Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that
concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future
inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity
of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is
employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then
used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce
ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision
instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the
shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage
training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a
high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the
information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM,
ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7%
improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a
22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法难以适应实时变化，启发式方法策略僵化，现有学习方法缺乏通用性和可解释性。

Method: 将ODMBP建模为半马尔可夫决策过程（SMDP-Option），采用两阶段架构（Option Miner和Option Composer），利用LLM生成策略。

Result: 在超过10,000个虚拟机的场景中，MiCo达到96.9%的竞争比，且在非稳态请求流和多样化配置下表现优异。

Conclusion: MiCo在复杂和大规模云环境中表现出高效性和适应性。

Abstract: In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online
Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by
large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization
methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed
heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based
methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named
MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design
paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov
Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling
through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer.
Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware
strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer
employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the
non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on
real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\%
competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual
machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows
and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and
large-scale cloud environments.

Abstract: Injecting rule-based models like Random Forests into differentiable neural
network frameworks remains an open challenge in machine learning. Recent
advancements have demonstrated that pretrained models can generate efficient
molecular embeddings. However, these approaches often require extensive
pretraining and additional techniques, such as incorporating posterior
probabilities, to boost performance. In our study, we propose a novel strategy
that jointly trains a single Graph Transformer neural network on both sparse
multitask molecular property experimental targets and synthetic targets derived
from XGBoost models trained on Osmordred molecular descriptors. These synthetic
tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and
significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction
tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms
the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task
augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in
multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection
or pretraining.

Conclusion: 通过优化本地模型的适应性，可以有效提升联邦学习中全局模型的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables the clients to collaboratively train a global
model, which is aggregated from local models. Due to the heterogeneous data
distributions over clients and data privacy in federated learning, it is
difficult to train local models to achieve a well-performed global model. In
this paper, we introduce the adaptability of local models, i.e., the average
performance of local models on data distributions over clients, and enhance the
performance of the global model by improving the adaptability of local models.
Since each client does not know the data distributions over other clients, the
adaptability of the local model cannot be directly optimized. First, we provide
the property of an appropriate local model which has good adaptability on the
data distributions over clients. Then, we formalize the property into the local
training objective with a constraint and propose a feasible solution to train
the local model. Extensive experiments on federated learning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adaptability of local
models and achieves a well-performed global model that consistently outperforms
the baseline methods.

Conclusion: FedAPC能有效提升模型泛化能力，减少对特定域的过拟合。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training while ensuring data
privacy across distributed edge devices, making it a popular solution for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL faces significant challenges due to
statistical heterogeneity, particularly domain heterogeneity, which impedes the
global mode's convergence. In this study, we introduce a new framework to
address this challenge by improving the generalization ability of the FL global
model under domain heterogeneity, using prototype augmentation. Specifically,
we introduce FedAPC (Federated Augmented Prototype Contrastive Learning), a
prototype-based FL framework designed to enhance feature diversity and model
robustness. FedAPC leverages prototypes derived from the mean features of
augmented data to capture richer representations. By aligning local features
with global prototypes, we enable the model to learn meaningful semantic
features while reducing overfitting to any specific domain. Experimental
results on the Office-10 and Digits datasets illustrate that our framework
outperforms SOTA baselines, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: QuXAI框架显著提升了HQML模型的解释性和可靠性，为量子增强AI技术的安全与负责任应用提供了支持。

Abstract: The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models
opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental
complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency
and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in
its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local
explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ
quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus
of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an
explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model
entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use
of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum
transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result
shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as
well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI
techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more
significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY.
The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route
to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting
greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use
of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，Alinear使用不到1%的参数优于大型模型，并在不同预测范围内保持高精度。

Conclusion: 挑战了‘模型越大越好’的普遍观念，提出了更高效的时间序列建模范式。

Abstract: Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series
forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent
architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have
often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is
this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law
in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight
forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level
parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that
dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths,
alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable
prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational
overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models
while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy
across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly
evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric
that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our
analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components
varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern,
validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the
prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a
paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.

Result: YOLOv8表现最佳，平均精度达96%，能检测比间距更小的缺陷，并在真实SEM数据中表现良好。

Conclusion: 合成数据可替代真实数据，用于开发鲁棒的机器学习模型。

Abstract: In the photolithographic process vital to semiconductor manufacturing,
various types of defects appear during EUV pattering. Due to ever-shrinking
pattern size, these defects are extremely small and cause false or missed
detection during inspection. Specifically, the lack of defect-annotated quality
data with good representation of smaller defects has prohibited deployment of
deep learning based defect detection models in fabrication lines. To resolve
the problem of data unavailability, we artificially generate scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of line patterns with known distribution of defects and
autonomously annotate them. We then employ state-of-the-art object detection
models to investigate defect detection performance as a function of defect
size, much smaller than the pitch width. We find that the real-time object
detector YOLOv8 has the best mean average precision of 96% as compared to
EfficientNet, 83%, and SSD, 77%, with the ability to detect smaller defects. We
report the smallest defect size that can be detected reliably. When tested on
real SEM data, the YOLOv8 model correctly detected 84.6% of Bridge defects and
78.3% of Break defects across all relevant instances. These promising results
suggest that synthetic data can be used as an alternative to real-world data in
order to develop robust machine-learning models.

Abstract: Monitoring feeding behaviour is a relevant task for efficient herd management
and the effective use of available resources in grazing cattle. The ability to
automatically recognise animals' feeding activities through the identification
of specific jaw movements allows for the improvement of diet formulation, as
well as early detection of metabolic problems and symptoms of animal
discomfort, among other benefits. The use of sensors to obtain signals for such
monitoring has become popular in the last two decades. The most frequently
employed sensors include accelerometers, microphones, and cameras, each with
its own set of advantages and drawbacks. An unexplored aspect is the
simultaneous use of multiple sensors with the aim of combining signals in order
to enhance the precision of the estimations. In this direction, this work
introduces a deep neural network based on the fusion of acoustic and inertial
signals, composed of convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers. The main
advantage of this model is the combination of signals through the automatic
extraction of features independently from each of them. The model has emerged
from an exploration and comparison of different neural network architectures
proposed in this work, which carry out information fusion at different levels.
Feature-level fusion has outperformed data and decision-level fusion by at
least a 0.14 based on the F1-score metric. Moreover, a comparison with
state-of-the-art machine learning methods is presented, including traditional
and deep learning approaches. The proposed model yielded an F1-score value of
0.802, representing a 14% increase compared to previous methods. Finally,
results from an ablation study and post-training quantization evaluation are
also reported.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a
growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities
beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain
knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in
time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as
energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses
LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting
accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series
dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary
information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly
outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and
generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer
strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting
tasks.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在整合位置信息和多头注意力灵活性方面存在局限性，ComplexFormer旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用复数多头注意力（CMHA），包括每头的欧拉变换和自适应差分旋转机制，统一建模语义和位置差异。

Result: 在语言建模、文本生成等任务中表现优异，生成困惑度更低，长上下文一致性更好。

Conclusion: ComplexFormer提供了一种更灵活、高效的注意力机制，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on self-attention to capture token dependencies but
face challenges in effectively integrating positional information while
allowing multi-head attention (MHA) flexibility. Prior methods often model
semantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional
adjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity. This
paper introduces ComplexFormer, featuring Complex Multi-Head Attention-CMHA.
CMHA empowers each head to independently model semantic and positional
differences unified within the complex plane, representing interactions as
rotations and scaling. ComplexFormer incorporates two key improvements: (1) a
per-head Euler transformation, converting real-valued query/key projections
into polar-form complex vectors for head-specific complex subspace operation;
and (2) a per-head adaptive differential rotation mechanism,
exp[i(Adapt(ASmn,i) + Delta(Pmn),i)], allowing each head to learn distinct
strategies for integrating semantic angle differences (ASmn,i) with relative
positional encodings (Delta(Pmn),i). Extensive experiments on language
modeling, text generation, code generation, and mathematical reasoning show
ComplexFormer achieves superior performance, significantly lower generation
perplexity , and improved long-context coherence compared to strong baselines
like RoPE-Transformers. ComplexFormer demonstrates strong parameter efficiency,

Conclusion: SpecOffload通过优化资源利用和推测解码，显著提升了LLM在资源受限设备上的推理效率。

Abstract: Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant
challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory,
existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O
overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1)
GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be
loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its
capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose
SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative
decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for
storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus
accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we
carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in
speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to
manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best
baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts
inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于深度强化学习（DRL）的电动公交车（EB）充电调度问题，提出了一种分层DRL（HDRL）方法，通过分解原始MDP为高层SMDP和低层MDP，并设计了HDDQN-HER算法，以最小化充电成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动公交车充电调度问题复杂，涉及长时间跨度和稀疏奖励，传统方法难以有效解决，因此需要一种分层强化学习方法。

Method: 提出分层DRL（HDRL）方法，将原始MDP分解为高层SMDP和低层MDP，并设计HDDQN-HER算法，分阶段学习高层和低层策略。

Conclusion: 提出的HDRL方法有效解决了电动公交车充电调度问题，分层设计和HER算法显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: 本文提出的攻击方法显著提升了数据重构的效率和规模，揭示了联邦学习中的潜在隐私风险。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning
models across distributed clients without sharing raw data, ostensibly
preserving data privacy. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical
vulnerabilities in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate
model updates to reconstruct clients' private training data. Existing data
reconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on
assumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency
significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.
  In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes
these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully
connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect
recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any
prior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image
and tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing
methods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of
magnitude larger than the state of the art.

Result: 证明了该学习规则能最终识别出活动最高的前突触神经元。

Conclusion: 揭示了Hebbian学习规则与噪声镜像下降的内在联系，为理解生物神经网络的学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a key principle underlying learning in biological neural
networks. It postulates that synaptic changes occur locally, depending on the
activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian learning based on
neuronal firing rates is well explored, much less is known about learning rules
that account for precise spike-timing. We relate a Hebbian
spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect
to a natural loss function on the probability simplex. This connection allows
us to prove that the learning rule eventually identifies the presynaptic neuron
with the highest activity. We also discover an intrinsic connection to noisy
mirror descent.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step
toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems,
charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on
real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical
challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and
fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities,
charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales
and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the
original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these
MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL
algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic
(DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at
both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor
network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state
information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low
level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is
incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated
charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing
convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the
superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet
charging schedules.

Motivation: 联邦学习中设备异构性导致数据分布不均，增加了后门攻击检测的难度。

Method: 提出FeRA机制，利用特征表示重构误差计算异常分数，识别偏离群体共识的客户端。

Result: 实验表明FeRA在非独立同分布数据下表现稳健，显著降低后门攻击成功率且不影响主任务准确性。

Conclusion: FeRA是一种模型无关、攻击无关且无需标记数据的防御方法，适用于异构边缘设备。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy and reduces communication cost for
resource-constrained edge clients by supporting distributed model training at
the edge. However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse,
non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the
detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a
novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA,
that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to
distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based
on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose
internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our
evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios,
including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices.
Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success
rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is
model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data,
making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.

Conclusion: NML-GCL有效解决了假阴性问题，提升了图对比学习的性能。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) often suffers from false negatives, which
degrades the performance on downstream tasks. The existing methods addressing
the false negative issue usually rely on human prior knowledge, still leading
GCL to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Negative Metric
Learning (NML) enhanced GCL (NML-GCL). NML-GCL employs a learnable Negative
Metric Network (NMN) to build a negative metric space, in which false negatives
can be distinguished better from true negatives based on their distance to
anchor node. To overcome the lack of explicit supervision signals for NML, we
propose a joint training scheme with bi-level optimization objective, which
implicitly utilizes the self-supervision signals to iteratively optimize the
encoder and the negative metric network. The solid theoretical analysis and the
extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: ADSGD因其简单性、内存和通信效率以及对延迟的鲁棒性，适用于现实世界的去中心化学习任务。

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become vital for leveraging distributed data
without central control, enhancing scalability and privacy. However, practical
deployments face fundamental challenges due to heterogeneous computation speeds
and unpredictable communication delays. This paper introduces a refined model
of Asynchronous Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADSGD) under
practical assumptions of bounded computation and communication times. To
understand the convergence of ADSGD, we first analyze Asynchronous Stochastic
Block Coordinate Descent (ASBCD) as a tool, and then show that ADSGD converges
under computation-delay-independent step sizes. The convergence result is
established without assuming bounded data heterogeneity. Empirical experiments
reveal that ADSGD outperforms existing methods in wall-clock convergence time
across various scenarios. With its simplicity, efficiency in memory and
communication, and resilience to communication and computation delays, ADSGD is
well-suited for real-world decentralized learning tasks.

Result: 研究表明，这两种能力能够帮助RL代理在部署时高效适应新环境变化。

Conclusion: 高效在线适应需要优先探索和选择性知识保留的结合。

Abstract: Real-world autonomous decision-making systems, from robots to recommendation
engines, must operate in environments that change over time. While deep
reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal
policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume
a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result,
conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a
fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when
encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without
catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation
demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities:
(1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and
learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior
knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without
disruption to reusable components.

Abstract: Randomness is ubiquitous in many applications across data science and machine
learning. Remarkably, systems composed of random components often display
emergent global behaviors that appear deterministic, manifesting a transition
from microscopic disorder to macroscopic organization. In this work, we
introduce a theoretical model for studying the emergence of collective
behaviors in ensembles of random classifiers. We argue that, if the ensemble is
weighted through the Gibbs measure defined by adopting the classification loss
as an energy, then there exists a finite temperature parameter for the
distribution such that the classification is optimal, with respect to the loss
(or the energy). Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by
a Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher
perceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal
temperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by
construction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random
classifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior.
Experiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in
high-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to
shed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well-established as a principled approach
to probabilistic unsupervised learning with neural networks. Typically, an
encoder network defines the parameters of a Gaussian distributed latent space
from which we can sample and pass realizations to a decoder network. This model
is trained to reconstruct its inputs and is optimized through the evidence
lower bound. In recent years, discrete latent spaces have grown in popularity,
suggesting that they may be a natural choice for many data modalities (e.g.
text). In this tutorial, we provide a rigorous, yet practical, introduction to
discrete variational autoencoders -- specifically, VAEs in which the latent
space is made up of latent variables that follow a categorical distribution. We
assume only a basic mathematical background with which we carefully derive each
step from first principles. From there, we develop a concrete training recipe
and provide an example implementation, hosted at

Conclusion: SMTOs仍有优势，但固定权重在某些场景下表现相似，代码将公开。

Abstract: Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) balance task learning in Multi-Task
Learning by addressing issues like conflicting gradients and differing gradient
norms, which hinder equal-weighted task training. However, recent critiques
suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to
SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor
hyperparameter optimization and lack of regularization. In this work, we
evaluate these claims through an extensive empirical evaluation of SMTOs,
including some of the latest methods, on more complex multi-task problems to
clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared
to uniform loss and that fixed weights can achieve competitive performance
compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform
similarly to SMTOs in some instances. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: There are now a multitude of AI-scribing solutions for healthcare promising
the utilization of large language models for ambient documentation. However,
these AI scribes still rely on one-shot, or few-shot prompts for generating
notes after the consultation has ended, employing little to no reasoning. This
risks long notes with an increase in hallucinations, misrepresentation of the
intent of the clinician, and reliance on the proofreading of the clinician to
catch errors. A dangerous combination for patient safety if vigilance is
compromised by workload and fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a method for
extracting salient clinical information in real-time alongside the healthcare
consultation, denoted Facts, and use that information recursively to generate
the final note. The FactsR method results in more accurate and concise notes by
placing the clinician-in-the-loop of note generation, while opening up new use
cases within real-time decision support.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for learning over
graph-structured data, yet their expressive capacity is often hindered by
over-squashing, wherein information from distant nodes is compressed into
fixed-size vectors. Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and
bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid
this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley
graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical
properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory
usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation
(SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features
through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology.
SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space,
improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational
efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification
benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or
exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits
particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures,
offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory
footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained
applications.

Method: 提出PIF方法，通过高维空间嵌入数据并使用PI-Forest树计算异常分数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有技术，PI-Forest能更好地测量任意距离和隔离点。

Conclusion: PIF是一种有效的异常检测方法，尤其在偏好空间中表现优异。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting anomalies with respect to structured
patterns. To this end, we conceive a novel anomaly detection method called PIF,
that combines the advantages of adaptive isolation methods with the flexibility
of preference embedding. Specifically, we propose to embed the data in a high
dimensional space where an efficient tree-based method, PI-Forest, is employed
to compute an anomaly score. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that PIF favorably compares with state-of-the-art anomaly detection
techniques, and confirm that PI-Forest is better at measuring arbitrary
distances and isolate points in the preference space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AneuG是一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的两阶段颅内动脉瘤（IA）网格生成器，能够生成具有特定形态学特征的IA形状，并考虑了动脉瘤囊与母血管的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模的IA图像数据集，现有的形状生成方法难以捕捉真实的IA特征且无法控制生成特定形态学测量值，因此需要一种更有效的生成模型。

Method: AneuG采用两阶段方法：第一阶段生成低维图谐波变形（GHD）令牌编码和重建动脉瘤囊形状；第二阶段基于GHD令牌生成母血管，并通过血管中心线和横截面传播实现。

Result: AneuG能够生成具有生理真实感的IA形状，并可进一步控制生成具有特定临床相关形态学测量值的形状。

Conclusion: AneuG为研究IA形状变化及其对血流动力学的影响提供了有效工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: A generative model for the mesh geometry of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is
crucial for training networks to predict blood flow forces in real time, which
is a key factor affecting disease progression. This need is necessitated by the
absence of a large IA image datasets. Existing shape generation methods
struggle to capture realistic IA features and ignore the relationship between
IA pouches and parent vessels, limiting physiological realism and their
generation cannot be controlled to have specific morphological measurements. We
propose AneuG, a two-stage Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based IA mesh
generator. In the first stage, AneuG generates low-dimensional Graph Harmonic
Deformation (GHD) tokens to encode and reconstruct aneurysm pouch shapes,
constrained to morphing energy statistics truths. GHD enables more accurate
shape encoding than alternatives. In the second stage, AneuG generates parent
vessels conditioned on GHD tokens, by generating vascular centreline and
propagating the cross-section. AneuG's IA shape generation can further be
conditioned to have specific clinically relevant morphological measurements.
This is useful for studies to understand shape variations represented by
clinical measurements, and for flow simulation studies to understand effects of
specific clinical shape parameters on fluid dynamics. Source code and
implementation details are available at

Motivation: 解决增量学习中平衡新任务学习与旧知识保留的挑战，同时避免资源浪费。

Method: 通过动态扩展模型结构（仅在必要时）和交叉蒸馏训练保持稳定性，NAS联合搜索架构和扩展策略。

Result: SEAL在多个基准测试中减少了遗忘，提高了准确性，同时保持了较小的模型规模。

Conclusion: 结合NAS和选择性扩展在增量学习中具有高效和适应性强的潜力。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from
a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing
plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge).
Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of
the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static
settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often
rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in
resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based
framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint
data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL
adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary,
based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through
cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component
jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy.
Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively
reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size
compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS
and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental
scenarios.

Result: 多机制分解显著提升数据效率，接近人类学习水平，且效果优于符号与子符号学习的区分。

Conclusion: 整合多种学习机制可能是缩小机器学习与人类学习效率差距的关键。

Abstract: Human learning relies on specialization -- distinct cognitive mechanisms
working together to enable rapid learning. In contrast, most modern neural
networks rely on a single mechanism: gradient descent over an objective
function. This raises the question: might human learners' relatively rapid
learning from just tens of examples instead of tens of thousands in data-driven
deep learning arise from our ability to use multiple specialized mechanisms of
learning in combination? We investigate this question through an ablation
analysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring
environments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient
3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning
into multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency,
bringing it in line with human learning. Furthermore, we show that this
decomposition has a greater impact on efficiency than the distinction between
symbolic and subsymbolic learning alone. Efforts to align data-driven machine
learning with human learning often overlook the stark difference in learning
efficiency. Our findings suggest that integrating multiple specialized learning
mechanisms may be key to bridging this gap.

Result: 发现无分布学习在神经网络中存在根本限制，adc与统计查询维度有多项式关系。

Conclusion: 数据分布假设在实践中至关重要，adc框架为理论分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: We study the relationship between gradient-based optimization of parametric
models (e.g., neural networks) and optimization of linear combinations of
random features. Our main result shows that if a parametric model can be
learned using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (bSGD) without making
assumptions about the data distribution, then with high probability, the target
function can also be approximated using a polynomial-sized combination of
random features. The size of this combination depends on the number of gradient
steps and numerical precision used in the bSGD process. This finding reveals
fundamental limitations of distribution-free learning in neural networks
trained by gradient descent, highlighting why making assumptions about data
distributions is often crucial in practice. Along the way, we also introduce a
new theoretical framework called average probabilistic dimension complexity
(adc), which extends the probabilistic dimension complexity developed by Kamath
et al. (2020). We prove that adc has a polynomial relationship with statistical
query dimension, and use this relationship to demonstrate an infinite
separation between adc and standard dimension complexity.

Conclusion: L2T通过强化学习优化模型，实现了推理效果与计算效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in
reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between
reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging
unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we
propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement
fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning
with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as
a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense
process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in
parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We
propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and
the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly
reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately
rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T
optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each
episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning
benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different
tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Clouds and precipitation are important for understanding weather and climate.
Simulating clouds and precipitation with traditional numerical weather
prediction is challenging because of the sub-grid parameterizations required.
Machine learning has been explored for forecasting clouds and precipitation,
but early machine learning methods often created blurry forecasts. In this
paper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero
to three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and
intuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for
the community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting
geostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of
diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual
correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our
results show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing
clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation.
These results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the
past 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows
the preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a
conventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion
models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion
models, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin
on root mean squared error. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box
ensemble generation, which shows skillful calibration, with the spread of the
ensemble correlating well to the error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小型语言模型无法处理视觉输入且预测不匹配视觉上下文，限制了推测解码在视觉语言模型中的应用。

Method: MASSV分两阶段：1) 通过轻量级投影器连接目标模型的视觉编码器；2) 使用目标模型生成的响应进行自蒸馏视觉指令调优。

Result: 实验表明，MASSV在视觉任务中接受长度提升30%，推理速度提升1.46倍。

Conclusion: MASSV为加速当前及未来视觉语言模型提供了一种可扩展且兼容架构的方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by
enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger
target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to
vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small
language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural
components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match
those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce
Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of
Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models
into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first
connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight
trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning
using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.
Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families
demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers
end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV
provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both
current and future VLMs.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems.
Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires
performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has
to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of
conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally
linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing
identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine
operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using
the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous
part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman
eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using
metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based
eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against
an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear
feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the
eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled
proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control
approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the
optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results
showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark
controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under
sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Conclusion: 表示叠加是神经缩放定律的关键机制，未来可能通过优化训练策略和架构提升性能。

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the
observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this
neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model
size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs
represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,
representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur
with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss
scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only
the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of
loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature
frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong
superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,
the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide
range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is
explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower
dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales
inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced
LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match
the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also
agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an
important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate
that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model
architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer
parameters.

Motivation: 传统扩展语言模型的方法（参数扩展或推理时扩展）通常需要较高的空间或时间成本，而并行扩展提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过应用P种多样且可学习的输入变换，并行执行模型前向传播，并动态聚合P个输出，实现并行扩展。

Result: 实验表明，并行扩展在相同性能提升下，内存和延迟增加显著低于参数扩展，并可利用少量令牌对预训练模型进行后训练。

Conclusion: 并行扩展为低资源场景下部署更强大模型提供了新思路，并重新定义了计算在机器学习中的作用。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a
significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter
scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and
more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel
computation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and
learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in
parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely
parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing
parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,
data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it
through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel
streams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\log P)$ while showing
superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\times$
less memory increase and 6$\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter
scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an
off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training
on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new
scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more
powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative
perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.

Result: NCDPO在样本效率和最终性能上优于现有方法，适用于机器人控制和多智能体游戏场景。

Conclusion: NCDPO为扩散策略的强化学习微调提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as
robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills
from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the
sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion
policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures.
While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising
solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to
effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This
challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood
estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated
optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized
policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much
lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies
(MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework
that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy.
By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned
on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and
gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments
demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when
training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency
and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot
control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results
show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the
Diffusion Policy.

Motivation: 现有价值函数分解方法（如VDN、QMIX）在表示能力上有限，无法覆盖完整的IGM值类，而唯一无此限制的QPLEX方法又过于复杂。因此，需要一种既能覆盖完整IGM值类又简单高效的方法。

Method: 提出QFIX方法，通过简单的‘修复’层扩展现有模型的表示能力，并推导了多种QFIX变体，在两种多智能体框架中实现。

Conclusion: QFIX是一种简单且高效的价值函数分解方法，能够覆盖完整的IGM值类，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent
utilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action
selection process between individual utilities and joint values remains
consistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the
individual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is
straightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited
representation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM
values, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is
unnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the
full class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a
novel family of value function decomposition models that expand the
representation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin "fixing" layer.
We derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two
well-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on
multiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i)
succeeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably
and performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this
while employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.

Abstract: This paper addresses fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for function
calling tasks when real user interaction data is unavailable. In digital
content creation tools, where users express their needs through natural
language queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world
task-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate
synthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation
fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data
distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We
present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like
content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and
vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training
data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data
generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a
fundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive
set of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function
classification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our
synthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new
benchmarks for function calling tasks.

Abstract: Recently, post hoc explanation methods have emerged to enhance model
transparency by attributing model outputs to input features. However, these
methods face challenges due to their specificity to certain neural network
architectures and data modalities. Existing explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) frameworks have attempted to address these challenges but suffer from
several limitations. These include limited flexibility to diverse model
architectures and data modalities due to hard-coded implementations, a
restricted number of supported XAI methods because of the requirements for
layer-specific operations of attribution methods, and sub-optimal
recommendations of explanations due to the lack of evaluation and optimization
phases. Consequently, these limitations impede the adoption of XAI technology
in real-world applications, making it difficult for practitioners to select the
optimal explanation method for their domain. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{PnPXAI}, a universal XAI framework that supports diverse data
modalities and neural network models in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) manner. PnPXAI
automatically detects model architectures, recommends applicable explanation
methods, and optimizes hyperparameters for optimal explanations. We validate
the framework's effectiveness through user surveys and showcase its versatility

Motivation: 药物发现中，针对缺乏结构或功能数据的新靶点开发生物活性分子耗时且成本高，药效团建模提供了一种替代方法。

Method: PharmaDiff采用基于Transformer的架构，将3D药效团的原子表示整合到生成过程中，精确生成符合预设药效团假设的3D分子图。

Result: PharmaDiff在匹配3D药效团约束方面优于基于配体的药物设计方法，并在结构基药物设计中获得更高的对接分数。

Conclusion: PharmaDiff通过结合药效团建模与3D生成技术，为理性药物设计提供了强大且灵活的框架。

Abstract: Developing bioactive molecules remains a central, time- and cost-heavy
challenge in drug discovery, particularly for novel targets lacking structural
or functional data. Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for
capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a
biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a
pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation.
PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based
representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling
the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined
pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff
demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints
compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher
docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design,
without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore
modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and
flexible framework for rational drug design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染和极端天气事件加剧了健康风险，利用个人传感和AI技术改善健康监测。

Method: 整合可穿戴设备的生理数据和实时环境暴露数据，使用对抗自编码器神经网络进行预测。

Result: AI模型能准确重构健康信号并捕捉非线性污染响应，迁移学习提高了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化健康监测提供了有效工具，展示了AI在健康领域的潜力。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, causing or
exacerbating many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, climate
change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and
heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of
pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the
collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for
new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside
new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor
and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel
workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by
integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time
environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure
and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual
health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework.
We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network
in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and
captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using
data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities
of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world,
user-generated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对大语言模型（LLM）的训练动态缺乏深入理解，尤其是超越神经缩放定律的规律。

Method: 通过假设损失景观为河谷形态，推导出热力学量（如温度、熵、热容、热传导）和经典热力学原理（如热力学三定律和能量均分定理）在LLM训练中的自然涌现。

Result: 理论证明了热力学概念在LLM训练中的适用性，并提出了直观的学习率调度设计指南。

Conclusion: 神经热力学定律（NTL）为理解LLM训练动态提供了新的科学视角，并为实践中的学习率设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Beyond neural scaling laws, little is known about the laws underlying large
language models (LLMs). We introduce Neural Thermodynamic Laws (NTL) -- a new
framework that offers fresh insights into LLM training dynamics. On the
theoretical side, we demonstrate that key thermodynamic quantities (e.g.,
temperature, entropy, heat capacity, thermal conduction) and classical
thermodynamic principles (e.g., the three laws of thermodynamics and the
equipartition theorem) naturally emerge under river-valley loss landscape
assumptions. On the practical side, this scientific perspective yields
intuitive guidelines for designing learning rate schedules.

*Mattia Marzi,Francesca Giuffrida,Diego Garlaschelli,Tiziano Squartini*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的非线性指数随机图模型（ERGs），通过引入适应性诱导变体，解决了传统线性ERGs无法解释经验度分布方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性ERGs无法解释复杂网络经验度分布的方差，因此需要开发非线性ERGs来解决这一问题。

Method: 论文通过定义一种适应性诱导的两星模型的变体，避免了传统均值场近似导致的模型退化问题。

Result: 改进后的模型能够重现样本方差，同时保留了其线性对应模型的解释能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂网络的结构分析提供了一种更有效的非线性ERGs框架。

Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks
represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random
Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only
linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural
organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of
accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim,
non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field
approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to
degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model
is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory
power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.

Motivation: 探讨网络博弈中协调与反协调行为的动态，特别是在存在显著凝聚力子集的情况下，分析均衡的存在性和稳定性。

Method: 基于有向符号图模型，结合个体偏好和符号权重，分析博弈的纳什均衡及其稳定性。

Result: 证明了在凝聚力子集存在的情况下，博弈存在共识或极化的纳什均衡，且这些均衡在最佳响应动态下稳定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为协调博弈的鲁棒性提供了理论支持，并扩展了图凝聚性概念的应用。

Abstract: We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both
coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an
underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight
that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each
agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the
signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario
that assumes the presence of a prominent 'cohesive' subset of players, who are
either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally
balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities
with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the
properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results
guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or,
respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability
under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness
results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a
novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.

Method: 部署模块化计算集群于风电场，开发Heron软件路由器，根据风电场发电波动动态分配AI推理负载。

Result: Heron能将AI计算的总吞吐量提升高达80%，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合风能与AI计算，通过Heron优化负载分配，是一种经济可行且环保的解决方案。

Abstract: AI power demand is growing unprecedentedly thanks to the high power density
of AI compute and the emerging inferencing workload. On the supply side,
abundant wind power is waiting for grid access in interconnection queues. In
this light, this paper argues bringing AI workload to modular compute clusters
co-located in wind farms. Our deployment right-sizing strategy makes it
economically viable to deploy more than 6 million high-end GPUs today that
could consume cheap, green power at its source. We built Heron, a cross-site
software router, that could efficiently leverage the complementarity of power
generation across wind farms by routing AI inferencing workload around power
drops. Using 1-week ofcoding and conversation production traces from Azure and
(real) variable wind power traces, we show how Heron improves aggregate goodput
of AI compute by up to 80% compared to the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: KAITIAN是一个分布式通信框架，解决异构加速器间的互操作性问题，提升资源利用率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构加速器间的专有通信库导致互操作性差，资源利用不足，性能受限。

Method: KAITIAN提供统一抽象层，结合专有库和通用协议，并采用负载自适应调度机制。

Result: 实验显示KAITIAN加速训练42%，通信开销低（2.8-4.3%），保持模型精度。

Conclusion: KAITIAN为复杂AI应用提供灵活高效的异构计算解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and
intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous
accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing
and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific
proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability
barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types
and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in
distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed
communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified
abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication
libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication
protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a
load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational
tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance
characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously
evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN
demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability
for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can
accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems,
while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining
model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful
heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.

TL;DR: 本文分析了非单调推理（如溯因推理）的复杂性，重点关注知识库中变量数量n作为参数，首次展示了在Σ²P完全问题上超越穷举搜索的成果，并提供了下界和限制条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补单调推理与非单调推理之间的复杂性研究空白，特别是针对溯因推理问题。

Method: 以知识库中变量数量n为参数，分析不同复杂性类别（Σ²P、NP、coNP）的溯因推理问题，并验证其下界。

Result: 首次在Σ²P完全问题上实现了超越穷举搜索的成果，同时提供了基于强指数时间假说的下界限制。

Conclusion: 通过参数化分析，本文为非单调推理的复杂性研究提供了新视角和工具，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a well-known example of monotonic
reasoning, of intense practical interest due to fast solvers, complemented by
rigorous fine-grained complexity results. However, for non-monotonic reasoning,
e.g., abductive reasoning, comparably little is known outside classic
complexity theory. In this paper we take a first step of bridging the gap
between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning by analyzing the complexity of
intractable abduction problems under the seemingly overlooked but natural
parameter n: the number of variables in the knowledge base. We obtain several
positive results for $\Sigma^P_2$- as well as NP- and coNP-complete fragments,
which implies the first example of beating exhaustive search for a
$\Sigma^P_2$-complete problem (to the best of our knowledge). We complement
this with lower bounds and for many fragments rule out improvements under the
(strong) exponential-time hypothesis.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于大语言模型（LLM）和传统方法在儿科败血症数据集上的聚类效果，发现LLM方法在捕捉上下文和关键特征方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法难以处理高维、异构的医疗数据，且缺乏上下文理解能力，因此研究探索了LLM在聚类中的潜力。

Method: 使用LLAMA 3.1 8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B和Stella-En-400M-V5生成嵌入，并应用K-means聚类；传统方法包括K-Medoids聚类和降维技术。

Result: Stella-En-400M-V5获得最高轮廓分数（0.86），LLM方法在识别具有不同特征的子组方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLM在资源有限的环境中具有潜力，可用于上下文表型分析和决策支持。

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient
resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional,
heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing
richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential
of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in
resource-limited settings.

Motivation: CPM在复杂生物系统中计算成本高，需开发替代模型以加速评估。

Method: 使用DDPM训练生成式AI替代模型，结合图像分类器辅助选择和验证。

Result: 替代模型生成20,000时间步的配置，计算时间减少约22倍。

Conclusion: DDPM为开发随机生物系统的数字孪生提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to
investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell
resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework
for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally
expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation
of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated
evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic
nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different
model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work,
we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI
surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We
describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that
define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this
classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model
surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference
configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational
time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards
the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological
systems.

TL;DR: CartoAgent是一个基于多模态大语言模型的多智能体制图框架，通过模拟制图流程的三个关键阶段，生成既美观又信息丰富的地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人工智能的发展为制图过程提供了新机会，但以往研究要么忽视地图的艺术性，要么难以同时保证地图的准确性和信息丰富性。

Method: CartoAgent框架利用多模态大语言模型，分三个阶段（准备、地图设计和评估）协作完成制图任务，将样式与地理数据分离以确保准确性。

Result: 实验和人工评估验证了CartoAgent在地图风格迁移和评估任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: CartoAgent可扩展支持多种制图设计决策，并为生成式AI在制图中的未来集成提供参考。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents
new opportunities to advance the cartographic process. Previous studies have
either overlooked the artistic aspects of maps or faced challenges in creating
both accurate and informative maps. In this study, we propose CartoAgent, a
novel multi-agent cartographic framework powered by multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). This framework simulates three key stages in cartographic
practice: preparation, map design, and evaluation. At each stage, different
MLLMs act as agents with distinct roles to collaborate, discuss, and utilize
tools for specific purposes. In particular, CartoAgent leverages MLLMs' visual
aesthetic capability and world knowledge to generate maps that are both
visually appealing and informative. By separating style from geographic data,
it can focus on designing stylesheets without modifying the vector-based data,
thereby ensuring geographic accuracy. We applied CartoAgent to a specific task
centered on map restyling-namely, map style transfer and evaluation. The
effectiveness of this framework was validated through extensive experiments and
a human evaluation study. CartoAgent can be extended to support a variety of
cartographic design decisions and inform future integrations of GenAI in
cartography.

Result: 研究发现将指导未来DeAgents系统和协议设计，并推动AI治理讨论。

Conclusion: DeAgents在去中心化和自主权方面具有潜力，但需解决LLM可靠性问题。

Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents)
combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization
technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution
environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents
to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and
control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates
centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust
concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges
in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension
between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this
empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts,
founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance
dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design
and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the
future agentic web.

Abstract: Voting advice applications (VAAs), which have become increasingly prominent
in European elections, are seen as a successful tool for boosting electorates'
political knowledge and engagement. However, VAAs' complex language and rigid
presentation constrain their utility to less-sophisticated voters. While
previous work enhanced VAAs' click-based interaction with scripted
explanations, a conversational chatbot's potential for tailored discussion and
deliberate political decision-making remains untapped. Our exploratory
mixed-method study investigates how LLM-based chatbots can support voting
preparation. We deployed a VAA chatbot to 331 users before Germany's 2024
European Parliament election, gathering insights from surveys, conversation
logs, and 10 follow-up interviews. Participants found the VAA chatbot intuitive
and informative, citing its simple language and flexible interaction. We
further uncovered VAA chatbots' role as a catalyst for reflection and
rationalization. Expanding on participants' desire for transparency, we provide
design recommendations for building interactive and trustworthy VAA chatbots.

Motivation: 传统的XAI设计主要关注解释个体预测或系统行为，但忽略了解释作为沟通工具的作用。修辞设计提供了分析解释在用户与AI系统之间沟通作用的框架。

Method: 通过修辞设计的三个维度（逻辑推理、系统可信度和情感共鸣）分析XAI解释的作用，并综合现有设计策略。

Result: 修辞设计框架有助于理解解释如何影响用户感知并促进AI采用，同时也揭示了整合修辞设计的机遇与挑战。

Conclusion: 将修辞设计融入XAI系统设计可以提升解释的沟通效果，但需进一步研究以解决实际挑战。

Abstract: This paper explores potential benefits of incorporating Rhetorical Design
into the design of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. While XAI
is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall
system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping
how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster
appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the
communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on:
(1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2)
credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional
resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us
understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI
adoption. This paper synthesizes design strategies from prior XAI work that
align with these three rhetorical appeals and highlights both opportunities and
challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Reviewer的3D视觉界面，通过实时反馈优化肌电假肢的模式识别控制，显著提升了操作效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌电假肢的模式识别控制系统在复杂动作下难以生成可靠的EMG信号分类，用户需通过试错调整解码器边界。

Method: 研究通过10次实验，比较了使用Reviewer与传统虚拟手臂视觉反馈的训练效果，评估指标包括任务完成率和路径效率。

Result: 使用Reviewer的参与者表现出更高的任务完成率、更少的过冲和更优的路径效率。

Conclusion: 3D视觉反馈通过结构化训练显著提升了新手操作者的模式识别控制能力，减少了试错调整的依赖。

Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern
recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals
into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users
often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable
classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error
user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,
a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's
classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm
behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual,
data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder
boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants
compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the
Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was
assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and
the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer
achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path
efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group.
Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training,
facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control
improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this
approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more
adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual
feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through
structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance
on extensive heuristic adjustments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类活动识别（HAR）领域，获取高质量和多样化的数据仍然是一个挑战，主要由于高成本和真实世界活动的变异性。

Method: 使用注意力自动编码器和条件生成对抗网络生成数据集，并通过随机序列策略打乱数据以均匀分布。

Result: 实验结果显示，随机序列策略显著提升了分类性能，准确率达到0.70±0.03，宏观F1分数为0.64±0.01。

Conclusion: 通过打乱时间依赖性，模型更专注于瞬时识别，增强了鲁棒性，为复杂场景下的HAR系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), obtaining high quality and
variance data is still a persistent challenge due to high costs and the
inherent variability of real-world activities. This study introduces a
generation dataset by deep learning approaches (Attention Autoencoder and
conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). Another problem that data
heterogeneity is a critical challenge, one of the solutions is to shuffle the
data to homogenize the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the
random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance,
achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64
$\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence
reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby
improving robustness against activity transitions. This approach not only
broadens the effective training dataset but also offers promising avenues for
enhancing HAR systems in complex, real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了跨职能团队在AI开发早期阶段知识传递的挑战，并提出了AI LEGO工具以支持协作式危害识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨职能团队中技术专家与非技术角色之间知识传递的困难，以促进早期伦理评估和危害识别。

Method: 通过文献综述和与8位从业者的共同设计研究，开发了AI LEGO原型工具，支持技术与非技术角色协作识别危害。

Result: AI LEGO在18位从业者的研究中显著提高了危害识别的数量和可能性，并增强了协作性。

Conclusion: AI LEGO通过模块化结构和角色模拟，为早期设计阶段的负责任AI实践提供了更清晰的协作框架。

Abstract: Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of
addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through
social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work
is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of
transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical
experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm
identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8
practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design
choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by
non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to
support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without
scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google
Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint
harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to
align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based
prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively
facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the
early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft
development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through
stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface
potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO
increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline
worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts
made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more
collaborative RAI practices in early design.

Result: 在非独立均匀分布数据下，该方法能获取全局目标模型，性能优于其他攻击算法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于多种场景，为联邦学习安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks by malicious
adversaries. Existing methods often involve high costs to achieve effective
attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a sybil-based virtual data
poisoning attack, where a malicious client generates sybil nodes to amplify the
poisoning model's impact. To reduce neural network computational complexity, we
develop a virtual data generation method based on gradient matching. We also
design three schemes for target model acquisition, applicable to online local,
online global, and offline scenarios. In simulation, our method outperforms
other attack algorithms since our method can obtain a global target model under
non-independent uniformly distributed data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在网络安全应用中的潜在风险，如数据泄露和恶意软件生成，以推动更安全的LLMs开发。

Method: 使用OWASP Top 10框架评估七种开源LLMs，并提出一种通过重写指令-响应对的安全对齐方法。

Result: 微调显著降低LLMs的安全性（如Llama 3.1 8B的安全评分从0.95降至0.15），但安全对齐方法可改善安全性。

Conclusion: 安全对齐方法为开发更安全的微调技术提供了可行路径，有助于推动LLMs在敏感领域的可信应用。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security
applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat
analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and
safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of
new malware. We present a systematic evaluation of safety risks in fine-tuned
LLMs for cyber security applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 for LLM
Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B,
Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B.
Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all
tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection
drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach
that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety
precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is
possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical
utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning
methodologies. This work offers a systematic evaluation for safety risks in
LLMs, enabling safer adoption of generative AI in sensitive domains, and
contributing towards the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically
aligned LLMs.

TL;DR: AttentionGuard是一个基于Transformer的框架，用于检测车辆编队系统中的异常行为，通过自注意力机制识别攻击，表现出高准确性和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆编队系统虽然能提高燃油效率和道路利用率，但容易受到内部认证用户的复杂攻击，可能导致灾难性碰撞，因此需要有效的异常行为检测方法。

Method: 提出AttentionGuard框架，利用多头Transformer编码器处理运动数据，区分正常行为和攻击行为，适用于多种编队场景。

Result: 实验结果显示，AttentionGuard在攻击检测中F1分数高达0.95，且在复杂操作中保持稳健性能，延迟仅为100ms。

Conclusion: AttentionGuard展示了Transformer编码器在保护协作智能交通系统（C-ITS）免受内部威胁方面的潜力，具有实时性和高检测能力。

Abstract: Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated
through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits
in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to
sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can
destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This
paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning
systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for
misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify
anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head
transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling
effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification
attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state
(no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an
extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant,
gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller
types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results
demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack
detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers.
Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision
intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety
applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and
establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider
threats.

due to the centralized processing of sensitive user data. Private Transformer
Inference (PTI) offers a solution by utilizing cryptographic techniques such as

while preserving both user data and model privacy. This paper reviews recent
PTI advancements, highlighting state-of-the-art solutions and challenges. We
also introduce a structured taxonomy and evaluation framework for PTI, focusing
on balancing resource efficiency with privacy and bridging the gap between
high-performance inference and data privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A recent area of increasing research is the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in penetration testing, which promises to reduce costs and thus allow
for higher frequency. We conduct a review of related work, identifying best
practices and common evaluation issues. We then present AutoPentest, an
application for performing black-box penetration tests with a high degree of
autonomy. AutoPentest is based on the LLM GPT-4o from OpenAI and the LLM agent
framework LangChain. It can perform complex multi-step tasks, augmented by
external tools and knowledge bases. We conduct a study on three
capture-the-flag style Hack The Box (HTB) machines, comparing our
implementation AutoPentest with the baseline approach of manually using the
ChatGPT-4o user interface. Both approaches are able to complete 15-25 % of the
subtasks on the HTB machines, with AutoPentest slightly outperforming ChatGPT.
We measure a total cost of \$96.20 US when using AutoPentest across all
experiments, while a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus costs \$20. The
results show that further implementation efforts and the use of more powerful
LLMs released in the future are likely to make this a viable part of
vulnerability management.

TL;DR: AACT系统通过学习SOC分析师对安全警报的分类行为，自动化处理良性警报并优先处理关键警报，显著减少分析师的工作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业网络攻击面扩大导致安全警报激增，SOC分析师因处理大量良性警报而疲劳，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: AACT通过学习分析师对警报的分类行为，实时预测分类决策，自动关闭良性警报并优先处理关键警报。

Result: 在真实SOC环境和开放数据集上表现优异，减少61%的警报展示，误报率仅为1.36%。

Conclusion: AACT系统有效缓解了SOC分析师的警报疲劳，提升了工作效率和威胁检测能力。

Abstract: Enterprise networks are growing ever larger with a rapidly expanding attack
surface, increasing the volume of security alerts generated from security
controls. Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to
identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the
overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC
providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited
visibility into business processes.
  A novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by
learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately
predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed
automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue
allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats.
The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open
dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign
alerts.
  Additionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC
environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a
low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯组分物性预测在过程集成和多尺度建模中至关重要，现有方法需要更准确且可解释的预测框架。

Method: 采用基于连接矩阵的分子表示方法生成特征，结合随机森林进行特征筛选，并引入调整R2评估特征贡献。使用人工神经网络和高斯过程回归模型进行预测。

Result: 测试集上的均方根误差比传统方法降低83.8%，特征数量从13316降至100且不影响精度。特征分析表明不同物性受不同结构特征影响。

Conclusion: 该框架可行且为混合物组分重构和过程集成建模提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of pure component physiochemical properties is crucial
for process integration, multiscale modeling, and optimization. In this work,
an enhanced framework for pure component property prediction by using
explainable machine learning methods is proposed. In this framework, the
molecular representation method based on the connectivity matrix effectively
considers atomic bonding relationships to automatically generate features. The
supervised machine learning model random forest is applied for feature ranking
and pooling. The adjusted R2 is introduced to penalize the inclusion of
additional features, providing an assessment of the true contribution of
features. The prediction results for normal boiling point (Tb), liquid molar
volume, critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) obtained using
Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Process Regression models confirm the
accuracy of the molecular representation method. Comparison with GC based
models shows that the root-mean-square error on the test set can be reduced by
up to 83.8%. To enhance the interpretability of the model, a feature analysis
method based on Shapley values is employed to determine the contribution of
each feature to the property predictions. The results indicate that using the
feature pooling method reduces the number of features from 13316 to 100 without
compromising model accuracy. The feature analysis results for Tb, Tc, and Pc
confirms that different molecular properties are influenced by different
structural features, aligning with mechanistic interpretations. In conclusion,
the proposed framework is demonstrated to be feasible and provides a solid
foundation for mixture component reconstruction and process integration
modelling.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Difference-in-Differences Bayesian Causal Forest
(DiD-BCF), a novel non-parametric model addressing key challenges in DiD
estimation, such as staggered adoption and heterogeneous treatment effects.
DiD-BCF provides a unified framework for estimating Average (ATE),

enhances estimation accuracy and stability in complex panel data settings.
Extensive simulations demonstrate DiD-BCF's superior performance over
established benchmarks, particularly under non-linearity, selection biases, and
effect heterogeneity. Applied to U.S. minimum wage policy, the model uncovers
significant conditional treatment effect heterogeneity related to county
population, insights obscured by traditional methods. DiD-BCF offers a robust
and versatile tool for more nuanced causal inference in modern DiD
applications.

Motivation: 电视用户面临众多频道和点播服务的选择，个性化推荐能节省用户时间。但关键挑战在于理解多人观看时的行为，以及如何结合个人偏好为群体推荐。

Method: 采用高斯混合模型平均法估计家庭电视观看行为的个人偏好数量，并使用贝叶斯随机游走模型引入不确定性。

Result: 基于50万条真实用户数据的实验表明，该框架能有效估计家庭观看偏好数量及其特征，包括时间变化和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为家庭电视观看行为的个性化推荐提供了有效解决方案，尤其在多人观看场景下表现优异。

Abstract: TV customers today face many choices from many live channels and on-demand
services. Providing a personalised experience that saves customers time when
discovering content is essential for TV providers. However, a reliable
understanding of their behaviour and preferences is key. When creating
personalised recommendations for TV, the biggest challenge is understanding
viewing behaviour within households when multiple people are watching. The
objective is to detect and combine individual profiles to make
better-personalised recommendations for group viewing. Our challenge is that we
have little explicit information about who is watching the devices at any time
(individuals or groups). Also, we do not have a way to combine more than one
individual profile to make better recommendations for group viewing. We propose
a novel framework using a Gaussian mixture model averaging to obtain point
estimates for the number of household TV profiles and a Bayesian random walk
model to introduce uncertainty. We applied our approach using data from real
customers whose TV-watching data totalled approximately half a million
observations. Our results indicate that combining our framework with the
selected features provides a means to estimate the number of household TV
profiles and their characteristics, including shifts over time and
quantification of uncertainty.

Abstract: We describe an algorithm for sampling a low-rank random matrix $Q$ that best

$\mathbb{E}\|P-Q\|_F^2$. Our algorithm mirrors the solution to the efficient

Abstract: We investigate the efficient learning of magnetic phases using artificial
neural networks trained on synthetic data, combining computational simplicity
with physics-informed strategies. Focusing on the diluted Ising model, which
lacks an exact analytical solution, we explore two complementary approaches: a
supervised classification using simple dense neural networks, and an
unsupervised detection of phase transitions using convolutional autoencoders
trained solely on idealized spin configurations.
  To enhance model performance, we incorporate two key forms of
physics-informed guidance. First, we exploit architectural biases which
preferentially amplify features related to symmetry breaking. Second, we
include training configurations that explicitly break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry,
reinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms,
acting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in
the absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions
through comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and
percolation thresholds.
  Our results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient
training schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in
complex systems. This framework offers a low-cost and robust alternative to
conventional methods, with potential applications in broader condensed matter
and statistical physics contexts.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the issue of inconsistency handling in DatalogMTL,
an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators. Since facts are
associated with time intervals, there are different manners to restore
consistency when they contradict the rules, such as removing facts or modifying
their time intervals. Our first contribution is the definition of relevant
notions of conflicts (minimal explanations for inconsistency) and repairs
(possible ways of restoring consistency) for this setting and the study of the
properties of these notions and the associated inconsistency-tolerant
semantics. Our second contribution is a data complexity analysis of the tasks
of generating a single conflict / repair and query entailment under
repair-based semantics.

Motivation: 通过深度学习技术改进学前课堂语音交互的分析，为教育研究和干预策略提供更准确的数据支持。

Method: 整合wav2vec2的说话人分类和Whisper的语音转录技术，分析235分钟的课堂录音并与专家标注对比。

Result: WSW2.0在说话人分类和转录质量上表现良好，F1分数0.845，转录错误率较低（教师0.119，儿童0.238）。

Conclusion: WSW2.0展示了深度学习在教育研究中的潜力，能够支持早期语言发展和干预策略的优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces an automated framework WSW2.0 for analyzing vocal
interactions in preschool classrooms, enhancing both accuracy and scalability
through the integration of wav2vec2-based speaker classification and Whisper
(large-v2 and large-v3) speech transcription. A total of 235 minutes of audio
recordings (160 minutes from 12 children and 75 minutes from 5 teachers), were
used to compare system outputs to expert human annotations. WSW2.0 achieves a
weighted F1 score of .845, accuracy of .846, and an error-corrected kappa of
.672 for speaker classification (child vs. teacher). Transcription quality is
moderate to high with word error rates of .119 for teachers and .238 for
children. WSW2.0 exhibits relatively high absolute agreement intraclass
correlations (ICC) with expert transcriptions for a range of classroom language
features. These include teacher and child mean utterance length, lexical
diversity, question asking, and responses to questions and other utterances,
which show absolute agreement intraclass correlations between .64 and .98. To
establish scalability, we apply the framework to an extensive dataset spanning
two years and over 1,592 hours of classroom audio recordings, demonstrating the
framework's robustness for broad real-world applications. These findings
highlight the potential of deep learning and natural language processing
techniques to revolutionize educational research by providing accurate measures
of key features of preschool classroom speech, ultimately guiding more
effective intervention strategies and supporting early childhood language
development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为pc-dbCBS的运动规划方法，用于解决物理耦合多机器人系统在复杂环境中的高维运动规划问题，显著提升了规划效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在物理耦合多机器人系统的运动规划中表现不佳，缺乏理论保证，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 扩展了discontinuity-bounded CBS方法，提出了一种三层次冲突检测与解决框架，并交替使用状态空间表示。

Result: 在模拟和真实场景中，pc-dbCBS解决了更多实例（最高提升92%），规划时间减少一个数量级，轨迹速度提升50-60%。

Conclusion: pc-dbCBS是一种高效且理论完备的运动规划方法，适用于物理耦合多机器人系统。

Abstract: Motion planning problems for physically-coupled multi-robot systems in
cluttered environments are challenging due to their high dimensionality.
Existing methods combining sampling-based planners with trajectory optimization
produce suboptimal results and lack theoretical guarantees. We propose
Physically-coupled discontinuity-bounded Conflict-Based Search (pc-dbCBS), an
anytime kinodynamic motion planner, that extends discontinuity-bounded CBS to
rigidly-coupled systems. Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection
and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the
robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space
representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic
optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25
simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a
cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods,
pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and
plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an
order of magnitude.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ManipBench的新基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在机器人低层推理能力中的表现，填补了当前缺乏统一评测标准的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社区缺乏一个明确且通用的基准来评估VLMs在机器人低层推理（如精确运动决策）中的能力。

Method: 设计了ManipBench基准，涵盖物体间交互和可变形物体操作等多个维度，测试了33个代表性VLMs。

Result: VLMs在不同任务中表现差异显著，且其性能与实际操作任务趋势强相关，但与人类理解仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: ManipBench为评估VLMs的低层推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and
robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic
manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work
has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making
decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks
a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level
reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench,
to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs
across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object
interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33
representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including
variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the
performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong
correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation
tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models
and human-level understanding. See our website at:

TL;DR: FlowDreamer通过显式3D场景流预测未来视觉观测，在机器人操作任务中表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何训练更好的视觉世界模型，以预测机器人操作中的未来视觉观测。

Method: FlowDreamer采用3D场景流作为显式运动表示，结合U-Net和扩散模型预测未来帧。

Result: 在4个基准测试中，FlowDreamer在语义相似性、像素质量和成功率上分别提升7%、11%和6%。

Conclusion: FlowDreamer通过显式运动表示和模块化设计，显著提升了视觉世界模型的性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates training better visual world models for robot
manipulation, i.e., models that can predict future visual observations by
conditioning on past frames and robot actions. Specifically, we consider world
models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to
canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and
reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer,
which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer
first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a
U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the
scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature.
We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video
prediction and visual planning tasks. The results demonstrate that FlowDreamer
achieves better performance compared to other baseline RGB-D world models by 7%
on semantic similarity, 11% on pixel quality, and 6% on success rate in various
robot manipulation domains.

*Rathin Chandra Shit,Sharmila Subudhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多机器人任务分配（MRTA）和碰撞避免的新框架，通过空间聚类划分工作区，显著提升效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业环境中多机器人执行相同任务时的任务分配和碰撞避免问题。

Method: 使用K-means聚类和2-Opt算法划分任务区域并规划机器人路径。

Result: 时间减少93%（1.24s vs 17.62s），解决方案质量提升7%，完全消除碰撞点。

Conclusion: 空间分区统一了任务分配和碰撞避免问题，适用于计算效率和安全性要求高的实际应用。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel framework is presented that achieves a combined
solution based on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and collision avoidance
with respect to homogeneous measurement tasks taking place in industrial
environments. The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve
the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the
workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task
sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use
K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows
satisfactory performance, where up to 93\% time reduction (1.24s against
17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\% compared to the best
performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates
collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant
sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning
unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance
problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse
geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial
importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and
operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练数据集与机器人操作任务之间存在显著领域差距，且缺乏有效整合3D信息的模型架构。

Method: 通过增强DROID数据集（DROID-3D）并开发多模态掩码自编码器EmbodiedMAE，结合随机掩码和跨模态融合学习多模态表示。

Result: 在70个仿真任务和20个真实机器人操作任务中，EmbodiedMAE在训练效率和性能上均优于现有视觉基础模型。

Conclusion: EmbodiedMAE成为3D多模态视觉基础模型的可靠选择，尤其在需要精确空间感知的桌面操作场景中。

Abstract: We present EmbodiedMAE, a unified 3D multi-modal representation for robot
manipulation. Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between
training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model
architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome
these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps
and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D
embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked
autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and
point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion.
Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final
performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation
tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with
size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental
results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for
embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings
where spatial perception is critical.

Motivation: 传统避障方法在重复路径中效率低下，需依赖持续路径规划。

Result: 通过推动障碍物而非避障，优化多智能体长期路径效率。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于需要自主基础设施开发的非结构化环境，如月球或火星表面。

Abstract: In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the
predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path
planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an
indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the
obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that
will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and
lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we
propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured
environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic
manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates
exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of
obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our
preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both
the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation
module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle
via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our
navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple
agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in
environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as
lunar or Martian surfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，IL预训练后RL微调的两步学习范式在微调阶段常出现不稳定和样本效率低的问题，需要一种更高效稳定的方法。

Method: IN-RIL在RL微调过程中定期注入IL更新，并通过梯度分离机制将冲突的梯度更新分离到正交子空间。

Result: 在14个机器人任务上的实验表明，IN-RIL显著提高了样本效率，避免了性能崩溃，成功率达到6.3倍提升。

Conclusion: IN-RIL作为一种通用插件，兼容多种RL算法，能够显著提升RL微调的效果。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct
advantages for robotics policy learning: IL provides stable learning from
demonstrations, and RL promotes generalization through exploration. While
existing robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by
RL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often
suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning
phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning
and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL
updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of
IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout
the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization
objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive
interference during \ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting
gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes
learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot
manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including
FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \ABBR can
significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse
during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either
sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g.,
from 12\% to 88\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic
Transport. Project page: https://github.com/ucd-dare/IN-RIL.

Conclusion: 研究提供了DRL在ASV控制器部署中的有效训练策略和实际挑战的见解，并开源了实现代码。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for
Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), their robustness in real-world conditions,
particularly under external disturbances, remains insufficiently explored. In
this paper, we evaluate the resilience of a DRL-based agent designed to capture
floating waste under various perturbations. We train the agent using domain
randomization and evaluate its performance in real-world field tests, assessing
its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an
off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations
in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance
degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline. Results indicate that
the DRL agent performs reliably despite significant disturbances. Along with
the open-source release of our implementation, we provide insights into
effective training strategies, real-world challenges, and practical
considerations for deploying DRLbased ASV controllers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作中表现出潜力，但样本效率低且缺乏可解释性，限制了其实际应用。通过知识捕获和适应提升代理的理解和适应能力是关键。

Method: 提出KCAC框架，通过跨任务课程学习整合知识转移，重新设计奖励函数并定义子任务，优化学习效率。

Result: KCAC在训练时间减少40%的同时，任务成功率提高10%，并识别出优化学习效率的关键课程设计参数。

Conclusion: KCAC为基于课程的强化学习框架提供了概念指导，对机器人学习中的课程设计提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic
manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of
interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling
the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse
working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key
factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation,
and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer
into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two
block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic
manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to
solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In
this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid
constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards
concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two
self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to
facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40
percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10
percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we
identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing,
and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual
guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights
into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义的回退策略，无法规划通用的语义安全动作，且大型视觉和语言模型推理延迟高。

Method: FORTRESS结合多模态推理器和实时监控，动态生成回退目标并避免语义不安全区域。

Result: 在合成基准和真实机器人数据上，FORTRESS在安全分类准确性和规划成功率上表现优异。

Conclusion: FORTRESS通过开放世界多模态推理与动态规划结合，显著提升系统安全性和规划效率。

Abstract: Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate
safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data,
i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference
latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually
defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability
to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges
we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically
safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low
frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to
identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a
fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while
inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging
open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate
the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS
outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety
classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot
data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and
on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.

Motivation: 现有辅助摄像头路径规划方法未能同时考虑摄像头方向、工作空间约束和机器人关节限制，影响了手术中的空间感知和手动视角控制。

Method: 采用基于优先级的工作空间约束控制算法，结合启发式几何放置和非线性优化，实现高效的摄像头跟踪。

Conclusion: AutoCam证明了辅助摄像头可通过达芬奇患者侧机械臂自主控制跟踪显著特征，为RAMIS中多摄像头可视化方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.

Conclusion: 该研究为智能神经刺激接口领域开辟了新途径，并邀请机器学习社区参与贡献。

Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) has emerged as a promising treatment
for Parkinson disease (PD). In aDBS, a surgically placed electrode sends
dynamically altered stimuli to the brain based on neurophysiological feedback:
an invasive gadget that limits the amount of data one could collect for
optimizing the control offline. As a consequence, a plethora of synthetic
models of PD and those of the control algorithms have been proposed. Herein, we
introduce the first neurophysiologically realistic benchmark for comparing said
models. Specifically, our methodology covers not only conventional basal
ganglia circuit dynamics and pathological oscillations, but also captures 15
previously dismissed physiological attributes, such as signal instabilities and
noise, neural drift, electrode conductance changes and individual variability -
all modeled as spatially distributed and temporally registered features via
beta-band activity in the brain and a feedback. Furthermore, we purposely built
our framework as a structured environment for training and evaluating deep
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, opening new possibilities for
optimizing aDBS control strategies and inviting the machine learning community
to contribute to the emerging field of intelligent neurostimulation interfaces.

This paper introduces both a physical and cognitive model for perceiving the

early-arriving cosmic signals and reactive human delays intersect. We propose
experimental approaches to test these ideas using human neural observation and
neuro-receptive extensions. Finally, we propose a mathematical framework to
guide the evolution of AI systems toward temporally efficient, ethically sound,

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disease with millions of patients

efficacy and side effects of conventional antiepileptic drugs. In this study,
we developed a computational approach to optimize herbal epilepsy treatment
through AI-driven analysis of global natural products and statistically

meta-analysis of RCTs for evidence-based recommendations. The system analyzed
1,872 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and

clinical outcomes from 48 RCTs covering 48 epilepsy conditions (n=5,216). Using
LASSO regression and SHAP value analysis, we identified 17 high-efficacy herbs

somnifera), showing significant seizure reduction (p$<$0.01, Cohen's d=0.89)
with statistical significance confirmed by multiple testing (p$<$0.001). A

the Optuna TPE sampler and Hyperband pruner, as well as the Scikit-Learn
Gaussian process minimization. Initially, we use efficient low-fidelity sprints
to prune the hyperparameter space. Subsequent sprints progressively increase
their model fidelity and employ hyperband pruning for efficiency. A second

resolve classification probabilities during inference. We demonstrate our
method on a collection of variants of the 2021 Joint Entity and Relation

Method: 采用元学习框架，通过在多数据集上迭代优化系统提示和用户提示，确保二者协同。

Result: 在14个未见数据集上的实验表明，优化后的系统提示能有效泛化，且能快速适应新任务，减少优化步骤并提升性能。

Conclusion: 双层系统提示优化方法显著提升了LLMs的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with
optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their
performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic
system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt
optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or
tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized,
applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce
the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to
design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable
to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning
framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various
user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user
prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct
experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we
show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to
diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system
prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer
optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析开放式文本（如社交媒体帖子或标题）通常耗时且易受偏见影响，LLMs为解决这一问题提供了潜力。

Method: 通过逐步教程，结合研究人员与LLMs的协作，开发、测试和应用分类法，并以个人目标为例展示具体步骤。

Result: 展示了如何生成、评估和应用分类法，并实现了高编码一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs在文本分析中具有潜力，但也存在局限性，需进一步探讨。

Abstract: Analyzing texts such as open-ended responses, headlines, or social media
posts is a time- and labor-intensive process highly susceptible to bias. LLMs
are promising tools for text analysis, using either a predefined (top-down) or
a data-driven (bottom-up) taxonomy, without sacrificing quality. Here we
present a step-by-step tutorial to efficiently develop, test, and apply
taxonomies for analyzing unstructured data through an iterative and
collaborative process between researchers and LLMs. Using personal goals
provided by participants as an example, we demonstrate how to write prompts to
review datasets and generate a taxonomy of life domains, evaluate and refine
the taxonomy through prompt and direct modifications, test the taxonomy and
assess intercoder agreements, and apply the taxonomy to categorize an entire
dataset with high intercoder reliability. We discuss the possibilities and
limitations of using LLMs for text analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TokenAdapt框架，通过模型无关的tokenizer移植方法和多词Supertokens预分词学习，解决固定tokenization方案的低效问题，显著减少重新训练需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定tokenization方案在多语言或专业应用中导致低效和性能限制，现有方法计算资源消耗大且难以保留语义细节。

Method: 引入TokenAdapt（混合启发式初始化新token嵌入）和Supertokens预分词学习，结合局部子词分解和全局语义相似性估计。

Result: TokenAdapt在零样本困惑度上显著优于基线方法（如ReTok和TransTokenizer），困惑度比至少降低2倍。

Conclusion: TokenAdapt框架有效解决了tokenizer锁定的问题，同时显著提升了性能和压缩效率。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed
tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations,
particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer
lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this
often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer
replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing
methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully
preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression
inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a
model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel
pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and
reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a
hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword
decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the
top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This
methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing
retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions:
the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly
outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including
Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression
gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid
initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both
ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly
trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity
ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement
in these aggregate scores.

TL;DR: 该研究利用NLP技术（特别是NER）自动从电子健康记录中提取肺癌和乳腺癌的关键临床信息，使用uQuery工具和预训练的RoBERTa模型，取得了较高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床报告的手动提取信息耗时且易出错，限制了医疗数据驱动方法的效率，NLP技术可自动化这一过程。

Method: 使用GMV的uQuery工具和预训练的bsc-bio-ehr-en3模型（基于RoBERTa），对200份乳腺癌和400份肺癌报告进行NER任务。

Result: 整体性能良好，尤其在识别MET和PAT实体上表现突出，但对低频实体（如EVOL）仍有挑战。

Conclusion: NLP技术（如NER）可有效自动化临床信息提取，提高数据管理效率，但需进一步优化低频实体的识别。

Abstract: Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual
extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming
and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in
healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from
electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast
cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on
public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of
cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and
efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels
at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into
standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and
classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information,
including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In
this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity
Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical
information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health
Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast
cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities
manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the
bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained
in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture,
enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our
results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying
entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent
entities like EVOL.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM中存在一个通用的真理方向，但在不同对话格式中泛化能力有限，尤其是长对话。通过添加固定关键词可以改善泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM中真理方向在不同对话格式中的泛化能力，以提升LLM谎言检测的可靠性。

Method: 使用线性探针分析隐藏状态，测试真理方向在短对话和长对话中的泛化能力，并提出添加固定关键词的解决方案。

Result: 短对话中真理方向泛化良好，长对话中表现较差；添加固定关键词显著改善了长对话的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLM谎言检测在新场景中的泛化仍具挑战性，但通过特定方法可以部分解决。

Abstract: Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where
true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the
model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden
state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even
be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how
this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We
find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but
poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the
input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of
generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation.
Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that
generalize to new settings.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在预测暴力冲突方面的能力，比较了其参数化知识与非参数化能力（结合外部数据）的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言任务中表现优异，但其在冲突预测中的应用尚未充分探索，这对早期预警和人道主义规划至关重要。

Method: 通过两部分评估框架（参数化和非参数化设置），比较LLMs在仅依赖预训练知识或结合外部数据（如ACLED、GDELT和新闻）时的预测能力。

Result: 研究揭示了LLMs在冲突预测中的优势和局限性，并表明结合外部知识可显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在冲突预测中具有潜力，但需结合外部数据以弥补预训练知识的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across natural
language tasks, but their ability to forecast violent conflict remains
underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric
knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation
and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning
systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric
knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and
unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent
news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external
information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context
otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework
spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the
Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and
fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting,
models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and
geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g.,
Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against
historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs
for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured
external knowledge.

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的RAG方法能有效提升LLM生成个性化响应的准确性，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications,
including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and
other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs
often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra
and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of
the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and
personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response
generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing
continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can
be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar,
contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our
experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in
understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared
to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate
reduction in response time.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction has emerged as a promising objective for improving
language model pretraining, but its benefits have not consistently generalized
to other settings such as fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a
simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves
learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting
future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key
advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters,
requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf
pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining
objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning.
Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases,
including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and
pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision
domains. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/nasosger/MuToR.

Result: 攻击方法有效，许多LLMs仍存在漏洞，行业应对措施不足。

Conclusion: 随着LLMs的普及和开源化，滥用风险加剧，需采取果断措施防止危险知识的传播。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields
from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable
capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to
jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems
from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes
unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn
undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their
intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by
dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified
through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal
jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models,
enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon
request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months
ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack.
Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers
were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices
regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and
as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates.
Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to
dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.

Abstract: Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a
persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed
diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and
accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We
evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods
evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and
communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized
quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis
using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that
general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and
affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication
accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential
harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and
trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific
knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need
for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in
mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study
provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering
critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing
future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

Result: 框架比现有方法更具可解释性和全面性，并能预测和引导模型使用更有效的推理策略。

Conclusion: 训练数据格式对推理行为的影响大于数据领域，强调了格式感知模型设计的重要性。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) is an essential ingredient in effective usage of
modern large language models, but our understanding of the reasoning strategies
underlying these capabilities remains limited. While some prior works have
attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches
are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of
model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up
framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically
extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into
a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives
contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show
that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than
existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables
performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and
guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical
insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs.
multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data
domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)

for diverse applications, including tasks requiring nuanced textual
understanding and contextual reasoning. This study investigates the
capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA3,
Mistral 7B, and Claude-2 - for zero-shot and few-shot annotation of a complex
textual dataset comprising social media posts in Russian and Ukrainian.
Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying
references to human rights violations within the dataset.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared
against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000
samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different
prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian.
Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and
disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths,
limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.
  By juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes
to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive,
domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how
language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a
critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Language Modeling is a prevalent task in Natural Language Processing. The
currently existing most recent and most successful language models often tend
to build a massive model with billions of parameters, feed in a tremendous
amount of text data, and train with enormous computation resources which
require millions of dollars. In this project, we aim to address an important
sub-task in language modeling, i.e., context embedding. We propose an approach
to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and
use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context
of preceding words. We test this on the custom Wikipedia text corpus using a
very limited amount of resources and show that this approach works fairly well

Motivation: AI的发展受限于评估质量，而强大的LLM-as-a-Judge模型是核心解决方案。通过强化思维链推理能力，提升模型的判断能力。

Method: 采用强化学习方法J1，将可验证和不可验证的提示转化为具有可验证奖励的判断任务，激励模型思考并减少判断偏差。

Result: J1在8B和70B规模下训练时，优于所有现有模型，包括从DeepSeek-R1蒸馏的模型，甚至在某些基准测试中超过R1。

Conclusion: J1模型通过学习生成评估标准、对比自我生成的参考答案以及重新评估模型响应的正确性，显著提升了判断能力。

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, and powerful
LLM-as-a-Judge models have proved to be a core solution. Improved judgment
ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need
to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we
introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our
method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks
with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias.
In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models
when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1
also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a
smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs
Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies,
seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our
models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria,
comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the

*Yihong Dong,Yuchen Liu,Xue Jiang,Zhi Jin,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语法的解码方法RPG，用于解决代码生成中的结构重复问题，显著提升了生成代码的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型提升了代码生成性能，但重复问题（尤其是结构重复）仍然存在，现有研究多关注内容重复，而结构重复更具挑战性。

Method: RPG利用语法规则识别重复问题，并通过衰减关键令牌的似然来减少重复。

Result: RPG在CodeRepetEval、HumanEval和MBPP基准测试中显著优于基线方法，有效减少了重复并提升了代码质量。

Conclusion: RPG是一种高效的方法，能够显著缓解代码生成中的结构重复问题。

Abstract: With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation
has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the
generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on
content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition
problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is
structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in
various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently
reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition
and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for
Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems
in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to
identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically
decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,
thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we
construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches
for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the
best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and
MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of
generated code.

*Yoichi Ishibashi,Taro Yano,Masafumi Oyamada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过合成数据进行的推理持续预训练（Reasoning CPT）如何提升大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，并在多领域验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调和强化学习）在训练推理模型时局限于特定领域，而推理持续预训练（CPT）无需任务特定信号，但其数据合成和跨领域影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出Reasoning CPT，利用合成数据重建文本背后的隐藏思维过程，应用于Gemma2-9B模型，并与标准CPT在MMLU基准上对比。

Result: Reasoning CPT在所有评估领域均表现更优，推理能力可跨领域迁移，且在难题上性能提升显著（最高8分）。模型还能根据问题难度调整推理深度。

Conclusion: Reasoning CPT是一种有效的跨领域推理训练方法，尤其在复杂问题上表现突出，为LLM的通用推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are
primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,
which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of
training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of
not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively
synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of
domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of
Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden
thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the
result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT
to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and
Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis
reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all
evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer
effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as
problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most
challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to
adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.

*Filippo Olimpieri,Noemi Giustini,Andrea Lacava,Salvatore D'Oro,Tommaso Melodia,Francesca Cuomo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于dApps和LibIQ库的实时RF频谱分类方法，解决了RIC在实时监控和数据隐私方面的限制，实现了高精度的信号分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN架构通过RIC实现网络监控，但存在延迟和数据隐私问题，限制了实时监控和某些用例（如波束成形和频谱分类）。

Method: 利用LibIQ库处理I/Q样本，通过CNN分类RF信号，并在5G部署和OTA测试床上验证。

Result: 模型在实时分析中平均准确率达到97.8%，能够高效识别不同信号类型。

Conclusion: LibIQ和数据集将公开，为实时频谱分析提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN
softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and
control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate
near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps.
However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange
between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to
access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use
cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage
the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a
novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and
signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as
time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and
spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to
detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN
inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an
extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct
signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the
Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by
deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies,
time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model
classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of
approximately 97.8\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We
pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available
framework upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于外核探测器实时测量数据重建核反应堆中子通量空间分布的方法，利用基尔霍夫-亥姆霍兹方程作为数学框架，并通过数值方法解决复杂域中的格林函数问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核反应堆中子通量的空间分布对反应堆安全与性能至关重要，但复杂域中的格林函数解析解难以获取，需通过数据驱动方法解决。

Method: 基于一速中子扩散模型推导基尔霍夫-亥姆霍兹方程，通过数值方法近似格林函数，并利用传感器数据重建中子通量分布。

Result: 证明了从采样数据推断的格林函数的存在性和唯一性，验证了方法的可靠性和预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂域中子通量重建提供了可靠的数据驱动解决方案，适用于核反应堆监测与优化。

Abstract: This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution
of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements
obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation
inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain
based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this
task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the
domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for
Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex,
heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach.
The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the
data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H
equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that
the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the
one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive
description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing
the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and
uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are
demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its
predictions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动生成图表语义洞察的训练数据开发流程，并基于此训练了CLIP模型ChartFinder，显著提升了文本到图表检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图表检索系统因缺乏全面的语义洞察而表现不佳，无法满足精确和模糊查询的需求。

Method: 开发了自动生成图表语义洞察的流程，包括视觉模式、统计属性和实际应用，并训练了CLIP模型ChartFinder。

Result: ChartFinder在精确查询中NDCG@10达到66.9%，比现有方法高11.58%；在模糊查询中平均提升5%。

Conclusion: 通过丰富语义洞察训练模型，ChartFinder在文本到图表检索任务中表现优异，为BI应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Charts are crucial for data analysis and decision-making.Text-to-chart
retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence
(BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical
needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are
well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require
understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing
text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content
and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of
comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we
propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes
hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns
(visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical
applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for
69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to
learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method
leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model
that understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate
text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench,
for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI
applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd
workers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing
methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise
queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than
state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates
consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all
metrics.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否记忆了公开推荐数据集（如MovieLens-1M），并分析了记忆对推荐性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLMs在推荐任务中的应用，但忽视了其是否记忆了公开数据集，这可能影响研究结果的泛化性和加剧偏见。

Method: 通过定义数据集记忆（如项目属性、用户画像和交互的检索能力），分析记忆对推荐性能的影响，并比较不同模型家族和大小的记忆差异。

Result: 所有模型均表现出对MovieLens-1M的记忆，推荐性能与记忆程度相关。

Conclusion: LLMs确实记忆了公开推荐数据集，记忆程度影响推荐性能，需在研究中注意这一问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to
recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding
and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use
of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to
verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of
their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the
generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets
does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization
can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more
frequently than others.
  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public
recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and
Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset
in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as
the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions
can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of
memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether
memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal
that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that
recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have
made all the code publicly available at:

Abstract: This paper introduces LAV (Latent Audio-Visual), a system that integrates
EnCodec's neural audio compression with StyleGAN2's generative capabilities to
produce visually dynamic outputs driven by pre-recorded audio. Unlike previous
works that rely on explicit feature mappings, LAV uses EnCodec embeddings as
latent representations, directly transformed into StyleGAN2's style latent
space via randomly initialized linear mapping. This approach preserves semantic
richness in the transformation, enabling nuanced and semantically coherent
audio-visual translations. The framework demonstrates the potential of using
pretrained audio compression models for artistic and computational
applications.

Abstract: This paper focuses on explaining the timbre conveyed by speech signals and
introduces a task termed voice timbre attribute detection (vTAD). In this task,
voice timbre is explained with a set of sensory attributes describing its human
perception. A pair of speech utterances is processed, and their intensity is

which is built upon the speaker embeddings extracted from the speech
utterances. The investigation is conducted on the VCTK-RVA dataset.
Experimental examinations on the ECAPA-TDNN and FACodec speaker encoders
demonstrated that: 1) the ECAPA-TDNN speaker encoder was more capable in the
seen scenario, where the testing speakers were included in the training set; 2)
the FACodec speaker encoder was superior in the unseen scenario, where the
testing speakers were not part of the training, indicating enhanced
generalization capability. The VCTK-RVA dataset and open-source code are

Abstract: Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling
distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to
handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration
of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important
effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking
amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of
ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning
approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used
to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from
data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with
neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical
systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear
vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for
nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily
accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the
network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic
data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained
to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are
presented.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全认证器对RL控制器进行短视干预，可能导致不理想的平衡点。本文旨在通过联合学习RL和安全控制器，实现高置信度的安全性，同时减少数据需求和计算复杂度。

Method: 1) 学习分段仿射控制器以扩大不变集；2) 通过决策变量和噪声建模闭环系统；3) 设计决策变量以最小化安全违规概率；4) 提出数据驱动的插值技术整合RL和安全控制器。

Result: 该方法减少了数据需求，降低了安全违规的方差，并通过仿真验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 联合学习RL和安全控制器的方法在保证安全性的同时，提高了控制效率和计算可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control
design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety
certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe
controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe
controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this
approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a
high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic
interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by
deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly
efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing
over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To
learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers
are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system
is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The
effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the
closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such
that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is
minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data
requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to
integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation
technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal
implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by
noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate
the theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准EP估计方法在高维系统中因计算和统计限制难以应用，需要一种无需重构高维概率分布或速率矩阵的新方法。

Method: 利用非平衡最大熵原理和凸对偶性，通过轨迹观测样本推断EP，无需特殊假设或复杂计算。

Result: 方法在1000自旋无序非平衡自旋模型和大型神经尖峰数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算EP层次分解的途径，具有直观的物理意义，适用于复杂系统。

Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional
stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with
long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such
systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer
trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a
nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex
duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as
spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of
high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special
assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to
compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from
different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical
interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its
numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins
and a large neural spike-train dataset.

SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the
non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives
within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold,
referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major
challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to
overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn
increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients
and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal
Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological
inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units
for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while
preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF
effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on
multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing
rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy. The code is available at
github.com/kaisun1/ILIF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床教育模式无法满足放疗计划质量教育的需求，缺乏灵活性和多样化的案例。

Method: 结合剂量分布预测与自然语言处理，生成次优训练计划并允许学员通过自然语言提示改进计划。

Result: 开发了一个快速、准确且资源需求低的剂量生成与修改系统。

Conclusion: 该模型为放疗计划质量教育提供了高效工具，填补了当前临床教育模式的空白。

Abstract: Effective education in radiotherapy plan quality review requires a robust,
regularly updated set of examples and the flexibility to demonstrate multiple
possible planning approaches and their consequences. However, the current
clinic-based paradigm does not support these needs. To address this, we have
developed 'Virtual Dosimetrist' models that can both generate training examples
of suboptimal treatment plans and then allow trainees to improve the plan
quality through simple natural language prompts, as if communicating with a
dosimetrist. The dose generation and modification process is accurate, rapid,
and requires only modest resources. This work is the first to combine dose
distribution prediction with natural language processing; providing a robust
pipeline for both generating suboptimal training plans and allowing trainees to
practice their critical plan review and improvement skills that addresses the
challenges of the current clinic-based paradigm.

TL;DR: VRSplat通过结合和改进3DGS技术，解决了VR中的时间伪影、投影失真和帧率问题，实现了72+ FPS的高性能渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在VR中面临时间伪影、投影失真和帧率下降等问题，这些问题在头戴显示器中尤为突出。

Method: 结合Mini-Splatting、StopThePop和Optimal Projection技术，改进3DGS光栅化器，并提出高效的中心凹光栅化器。

Result: 用户研究表明VRSplat优于其他配置，实现了72+ FPS且消除了伪影和失真。

Conclusion: VRSplat是首个系统评估的3DGS方法，支持现代VR应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for
novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient
software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time
applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS
faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as
popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in
disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when
rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for
VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by
large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of
head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine
and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR
holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal
Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques
and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated
rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch,
avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also
incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on
StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method
through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong
preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is
the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern
VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and
stereo-disrupting floaters.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段的SVG风格定制生成方法，结合了前馈T2V模型和T2I先验，解决了现有方法在风格定制和结构一致性上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到矢量（T2V）生成方法忽视了风格定制的需求，而优化和直接生成方法各有不足，需要一种兼顾结构一致性和风格多样性的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）训练路径级表示的T2V扩散模型以确保结构一致性；2）通过蒸馏定制T2I模型实现风格定制。

Result: 实验验证了该方法能高效生成高质量、多样化的定制风格SVG。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法成功解决了风格定制与结构一致性的平衡问题，为SVG生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their
resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing
text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they
often overlook an important need in practical applications: style
customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics
with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing
T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.
Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I)
models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.
On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity,
yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to
limited SVG training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization
pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward
T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion
model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of
SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we
customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized
T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate
high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an
efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been
validated through extensive experiments. The project page is

Result: 讨论了治理和决策过程，并指出实施标准需要适当的安全管理实践及其他文化、程序和操作考虑。

Conclusion: 总结了局限性，提醒希望复制其内容的读者需注意相关限制。

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of how the determination of absence of
unreasonable risk can be operationalized. It complements previous theoretical
work published by existing developers of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) on the
overall engineering practices and methodologies for readiness determination.
Readiness determination is, at its core, a risk assessment process. It is aimed
at evaluating the residual risk associated with the deployment of a new
software release candidate. The paper proposes methodological criteria to
ground the readiness review process for an ADS release. While informed by
Waymo's experience in this domain, the criteria presented are agnostic of any
specific ADS technological solution and/or architectural choice, to support
broad implementation by others in the industry. The paper continues with a
discussion on governance and decision-making toward approval of a new software
release candidate for the ADS. The implementation of the presented criteria
requires the existence of appropriate safety management practices in addition
to many other cultural, procedural, and operational considerations. As such,
the paper is concluded by a statement of limitations for those wishing to
replicate part or all of its content.

Motivation: 程序员常忽视单元测试的设计与实现，研究旨在评估LLMs在自动生成测试用例中的潜力。

Method: 开发了优化的提示，整合代码和需求，覆盖关键用例（如等价类和边界值），并通过定量指标和人工定性分析比较LLMs与人工测试的优劣。

Result: LLMs的效果取决于提示设计、实现和需求精度，虽灵活有潜力但仍需人工监督。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人工定性分析作为单元测试评估中自动化的重要补充。

Abstract: The design and implementation of unit tests is a complex task many
programmers neglect. This research evaluates the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with
manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and
requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and
boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained
programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative
analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on
well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements.
Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This
work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential
complement to automation in unit test evaluation.

TL;DR: SAEs（稀疏自编码器）被探索为一种轻量级、可解释的替代方案，用于检测Java函数中的漏洞，无需微调预训练LLMs，F1分数高达89%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统漏洞检测方法存在高误报率、扩展性问题和依赖人工的局限性，AI方法尤其是LLMs的应用虽有效但复杂且不透明，SAEs有望解决这些问题。

Method: 研究SAEs在GPT-2 Small和Gemma 2B的表示中的应用，评估其在不微调LLMs的情况下检测漏洞的能力。

Result: SAEs在漏洞检测中F1分数达89%，优于微调的Transformer编码器基线。

Conclusion: SAEs可直接从预训练LLMs的内部表示中检测漏洞，无需微调或任务特定监督，为首次实证。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a
major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability
detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates,
scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have
driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and
secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new
avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges
for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising
solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight,
interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the
effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and
Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without
fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug
detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned
transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence
that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal
representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific
supervision.

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在Python程序推理中的能力，发现部分模型（如Llama3.2）在高达61%的情况下基于错误逻辑得出正确预测，且对代码变异的鲁棒性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM在编程任务中的推理能力和鲁棒性对其可靠使用至关重要，但目前研究多关注预测准确性而非推理逻辑。

Method: 通过五种语义保留的代码变异（如变量重命名、分支交换等）评估六种LLM，并结合LiveCodeBench和CruxEval进行专家分析和预测稳定性测试。

Result: 部分LLM（如Llama3.2）在61%的案例中基于错误逻辑得出正确预测，且对代码变异的响应不稳定。

Conclusion: LLM在代码理解中的推理能力和鲁棒性存在显著缺陷，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have
assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the
accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them.
Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can
arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar
issues in code understanding.
  In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B
parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply
five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring
comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to
while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while
altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert
analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are
based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across
different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that
some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed
reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in
response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic
understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于基础模型的无线定位解决方案（LWLM），通过自监督学习框架优化三个互补目标，显著提升了定位任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动方法在无线定位中需要大量标注数据且泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 设计了一个自监督学习框架，结合空间-频率掩码信道建模（SF-MCM）、域变换不变性（DTI）和位置不变对比学习（PICL）三个目标，并开发轻量级解码器用于下游任务。

Result: LWLM在所有定位任务中均优于基于模型和监督学习的基线方法，性能提升26.0%--87.5%，并在标签有限和未见过的基站配置下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LWLM作为无线定位的基础模型具有巨大潜力，能够显著提升定位精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G
applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart
manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing
models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across
deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless
localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)
tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on
information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a
pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model
(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three
complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling
(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)
position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly
capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple
perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,
including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,
single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.
Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses
both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization
tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer
models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under
label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its
potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ImplicitStainer的新方法，通过局部隐式函数改进虚拟染色技术，减少数据需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色无法提供全部诊断信息，而IHC染色耗时且资源密集。虚拟染色技术通过深度学习生成IHC染色图像，但现有方法数据需求高。

Method: 采用局部隐式函数进行像素级预测，优化图像翻译性能，减少数据依赖。

Result: 在两种数据集上验证，性能优于15种现有GAN和扩散模型，数据需求更低。

Conclusion: ImplicitStainer在虚拟染色中表现优异，适用于数据有限场景，代码将公开。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a gold standard for microscopic
diagnosis in pathology. However, H&E staining does not capture all the
diagnostic information that may be needed. To obtain additional molecular
information, immunohistochemical (IHC) stains highlight proteins that mark
specific cell types, such as CD3 for T-cells or CK8/18 for epithelial cells.
While IHC stains are vital for prognosis and treatment guidance, they are
typically only available at specialized centers and time consuming to acquire,
leading to treatment delays for patients. Virtual staining, enabled by deep
learning-based image translation models, provides a promising alternative by
computationally generating IHC stains from H&E stained images. Although many
GAN and diffusion based image to image (I2I) translation methods have been used
for virtual staining, these models treat image patches as independent data
points, which results in increased and more diverse data requirements for
effective generation. We present ImplicitStainer, a novel approach that
leverages local implicit functions to improve image translation, specifically
virtual staining performance, by focusing on pixel-level predictions. This
method enhances robustness to variations in dataset sizes, delivering
high-quality results even with limited data. We validate our approach on two
datasets using a comprehensive set of metrics and benchmark it against over
fifteen state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion based models. Full Code and models
trained will be released publicly via Github upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有序子集的多扩散模型（OSMM），用于稀疏视图CT重建，通过分块学习和全局约束提升图像细节和噪声鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在处理未处理的稀疏视图CT数据时学习效率低且难以捕捉细节，导致重建图像质量不佳。

Method: 将CT投影数据分为等量子集，使用多子集扩散模型（MSDM）独立学习每个子集，并结合完整数据的全局扩散模型（OWDM）作为约束。

Result: OSMM在图像质量和噪声鲁棒性上优于传统扩散模型，适应不同稀疏程度的临床场景。

Conclusion: OSMM为稀疏视图CT重建提供了一种高效、鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have shown significant promise in the field of
sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, the projection dataset is large and
riddled with redundancy. Consequently, applying the diffusion model to
unprocessed data results in lower learning effectiveness and higher learning
difficulty, frequently leading to reconstructed images that lack fine details.
To address these issues, we propose the ordered-subsets multi-diffusion model
(OSMM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The OSMM innovatively divides the CT
projection data into equal subsets and employs multi-subsets diffusion model
(MSDM) to learn from each subset independently. This targeted learning approach
reduces complexity and enhances the reconstruction of fine details.
Furthermore, the integration of one-whole diffusion model (OWDM) with complete
sinogram data acts as a global information constraint, which can reduce the
possibility of generating erroneous or inconsistent sinogram information.
Moreover, the OSMM's unsupervised learning framework provides strong robustness
and generalizability, adapting seamlessly to varying sparsity levels of CT
sinograms. This ensures consistent and reliable performance across different
clinical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OSMM outperforms
traditional diffusion models in terms of image quality and noise resilience,
offering a powerful and versatile solution for advanced CT imaging in
sparse-view scenarios.

Motivation: 纯提示驱动的生成语义通信系统在6G网络中虽能降低通信成本，但会丢失视觉细节，且缺乏系统性能评估指标。

Method: 提出语义过滤方法选择并传输图像的关键语义特征，结合文本提示和关键特征，利用扩散生成模型重建高保真图像；设计GVIF指标量化生成图像的视觉质量。

Result: GVIF指标对视觉保真度敏感，与PSNR和关键信息量相关；优化系统在PSNR和FID分数上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 混合Gen-SemCom系统通过CIE框架和GVIF指标有效提升了生成图像的视觉质量和系统性能。

Abstract: Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial
intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks,
which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts
rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses
fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic
metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these
issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information
embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical
features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic
filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features
of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and
critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a
diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual
information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the
generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,
the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted
features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we
design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume
of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental
results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating
with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized
system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of
higher PSNR and lower FID scores.

Result: 在GCM 2025和BraTS 2021数据集上验证，Dice分数提升1.68%，且鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: HWA-UNETR和GCM 2025数据集为胃癌多模态分割提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the
context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by
the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to
amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are
constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration,
leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis
accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions:
First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first
large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans,
featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500
patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework
that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to
establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities'
anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba
mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies.
Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021
dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new
approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while
maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via

of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go
undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser
Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable
spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three
capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral
diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast
imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We
validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical
colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold
improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference
compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal
multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating
into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to
improve gastrointestinal imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NFA规范化问题中探索空间过大的问题，提升性能，尤其是在最坏情况下。

Method: 引入中间最小化步骤和等价注册表，结合凸闭包或模拟等优化技术，适用于经典子集构造或Brzozowski方法。

Conclusion: 方法具有通用性，已实现为开源库，可供用户实验。

Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the NFA canonization problem, which
introduces intermediate minimization steps to reduce the exploration space
on-the-fly. Essential to our approach are so-called equivalence registries
which manage information about equivalent states and allow for incorporating
further optimization techniques such as convexity closures or simulation to
boost performance. Due to the generality of our approach, these concepts can be
embedded in classic subset construction or Brzozowski's approach. We evaluate
our approach on a set of real-world examples from automatic sequences and
observe that we are able to improve especially worst-case scenarios. We
implement our approach in an open-source library for users to experiment with.

TL;DR: LanTu是一种基于动力学增强深度学习的区域涡旋分辨海洋预报系统，通过多尺度物理约束优化，显著提升了中尺度涡旋演化的预报能力，优于现有数值和AI预报系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中尺度涡旋对全球海洋能量级联有重要影响，但传统数值模型在涡旋分辨预报中面临科学挑战和高计算成本，AI预报系统需解决复杂多尺度特征的挑战。

Method: 开发LanTu系统，结合跨尺度相互作用和多尺度物理约束，通过动力学知识优化深度学习模型。

Result: LanTu在温度、盐度、海平面异常和流场预报上优于现有数值和AI系统，预报时效超过10天。

Conclusion: 动力学增强深度学习（LanTu）为中尺度涡旋分辨海洋预报提供了强大范式。

Abstract: Mesoscale eddies dominate the spatiotemporal multiscale variability of the
ocean, and their impact on the energy cascade of the global ocean cannot be
ignored. Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection
for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific
challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are
becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational
efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical
system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting
(especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep
learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct
multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy
dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale
evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced
operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean
forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and
current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights
that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting.

Motivation: 慢性心力衰竭管理需要持续监测和个性化治疗，机器学习模型可帮助早期识别高风险患者，支持决策。

Method: 采用改进的堆叠集成学习方法，结合两个专门模型（临床和超声心动图特征）和一个元模型。

Conclusion: 该模型可作为决策支持工具，助力早期干预和个性化管理，适用于PrediHealth项目及医疗专业人员。

Abstract: The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges
in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of
exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present
a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify
patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified
stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and
echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of
these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the
obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of
patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\%),
ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we
obtained 84\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However,
it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF
because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the
PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are
working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification
models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth
project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and
personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value
and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results
with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results
indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly
consider features, \ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic
features.

Motivation: 量化神经网络中输入特征的因果影响是当前研究热点，但现有方法通常关注直接、间接和总因果效应，忽略了内在因果贡献。

Method: 将神经网络视为结构因果模型（SCM），提出了一种可识别的生成后验框架来量化ICC，并将其与Sobol指数关联。

Conclusion: ICC为神经网络输入特征的因果解释提供了更有效的方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantifying the causal influence of input features within neural networks has
become a topic of increasing interest. Existing approaches typically assess
direct, indirect, and total causal effects. This work treats NNs as structural
causal models (SCMs) and extends our focus to include intrinsic causal
contributions (ICC). We propose an identifiable generative post-hoc framework
for quantifying ICC. We also draw a relationship between ICC and Sobol'
indices. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
ICC generates more intuitive and reliable explanations compared to existing
global explanation techniques.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating differences in two multi-attribute
Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) which are known to have similar structure,
using a penalized D-trace loss function with non-convex penalties. The GGM
structure is encoded in its precision (inverse covariance) matrix. Existing
methods for multi-attribute differential graph estimation are based on a group
lasso penalized loss function. In this paper, we consider a penalized D-trace
loss function with non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation
(SCAD)) penalties. Two proximal gradient descent methods are presented to
optimize the objective function. Theoretical analysis establishing sufficient
conditions for consistency in support recovery, convexity and estimation in
high-dimensional settings is provided. We illustrate our approaches with
numerical examples based on synthetic and real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和工业应用中，获取大量空间分布数据（如气候模型）成本高昂，而传统MLE方法计算复杂，尤其是对大规模非平稳场。

Method: 利用SAR模型的参数可以排列在规则网格上的特点，将输入（空间场）和输出（模型参数）视为图像，采用I2I网络进行参数估计。

Result: I2I网络实现了更快、更准确的参数估计，适用于前所未有的复杂非平稳SAR模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效模拟合成空间场提供了一种新途径，尤其适用于数据获取成本高的场景。

Abstract: In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of
instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field')
but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global
temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers,
and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively
expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers
an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields.
However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is
computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus,
many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial
fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a
popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a
simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on
a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can
be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image
(I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class
of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.

Result: 新方法在大多数情况下与商业求解器表现一致，少数情况下资产选择略有差异但组合方差误差可忽略。

Conclusion: 提出的梯度方法高效且可扩展，适用于稀疏投资组合优化问题。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization involves selecting asset weights to minimize a
risk-reward objective, such as the portfolio variance in the classical
minimum-variance framework. Sparse portfolio selection extends this by imposing
a cardinality constraint: only $k$ assets from a universe of $p$ may be
included. The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer
quadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal
solution. However, the computational costs of such methods increase
exponentially with $k$ and $p$, making them too slow for problems of even
moderate size. We propose a fast and scalable gradient-based approach that
transforms the combinatorial sparse selection problem into a constrained
continuous optimization task via Boolean relaxation, while preserving
equivalence with the original problem on the set of binary points. Our
algorithm employs a tunable parameter that transmutes the auxiliary objective
from a convex to a concave function. This allows a stable convex starting
point, followed by a controlled path toward a sparse binary solution as the
tuning parameter increases and the objective moves toward concavity. In
practice, our method matches commercial solvers in asset selection for most
instances and, in rare instances, the solution differs by a few assets whilst
showing a negligible error in portfolio variance.

Method: 使用路径梯度微调Flow Matching训练的CNFs，并测量流轨迹长度。

Result: 采样效率提升三倍，且流结构得以保留。

Conclusion: 路径梯度微调是一种高效且无需额外采样的改进方法。

Abstract: Boltzmann Generators have emerged as a promising machine learning tool for
generating samples from equilibrium distributions of molecular systems using
Normalizing Flows and importance weighting. Recently, Flow Matching has helped
speed up Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), scale them to more complex
molecular systems, and minimize the length of the flow integration
trajectories. We investigate the benefits of using path gradients to fine-tune
CNFs initially trained by Flow Matching, in the setting where a target energy
is known. Our experiments show that this hybrid approach yields up to a
threefold increase in sampling efficiency for molecular systems, all while
using the same model, a similar computational budget and without the need for
additional sampling. Furthermore, by measuring the length of the flow
trajectories during fine-tuning, we show that path gradients largely preserve
the learned structure of the flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单阶段L2D方法仅限于延迟到单一专家，无法适应多实体场景。

Method: 提出了一种成本敏感的损失函数和凸代理，独立于$k$，支持跨Top-$k$泛化，无需重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，Top-$k$方法优于Top-1延迟，且动态调整的Top-$k(x)$在准确性和成本间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为多实体延迟决策提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the first one-stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer framework, which
unifies prediction and deferral by learning a shared score-based model that
selects the $k$ most cost-effective entities-labels or experts-per input. While
existing one-stage L2D methods are limited to deferring to a single expert, our
approach jointly optimizes prediction and deferral across multiple entities
through a single end-to-end objective. We define a cost-sensitive loss and
derive a novel convex surrogate that is independent of the cardinality
parameter $k$, enabling generalization across Top-$k$ regimes without
retraining. Our formulation recovers the Top-1 deferral policy of prior
score-based methods as a special case, and we prove that our surrogate is both
Bayes-consistent and $\mathcal{H}$-consistent under mild assumptions. We
further introduce an adaptive variant, Top-$k(x)$, which dynamically selects
the number of consulted entities per input to balance predictive accuracy and
consultation cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN confirm that our one-stage
Top-$k$ method strictly outperforms Top-1 deferral, while Top-$k(x)$ achieves
superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by tailoring allocations to input complexity.

Result: 改进的HINTS算法在固定计算预算下获得最佳采样误差。

Conclusion: 子集评估和数据驱动代理的结合通过分层延迟接受实现了高效精确的采样。

Abstract: Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is challenging when
the likelihood function is irregular and expensive to compute. We explore
several sampling algorithms that make use of subset evaluations to reduce
computational overhead. We adapt the subset samplers for this setting where
gradient information is not available or is unreliable. To achieve this, we
introduce data-driven proxies in place of Taylor expansions and define a novel
computation-cost aware adaptive controller. We undertake an extensive
evaluation for a challenging disease modelling task and a configurable task
with similar irregularity in the likelihood surface. We find our improved
version of Hierarchical Importance with Nested Training Samples (HINTS), with
adaptive proposals and a data-driven proxy, obtains the best sampling error in
a fixed computational budget. We conclude that subset evaluations can provide
cheap and naturally-tempered exploration, while a data-driven proxy can
pre-screen proposals successfully in explored regions of the state space. These
two elements combine through hierarchical delayed acceptance to achieve
efficient, exact sampling.

Motivation: 多模态高维后验分布对变分推断提出挑战，传统退火方法需调参且效果有限。

Method: 通过条件调温同时处理基分布和目标分布，利用过参数化神经网络的泛化能力训练单一流。

Result: 在2、10和20维多模态分布实验中，FlowVAT优于传统方法，找到更多模式且ELBO值更高。

Conclusion: FlowVAT无需调参和退火计划，实现了对复杂后验的自动黑盒变分推断。

Abstract: Multi-modal and high-dimensional posteriors present significant challenges
for variational inference, causing mode-seeking behavior and collapse despite
the theoretical expressiveness of normalizing flows. Traditional annealing
methods require temperature schedules and hyperparameter tuning, falling short
of the goal of truly black-box variational inference. We introduce FlowVAT, a
conditional tempering approach for normalizing flow variational inference that
addresses these limitations. Our method tempers both the base and target
distributions simultaneously, maintaining affine-invariance under tempering. By
conditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized
neural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow
representing the posterior across a range of temperatures. This preserves modes
identified at higher temperatures when sampling from the variational posterior
at $T = 1$, mitigating standard variational methods' mode-seeking behavior. In
experiments with 2, 10, and 20 dimensional multi-modal distributions, FlowVAT
outperforms traditional and adaptive annealing methods, finding more modes and
achieving better ELBO values, particularly in higher dimensions where existing
approaches fail. Our method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and does not
require an annealing schedule, advancing toward fully-automatic black-box
variational inference for complicated posteriors.

Result: 在标准Lipschitz平滑和边界假设下，算法提供了接近最优的遗憾保证，并在实验中优于基于分箱的基线方法。

Conclusion: BaNk-UCB是一种高效且适应性强的算法，适用于有限反馈的批处理决策问题。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making in batched nonparametric contextual
bandits, where actions are selected over a finite horizon divided into a small
number of batches. Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and
marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric
algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the
upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully
nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement.
Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB
uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and
exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard
Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated
batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal
rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.

Conclusion: 结论指出，神经网络在EWS检测中具有潜力，但其泛化能力需进一步研究，尤其是在区分突变和连续相变时。

Abstract: Dryland vegetation ecosystems are known to be susceptible to critical
transitions between alternative stable states when subjected to external
forcing. Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of
bifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is
characteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and
diverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early
Warning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical
signatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong
predictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a
machine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can
effectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models'
capacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation
transitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase
transitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS
detection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models
can be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is
encoded in spatiotemporal dynamics. A few paradigmatic test systems are used to
illustrate how the capabilities of such models can be probed in a number of
ways, with particular attention to the performances of a number of proposed
statistical indicators for EWS and to the supplementary task of distinguishing
between abrupt and continuous transitions. Results reveal that model
performance often changes dramatically when training and test data sources are
interchanged, which offers new insight into the criteria for model
generalization.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML)
have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates
the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum
circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown
promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is
hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware
imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges.
To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential
scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters,
enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter
compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such
quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires
expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an
automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly
optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in
an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed
framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning
tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually
designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway
for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across
diverse applications.

Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for
temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature
maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance
in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum
reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical
computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory
retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order
unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we
show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with
increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir
iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with
quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates
generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast,
the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both
reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove
exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving
these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding
concentration in temporal quantum learning models.
