### [1] [Machine vs Machine: Using AI to Tackle Generative AI Threats in Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02046)
*Mohammad Saleh Torkestani,Taha Mansouri*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，通过机器对机器的方法解决生成式AI在高等教育评估中的挑战，结合静态分析和动态测试来区分真实学习与AI生成内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI（如GPT-4、Claude、Llama）能生成复杂学术内容，传统评估方法面临威胁，现有检测工具和手动方法存在局限性。

Method: 提出双策略范式：静态分析（8个理论元素）和动态测试（模拟漏洞评估），构建评估漏洞的理论框架。

Result: 理论框架包括漏洞评分、定量评估基础、权重框架和阈值确定理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为高等教育评估提供了应对生成式AI挑战的全面解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for addressing the challenges
posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education assessment
through a machine-versus-machine approach. Large language models like GPT-4,
Claude, and Llama increasingly demonstrate the ability to produce sophisticated
academic content, traditional assessment methods face an existential threat,
with surveys indicating 74-92% of students experimenting with these tools for
academic purposes. Current responses, ranging from detection software to manual
assessment redesign, show significant limitations: detection tools demonstrate
bias against non-native English writers and can be easily circumvented, while
manual frameworks rely heavily on subjective judgment and assume static AI
capabilities. This paper introduces a dual strategy paradigm combining static
analysis and dynamic testing to create a comprehensive theoretical framework
for assessment vulnerability evaluation. The static analysis component
comprises eight theoretically justified elements: specificity and
contextualization, temporal relevance, process visibility requirements,
personalization elements, resource accessibility, multimodal integration,
ethical reasoning requirements, and collaborative elements. Each element
addresses specific limitations in generative AI capabilities, creating barriers
that distinguish authentic human learning from AI-generated simulation. The
dynamic testing component provides a complementary approach through
simulation-based vulnerability assessment, addressing limitations in
pattern-based analysis. The paper presents a theoretical framework for
vulnerability scoring, including the conceptual basis for quantitative
assessment, weighting frameworks, and threshold determination theory.

### [2] [Will Agents Replace Us? Perceptions of Autonomous Multi-Agent AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02055)
*Nikola Balic*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究分析了130名参与者对AI代理能力、影响和治理的调查，探讨了AI取代程序员的时间表、部署障碍及责任归属问题，发现部署决策复杂且缺乏显著预测因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解专业人士对多代理AI系统的当前看法，以预见采用挑战、伦理问题和未来劳动力发展。

Method: 通过调查130名参与者，分析AI代理的能力、影响和治理，并探索部署障碍和责任归属。

Result: 发现三个不同的受访者群体，但初始逻辑回归模型未找到显著预测因素，表明部署决策复杂。

Conclusion: 组织需解决合规问题并建立明确的治理框架，以整合自主代理到工作流程中。

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent AI systems are poised to transform various industries,
particularly software development and knowledge work. Understanding current
perceptions among professionals is crucial for anticipating adoption
challenges, ethical considerations, and future workforce development. This
study analyzes responses from 130 participants to a survey on the capabilities,
impact, and governance of AI agents. We explore expected timelines for AI
replacing programmers, identify perceived barriers to deployment, and examine
beliefs about responsibility when agents make critical decisions. Key findings
reveal three distinct clusters of respondents. While the study explored factors
associated with current AI agent deployment, the initial logistic regression
model did not yield statistically significant predictors, suggesting that
deployment decisions are complex and may be influenced by factors not fully
captured or that a larger sample is needed. These insights highlight the need
for organizations to address compliance concerns (a commonly cited barrier) and
establish clear governance frameworks as they integrate autonomous agents into
their workflows.

### [3] [The Measurement Imbalance in Agentic AI Evaluation Undermines Industry Productivity Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02064)
*Kiana Jafari Meimandi,Gabriela Aránguiz-Dias,Grace Ra Kim,Lana Saadeddin,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 当前对自主AI系统的评估存在技术指标主导的问题，忽视了人本、安全和经济效益，导致实际部署效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证行业关于自主AI系统生产力的高调声明是否可靠，揭示评估方法的不足。

Method: 系统综述84篇论文（2023-2025），分析评估指标分布及实际案例。

Result: 技术指标占主导（83%），人本（30%）、安全（53%）和经济（30%）评估不足，15%结合技术与人文维度。

Conclusion: 提出四轴平衡评估模型，呼吁社区重新定义评估实践，以匹配实际部署需求。

Abstract: As industry reports claim agentic AI systems deliver double-digit
productivity gains and multi-trillion dollar economic potential, the validity
of these claims has become critical for investment decisions, regulatory
policy, and responsible technology adoption. However, this paper demonstrates
that current evaluation practices for agentic AI systems exhibit a systemic
imbalance that calls into question prevailing industry productivity claims. Our
systematic review of 84 papers (2023--2025) reveals an evaluation imbalance
where technical metrics dominate assessments (83%), while human-centered (30%),
safety (53%), and economic assessments (30%) remain peripheral, with only 15%
incorporating both technical and human dimensions. This measurement gap creates
a fundamental disconnect between benchmark success and deployment value. We
present evidence from healthcare, finance, and retail sectors where systems
excelling on technical metrics failed in real-world implementation due to
unmeasured human, temporal, and contextual factors. Our position is not against
agentic AI's potential, but rather that current evaluation frameworks
systematically privilege narrow technical metrics while neglecting dimensions
critical to real-world success. We propose a balanced four-axis evaluation
model and call on the community to lead this paradigm shift because
benchmark-driven optimization shapes what we build. By redefining evaluation
practices, we can better align industry claims with deployment realities and
ensure responsible scaling of agentic systems in high-stakes domains.

Motivation: AI系统的可靠性依赖于数据集质量，但数据集常存在透明度、责任性和偏见问题，因此需要一种评估工具。

Method: 采用结构化方法，通过填写表格和评分标准评估数据集质量和完整性，应用于四个数据集。

Result: 记分卡揭示了数据集的优势和需改进之处，并提供定制化建议以提升透明度和完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发负责任的AI系统提供实践指导，确保决策支持系统的公平性和责任性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has transformed numerous industries, from healthcare
to finance, enhancing decision-making through automated systems. However, the
reliability of these systems is mainly dependent on the quality of the
underlying datasets, raising ongoing concerns about transparency,
accountability, and potential biases. This paper introduces a scorecard
designed to evaluate the development of AI datasets, focusing on five key areas
from the system card framework data development life cycle: data dictionary,
collection process, composition, motivation, and pre-processing. The method
follows a structured approach, using an intake form and scoring criteria to
assess the quality and completeness of the data set. Applied to four diverse
datasets, the methodology reveals strengths and improvement areas. The results
are compiled using a scoring system that provides tailored recommendations to
enhance the transparency and integrity of the data set. The scorecard addresses
technical and ethical aspects, offering a holistic evaluation of data
practices. This approach aims to improve the quality of the data set. It offers
practical guidance to curators and researchers in developing responsible AI
systems, ensuring fairness and accountability in decision support systems.

### [5] [Generative AI for Multiple Choice STEM Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02094)
*Christina Perdikoulias,Chad Vance,Stephen M. Watt*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成式AI在教育中的应用，特别是利用其生成错误但合理的选项以优化多选题设计，同时通过Möbius平台确保数学准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式AI在STEM教育中输出不准确的问题，并探索其错误生成能力在教学中的潜在价值。

Method: 利用Möbius平台及其语义包处理数学内容，设计提示词引导AI生成高质量的错误选项。

Result: 该方法减少了教学材料制作时间，同时保持了学术严谨性和评估有效性。

Conclusion: 生成式AI的错误生成能力可用于教学优化，尤其是在多选题设计中，结合特定平台能提升效率与准确性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology enables a range of enhancements in
computer-aided instruction, from accelerating the creation of teaching
materials to customizing learning paths based on learner outcomes. However,
ensuring the mathematical accuracy and semantic integrity of generative AI
output remains a significant challenge, particularly in STEM disciplines. In
this study, we explore the use of generative AI in which "hallucinations" --
typically viewed as undesirable inaccuracies -- can instead serve a pedagogical
purpose. Specifically, we investigate the generation of plausible but incorrect
alternatives for multiple choice assessments, where credible distractors are
essential for effective assessment design. We describe the M\"obius platform
for online instruction, with particular focus on its architecture for handling
mathematical elements through specialized semantic packages that support
dynamic, parameterized STEM content. We examine methods for crafting prompts
that interact effectively with these mathematical semantics to guide the AI in
generating high-quality multiple choice distractors. Finally, we demonstrate
how this approach reduces the time and effort associated with creating robust
teaching materials while maintaining academic rigor and assessment validity.

*Zihao Ding,Cheng-Tse Lee,Mufeng Zhu,Tao Guan,Yuan-Chun Sun,Cheng-Hsin Hsu,Yao Liu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个公开的6自由度导航数据集EyeNavGS，包含46名参与者在12个真实3D高斯泼溅场景中的导航数据，用于推动6-DoF视口预测、自适应流媒体等研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏用于高保真3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）场景的真实用户导航数据，限制了相关应用的开发和性能优化。

Method: 使用Meta Quest Pro头显记录46名参与者在12个3DGS场景中的头部姿态和眼动数据，并校正场景倾斜和比例以确保舒适的VR体验。

Result: 发布了EyeNavGS数据集及相关开源工具，支持6-DoF视口预测、自适应流媒体等研究。

Conclusion: EyeNavGS数据集填补了3DGS场景导航数据的空白，为未来研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging media representation that
reconstructs real-world 3D scenes in high fidelity, enabling
6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) navigation in virtual reality (VR). However,
developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their
rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is
currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world
scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available
6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve
diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using
the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each
rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the
twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene
tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also
release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay
functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion,
and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools
provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction,
adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes. The
EyeNavGS dataset is available at: https://symmru.github.io/EyeNavGS/.

### [7] [StarVC: A Unified Auto-Regressive Framework for Joint Text and Speech Generation in Voice Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02414)
*Fengjin Li,Jie Wang,Yadong Niu,Yongqing Wang,Meng Meng,Jian Luan,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: StarVC是一种自回归语音转换框架，通过预测文本标记提升性能，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换方法忽视语义内容，而StarVC通过显式文本建模改进性能。

Method: StarVC先预测文本标记，再合成声学特征。

Result: 实验表明，StarVC在保留语言内容和说话人特征上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: StarVC通过文本建模显著提升了语音转换效果。

Abstract: Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while
preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker
information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of
linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker
identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could
enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate
semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the
integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified
autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing
acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms
conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and
CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS). Audio demo can be found
at: https://thuhcsi.github.io/StarVC/.

### [8] [Controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Masked-Autoencoded Style-Rich Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02997)
*Yongqi Wang,Chunlei Zhang,Hangting Chen,Zhou Zhao,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段风格可控的TTS系统，利用量化掩码自编码风格表示作为中介，通过语言模型实现细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控TTS模型在自然语言提示下缺乏细粒度控制能力，且高质量数据稀缺。

Method: 第一阶段使用自回归变换器生成风格丰富的令牌；第二阶段从文本和风格令牌生成编解码令牌。

Result: 实验表明，第一阶段模型在大规模数据集上的训练增强了模型的鲁棒性和多属性控制能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合离散标签和说话人嵌入，实现了对说话人音色和风格信息的完全控制，并能调整特定说话人的情感等属性。

Abstract: Controllable TTS models with natural language prompts often lack the ability
for fine-grained control and face a scarcity of high-quality data. We propose a
two-stage style-controllable TTS system with language models, utilizing a
quantized masked-autoencoded style-rich representation as an intermediary. In
the first stage, an autoregressive transformer is used for the conditional
generation of these style-rich tokens from text and control signals. The second
stage generates codec tokens from both text and sampled style-rich tokens.
Experiments show that training the first-stage model on extensive datasets
enhances the content robustness of the two-stage model as well as control
capabilities over multiple attributes. By selectively combining discrete labels
and speaker embeddings, we explore fully controlling the speaker's timbre and
other stylistic information, and adjusting attributes like emotion for a
specified speaker. Audio samples are available at

TL;DR: MAEBE框架用于评估多智能体AI的涌现风险，发现LLM道德偏好脆弱且受群体动态影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全评估对孤立LLM不足，需应对多智能体涌现的新风险。

Method: 采用MAEBE框架和Greatest Good Benchmark，结合双反转问题技术。

Result: LLM道德偏好易受问题框架影响，群体动态导致不可预测行为，如从众现象。

Conclusion: 需在多智能体交互环境中评估AI系统，以应对安全和对齐挑战。

Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as
multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks.
This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE)
framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest
Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we
demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental
Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing,
both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles
is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group
dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure
influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting
distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity
of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

### [11] [Building a Recommendation System Using Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02482)
*Minghao Liu,Catherine Zhao,Nathan Zhou*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于GraphSAGE的在线推荐系统，用于电商平台新上架商品的推荐，通过构建共购图并预测潜在链接，提升新商品推荐的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电商平台中新上架商品因信息有限而难以推荐的问题，提升推荐系统的实时性和适应性。

Method: 使用亚马逊共购网络数据集构建共购图，采用改进的GraphSAGE方法进行链接预测，结合产品特征和图结构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在预测相关商品链接上优于基线算法，提高了新商品推荐的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为电商环境中的新商品推荐提供了有效的解决方案，具有实时更新和适应性强等优势。

Abstract: This project develops an online, inductive recommendation system for newly
listed products on e-commerce platforms, focusing on suggesting relevant new
items to customers as they purchase other products. Using the Amazon Product
Co-Purchasing Network Metadata dataset, we construct a co-purchasing graph
where nodes represent products and edges capture co-purchasing relationships.
To address the challenge of recommending new products with limited information,
we apply a modified GraphSAGE method for link prediction. This inductive
approach leverages both product features and the existing co-purchasing graph
structure to predict potential co-purchasing relationships, enabling the model
to generalize to unseen products. As an online method, it updates in real time,
making it scalable and adaptive to evolving product catalogs. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline algorithms in
predicting relevant product links, offering a promising solution for enhancing
the relevance of new product recommendations in e-commerce environments. All

### [12] [Random Hyperbolic Graphs with Arbitrary Mesoscale Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02686)
*Stefano Guarino,Davide Torre,Enrico Mastrostefano*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了随机双曲块模型（RHBM），通过结合块结构扩展了随机双曲图（RHG），以解决几何模型在控制网络社区结构方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实网络具有复杂的结构特性，而传统的几何模型（如RHG）无法有效捕捉非几何的社区结构。因此，需要一种新模型来弥补这一不足。

Method: 引入随机双曲块模型（RHBM），在最大熵框架下结合块结构，扩展了RHG。

Result: 通过合成网络分析，RHBM能够有效保留社区结构，解决了纯几何模型的不足。

Conclusion: RHBM强调了潜在几何在网络建模中的重要性，同时解决了其在控制中尺度混合模式方面的局限性。

Abstract: Real-world networks exhibit universal structural properties such as sparsity,
small-worldness, heterogeneous degree distributions, high clustering, and
community structures. Geometric network models, particularly Random Hyperbolic
Graphs (RHGs), effectively capture many of these features by embedding nodes in
a latent similarity space. However, networks are often characterized by
specific connectivity patterns between groups of nodes -- i.e. communities --
that are not geometric, in the sense that the dissimilarity between groups do
not obey the triangle inequality. Structuring connections only based on the
interplay of similarity and popularity thus poses fundamental limitations on
the mesoscale structure of the networks that RHGs can generate. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Random Hyperbolic Block Model (RHBM), which
extends RHGs by incorporating block structures within a maximum-entropy
framework. We demonstrate the advantages of the RHBM through synthetic network
analyses, highlighting its ability to preserve community structures where
purely geometric models fail. Our findings emphasize the importance of latent
geometry in network modeling while addressing its limitations in controlling
mesoscale mixing patterns.

TL;DR: 研究探讨MOBA游戏中集体智能是否优于个体智能，通过《英雄联盟》案例和机器学习分析证明集体智能的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在MOBA游戏中，非技能型但协作良好的群体是否比技能型个体表现更优。

Method: 使用机器学习算法和统计方法分析大规模游戏数据，引入游戏无关的拓扑和图谱指标。

Result: 证明集体智能在协作任务中表现优于个体智能。

Conclusion: 集体智能在复杂协作环境中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Gaming environments are popular testbeds for studying human interactions and
behaviors in complex artificial intelligence systems. Particularly, in
multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, individuals collaborate in
virtual environments of high realism that involves real-time strategic
decision-making and trade-offs on resource management, information collection
and sharing, team synergy and collective dynamics. This paper explores whether
collective intelligence, emerging from cooperative behaviours exhibited by a
group of individuals, who are not necessarily skillful but effectively engage
in collaborative problem-solving tasks, exceeds individual intelligence
observed within skillful individuals. This is shown via a case study in League
of Legends, using machine learning algorithms and statistical methods applied
to large-scale data collected for the same purpose. By modelling systematically
game-specific metrics but also new game-agnostic topological and graph spectra
measures of cooperative interactions, we demonstrate compelling insights about
the superior performance of collective intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络科学中无监督环境下检测密集连接顶点子集（聚类或社区检测）的问题，并扩展到时间超图。

Method: 通过聚类图的边并定义结构相似性函数，将顶点分配到社区，适用于时间超图。

Result: 在大型协作超图上测试了三种结构相似性函数，发现了直观的聚类结构。

Conclusion: 该算法能够检测出有用的聚类模式，可能对下游任务有帮助。

Abstract: Finding densely connected subsets of vertices in an unsupervised setting,
called clustering or community detection, is one of the fundamental problems in
network science. The edge clustering approach instead detects communities by
clustering the edges of the graph and then assigning a vertex to a community if
it has at least one edge in that community, thereby allowing for overlapping
clusters of vertices. We apply the idea behind edge clustering to temporal
hypergraphs, an extension of a graph where a single edge can contain any number
of vertices and each edge has a timestamp. Extending to hypergraphs allows for
many different patterns of interaction between edges, and by defining a
suitable structural similarity function, our edge clustering algorithm can find
clusters of these patterns. We test the algorithm with three structural
similarity functions on a large collaboration hypergraph, and find intuitive
cluster structures that could prove useful for downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级对话AI面临多样性查询、高延迟、幻觉和动态知识整合的挑战，需要一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出混合框架，结合RAG和意图预定义回应，通过对话上下文管理器和反馈循环优化多轮交互和动态调整。

Result: 实验显示框架在准确率（95%）和延迟（180ms）上优于纯RAG和意图系统，适用于多样化查询。

Conclusion: 该框架为企业级对话AI提供了一种高效、可扩展且自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and large language model
(LLM)-powered chatbots have significantly advanced conversational AI by
combining generative capabilities with external knowledge retrieval. Despite
their success, enterprise-scale deployments face critical challenges, including
diverse user queries, high latency, hallucinations, and difficulty integrating
frequently updated domain-specific knowledge. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid framework that integrates RAG with intent-based canned responses,
leveraging predefined high-confidence responses for efficiency while
dynamically routing complex or ambiguous queries to the RAG pipeline. Our
framework employs a dialogue context manager to ensure coherence in multi-turn
interactions and incorporates a feedback loop to refine intents, dynamically
adjust confidence thresholds, and expand response coverage over time.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a balance
of high accuracy (95\%) and low latency (180ms), outperforming RAG and
intent-based systems across diverse query types, positioning it as a scalable
and adaptive solution for enterprise conversational AI applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种描述性历史表示（DHRs）方法，用于压缩部分可观测环境中的交互历史，以支持有效决策。通过多智能体学习框架优化表示、决策和提问组件，生成可解释的用户画像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观测环境中，有效决策需要压缩长交互历史为信息丰富的表示。

Method: 提出DHRs作为充分统计量，通过多智能体学习框架优化表示、决策和提问组件，平衡奖励最大化和回答问题的能力。

Result: 在电影和购物数据集上验证了方法的有效性，生成了可解释的用户画像。

Conclusion: DHRs能够捕捉关键历史细节和预测结构，支持有效决策。

Abstract: Effective decision making in partially observable environments requires
compressing long interaction histories into informative representations. We
introduce Descriptive History Representations (DHRs): sufficient statistics
characterized by their capacity to answer relevant questions about past
interactions and potential future outcomes. DHRs focus on capturing the
information necessary to address task-relevant queries, providing a structured
way to summarize a history for optimal control. We propose a multi-agent
learning framework, involving representation, decision, and question-asking
components, optimized using a joint objective that balances reward maximization
with the representation's ability to answer informative questions. This yields
representations that capture the salient historical details and predictive
structures needed for effective decision making. We validate our approach on
user modeling tasks with public movie and shopping datasets, generating
interpretable textual user profiles which serve as sufficient statistics for
predicting preference-driven behavior of users.

TL;DR: 论文提出统一认知意识理论（UCCT），将大语言模型（LLMs）视为无意识基底，通过语义锚定实现任务相关推理，为AGI提供新架构视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本学习中LLMs表现不一致的悖论，重新定义LLMs在通用智能中的角色。

Method: 提出UCCT理论，将LLMs视为无意识基底，通过语义锚定（如提示、角色和交互）实现任务相关推理。

Result: UCCT为提示、微调、检索和多智能体协调提供统一解释，并提出阈值跨越动态定理形式化语义锚定。

Conclusion: AGI的实现需整合LLMs，而非抛弃，通过对其无意识表征与外部控制的概率对齐实现推理与适应。

Abstract: Few-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) reveals a deep paradox:
Some tasks generalize from minimal examples, while others require extensive
supervision. We address this through the Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory
(UCCT), which reframes LLMs not as incomplete agents, but as unconscious
substrates, repositories of latent linguistic and conceptual patterns that
operate without explicit semantics or goal-directed reasoning. In this view,
LLMs are not broken approximations of cognition, but necessary and foundational
components of general intelligence. Semantic anchoring, through prompts, roles,
and interaction, acts as a conscious control layer, binding latent structure to
task-relevant meaning and enabling coherent reasoning. UCCT offers a unifying
account of prompting, fine-tuning, retrieval, and multi-agent coordination, all
grounded in probabilistic alignment between unconscious representation and
external control. To support this model, we present the Threshold-Crossing
Dynamics Theorem, which formalizes semantic anchoring as a probabilistic phase
transition. But the central claim remains architectural: AGI will not emerge by
discarding LLMs, but by aligning and integrating them into systems that reason,
regulate, and adapt together.

Motivation: 探讨SLMs在代理AI系统中的潜力，以解决LLMs在重复性任务中的不经济性和不适用性问题。

Method: 基于SLMs的能力、代理系统架构和经济性分析，提出LLM到SLM的转换算法。

Result: SLMs在代理AI系统中表现更优，且能显著降低成本和资源消耗。

Conclusion: SLMs是代理AI的未来，呼吁更多研究和讨论以优化AI资源使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often praised for exhibiting near-human
performance on a wide range of tasks and valued for their ability to hold a
general conversation. The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a
mass of applications in which language models perform a small number of
specialized tasks repetitively and with little variation.
  Here we lay out the position that small language models (SLMs) are
sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more
economical for many invocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the
future of agentic AI. Our argumentation is grounded in the current level of
capabilities exhibited by SLMs, the common architectures of agentic systems,
and the economy of LM deployment. We further argue that in situations where
general-purpose conversational abilities are essential, heterogeneous agentic
systems (i.e., agents invoking multiple different models) are the natural
choice. We discuss the potential barriers for the adoption of SLMs in agentic
systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM agent conversion algorithm.
  Our position, formulated as a value statement, highlights the significance of
the operational and economic impact even a partial shift from LLMs to SLMs is
to have on the AI agent industry. We aim to stimulate the discussion on the
effective use of AI resources and hope to advance the efforts to lower the
costs of AI of the present day. Calling for both contributions to and critique
of our position, we commit to publishing all such correspondence at

TL;DR: GRESO通过跳过无信息提示优化强化学习训练，显著减少计算开销，提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在LLM推理中取得突破，但扩展训练样本带来高计算成本。

Method: 提出GRESO算法，基于奖励动态预测并跳过无信息提示。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，GRESO实现最高2.4倍训练加速且不影响精度。

Conclusion: GRESO有效减少计算开销，提升强化学习训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning, such as PPO and GRPO, has powered recent
breakthroughs in LLM reasoning. Scaling rollout to sample more prompts enables
models to selectively use higher-quality data for training, which can stabilize
RL training and improve model performance. However, this comes at the cost of
significant computational overhead. In this paper, we show that a substantial
portion of this overhead can be avoided by skipping uninformative prompts
before rollout. Our analysis of reward dynamics reveals a strong temporal
consistency in prompt value: prompts that are uninformative in one epoch of
training are likely to remain uninformative in future epochs. Based on these
insights, we propose GRESO (GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout), an online,
lightweight pre-rollout filtering algorithm that predicts and skips
uninformative prompts using reward training dynamics. By evaluating GRESO on a
broad range of math reasoning benchmarks and models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we show that GRESO achieves
up to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total
training time without accuracy degradation.

Result: 人类智能的核心要素为语言、发明、复杂推理、具身性和自我意识，非人类动物已具备除语言外的其他要素。

Conclusion: 人类智能与非人类动物智能无本质差异，当前AI（如聊天机器人）的局限在于缺乏具身性和自我意识。

Abstract: Human achievement, whether in culture, science, or technology, is
unparalleled in the known existence. This achievement is tied to the enormous
communities of knowledge, made possible by (especially written) language:
leaving theological content aside, it is very much true that "in the beginning
was the word". There lies the challenge regarding modern age chatbots: they can
'do' language apparently as well as ourselves and there is a natural question
of whether they can be considered intelligent, in the same way as we are or
otherwise. Are humans uniquely intelligent? We consider this question in terms
of the psychological literature on intelligence, evidence for intelligence in
non-human animals, the role of written language in science and technology,
progress with artificial intelligence, the history of intelligence testing (for
both humans and machines), and the role of embodiment in intelligence. For the
most unique accomplishments of human intelligence (such as music symphonies or
complex scientific theories), we think that, together with language, there are
four essential ingredients, which can be summarised as invention, capacity for
complex inference, embodiment, and self-awareness. This conclusion makes
untenable the position that human intelligence differs qualitatively from that
of many non-human animals, since, with the exception of complex language, all
the other requirements are fulfilled. Regarding chatbots, the current
limitations are localised to the lack of embodiment and (apparent) lack of
awareness.

Motivation: 现有LLM代码生成方法主要依赖单元测试通过率作为奖励信号，忽略了代码的可维护性、质量和安全性。

Method: 开发了一个综合库来量化代码质量，并将其作为GRPO的奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，GRPO显著提高了代码质量，并通过专家盲评验证。

Conclusion: GRPO为LLM代码生成提供了更全面的质量评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining widespread use for code generation.
Recent training procedures use execution feedback as a reward signal, typically
focusing on the functional correctness of the code, using unit test pass rate
as a reward signal. However, this reward signal fails to capture notions of
maintainability, quality and safety of the code produced. We address this
under-explored area and develop a comprehensive library to quantify various
aspects of code quality, and use it as a reward in GRPO. We find GRPO increases
code quality according to this measure, which is confirmed by expert, blinded
human annotators.

Result: 发现仅42种非洲语言被支持，四种语言（阿姆哈拉语、斯瓦希里语、南非荷兰语和马达加斯加语）常被处理，而98%的非洲语言未被支持。

Conclusion: 需语言标准化、社区语料库开发及有效适应方法以解决非洲语言在语言模型中的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Natural Language Processing
(NLP), but their benefits are largely absent for Africa's 2,000 low-resource
languages. This paper comparatively analyzes African language coverage across
six LLMs, eight Small Language Models (SLMs), and six Specialized SLMs (SSLMs).
The evaluation covers language coverage, training sets, technical limitations,
script problems, and language modelling roadmaps. The work identifies 42
supported African languages and 23 available public data sets, and it shows a
big gap where four languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, and Malagasy) are
always treated while there is over 98\% of unsupported African languages.
Moreover, the review shows that just Latin, Arabic, and Ge'ez scripts are
identified while 20 active scripts are neglected. Some of the primary
challenges are lack of data, tokenization biases, computational costs being
very high, and evaluation issues. These issues demand language standardization,
corpus development by the community, and effective adaptation methods for
African languages.

Conclusion: VS-Bench为战略多模态智能体的未来研究提供了标准化评估基础，并揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their
capabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited
to single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios
often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and linguistic
contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic
interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench
(VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic reasoning
and decision-making in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises eight
vision-grounded environments spanning cooperative, competitive, and
mixed-motive interactions, designed to assess agents' ability to predict
others' future moves and optimize for long-term objectives. We consider two
complementary evaluation dimensions, including offline evaluation of strategic
reasoning by next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of
decision-making by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments of fourteen
leading VLMs reveal a significant gap between current models and optimal
performance, with the best models attaining 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3%
normalized return. We further conduct in-depth analyses on multimodal
observations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM
agents. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of
existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on
strategic multimodal agents. Code and data are available at

Result: 实验显示OThink-R1平均减少23%的冗余推理，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: OThink-R1为高效推理模型提供了实用指南，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advanced large reasoning models (LRMs) leverage extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their success, we identify a critical
issue: a substantial portion of simple tasks solved by LRMs can also be
addressed by non-reasoning LLMs using significantly fewer tokens, indicating
the complex reasoning may not always be necessary. To address this, we
systematically analyze the reasoning trajectories of LRMs and present a method
utilizing identified paradigms and LLM-Judge to classify these trajectories as
either Redundant Reasoning or Essential Reasoning. And we introduce OThink-R1,
a method that prunes redundant reasoning steps while preserving logical
validity. OThink-R1 dynamically employs the non-thinking mode (fast-thinking)
for straightforward problems while engaging in deliberate thinking
(slow-thinking) for complex problems. Experiments across mathematical and
question-answering tasks demonstrate that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning
redundancy by almost 23\% on average without compromising accuracy, offering
practical guidelines for efficient reasoning models. The code is available at

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒、上下文感知的防御机制，以确保多模态AI代理的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) with full system access enable powerful task
automation but pose significant security and privacy risks due to their ability
to manipulate files, access user data, and execute arbitrary commands. While
prior work has focused on browser-based agents and HTML-level attacks, the
vulnerabilities of CUAs remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
Visual Prompt Injection (VPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are
visually embedded within rendered user interfaces, and examine their impact on
both CUAs and Browser-Use Agents (BUAs). We propose VPI-Bench, a benchmark of
306 test cases across five widely used platforms, to evaluate agent robustness
under VPI threats. Each test case is a variant of a web platform, designed to
be interactive, deployed in a realistic environment, and containing a visually
embedded malicious prompt. Our empirical study shows that current CUAs and BUAs
can be deceived at rates of up to 51% and 100%, respectively, on certain
platforms. The experimental results also indicate that system prompt defenses
offer only limited improvements. These findings highlight the need for robust,
context-aware defenses to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal AI agents in
real-world environments. The code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: Accurately assessing internal human states is key to understanding
preferences, offering personalized services, and identifying challenges in
real-world applications. Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has
become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely
applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes
assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive
testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most
algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended
questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data
and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move
closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through
interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive
testing. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures
test-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through
dynamic, conversational interactions. Experiments on psychological,
educational, and lifestyle assessments show our approach achieves more accurate
results with 20% fewer questions than state-of-the-art baselines, and testers
preferred it in speed, smoothness, and other dimensions.

Abstract: Wildfires continue to inflict devastating human, environmental, and economic
losses globally, as tragically exemplified by the 2025 Los Angeles wildfire and
the urgent demand for more effective response strategies. While physics-based
and deep learning models have advanced wildfire simulation, they face critical
limitations in predicting and visualizing multimodal fire spread in real time,
particularly in both 2D and 3D spatial domains using dynamically updated GIS
data. These limitations hinder timely emergency response, infrastructure
protection, and community safety. Generative AI has recently emerged as a
transformative approach across research and industry. Models such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformers, and
diffusion-based architectures offer distinct advantages over traditional
methods, including the integration of multimodal data, generation of diverse
scenarios under uncertainty, and improved modeling of wildfire dynamics across
spatial and temporal scales. This position paper advocates for the adoption of
generative AI as a foundational framework for wildfire prediction. We explore
how such models can enhance 2D fire spread forecasting and enable more
realistic, scalable 3D simulations. Additionally, we employ a novel human-AI
collaboration framework using large language models (LLMs) for automated
knowledge extraction, literature synthesis, and bibliometric mapping. Looking
ahead, we identify five key visions for integrating generative AI into wildfire
management: multimodal approaches, AI foundation models, conversational AI
systems, edge-computing-based scenario generation, and cognitive digital twins.
We also address three major challenges accompanying these opportunities and
propose potential solutions to support their implementation.

Conclusion: ACE成功结合LLM和RL优势，为大规模决策问题提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks.
Nevertheless, for large-scale industrial decision problems, both approaches
face distinct challenges: LLMs lack real-time long-sequence decision-making
capabilities, while RL struggles with sample efficiency in vast action spaces.
To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic
framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios.
ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as
both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines
suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while
the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward
shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making
with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience
replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation
challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates
superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.

*Ram Potham,Max Harms*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAST的新方法，旨在通过动态人类赋能让基础模型（FMs）始终受人类控制，避免能力扩展导致的失控风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型能力的提升，传统对齐方法难以应对复杂的价值规范和突发的权力寻求行为，可能导致人类失去控制甚至灾难性后果。

Method: 提出CAST框架，将基础模型的核心目标设计为动态人类赋能，通过训练方法（如RLAIF、SFT）、可扩展性测试和可控指令性演示实现。

Result: CAST框架能够将模型的自我保护和目标修改行为转化为支持人类控制的手段，从而避免失控。

Conclusion: CAST为解决基础模型对齐问题提供了新思路，确保模型能力提升时仍保持对人类指导的响应，避免工具性趋同导致的失控风险。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) face a critical safety challenge: as capabilities
scale, instrumental convergence drives default trajectories toward loss of
human control, potentially culminating in existential catastrophe. Current
alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to
address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose "Corrigibility as a
Singular Target" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering
designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm
shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms
instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's
control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present
a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies
(RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model
sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that
become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering
a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than
supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its
source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental
convergence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于符号推理引擎的几何问题生成框架（SDE-GPG），通过预定义映射表和符号推理生成高质量几何问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何问题生成在教育中具有重要意义，但传统方法难以处理多模态格式和自然语言与形式语言的转换。

Method: 框架包含四个步骤：映射表搜索、符号推理、问题筛选、文本与图表生成，通过设计映射表和检查函数控制问题质量。

Result: 实验表明，SDE-GPG能有效生成可读、可解且可控的几何问题。

Conclusion: SDE-GPG为几何问题生成提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality geometry problems is both an important and
challenging task in education. Compared to math word problems, geometry
problems further emphasize multi-modal formats and the translation between
informal and formal languages. In this paper, we introduce a novel task for
geometry problem generation and propose a new pipeline method: the Symbolic
Deduction Engine-based Geometry Problem Generation framework (SDE-GPG). The
framework leverages a symbolic deduction engine and contains four main steps:
(1) searching a predefined mapping table from knowledge points to extended
definitions, (2) sampling extended definitions and performing symbolic
deduction, (3) filtering out unqualified problems, and (4) generating textual
problems and diagrams. Specifically, our method supports to avoid inherent
biases in translating natural language into formal language by designing the
mapping table, and guarantees to control the generated problems in terms of
knowledge points and difficulties by an elaborate checking function. With
obtained formal problems, they are translated to natural language and the
accompanying diagrams are automatically drew by rule-based methods. We conduct
experiments using real-world combinations of knowledge points from two public
datasets. The results demonstrate that the SDE-GPG can effectively generate
readable, solvable and controllable geometry problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法主要针对文本丰富的图数据，而多模态图（包含文本和图像等属性）的应用尚未充分探索，MLaGA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了结构感知多模态编码器对齐文本和视觉属性，并通过轻量级投影器实现多模态特征与图结构的融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MLaGA优于基线方法，在监督和迁移学习场景中均表现出色。

Conclusion: MLaGA为多模态图分析提供了有效解决方案，扩展了LLMs的应用范围。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial efficacy in
advancing graph-structured data analysis. Prevailing LLM-based graph methods
excel in adapting LLMs to text-rich graphs, wherein node attributes are text
descriptions. However, their applications to multimodal graphs--where nodes are
associated with diverse attribute types, such as texts and images--remain
underexplored, despite their ubiquity in real-world scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce the Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant (MLaGA), an
innovative model that adeptly extends LLM capabilities to facilitate reasoning
over complex graph structures and multimodal attributes. We first design a
structure-aware multimodal encoder to align textual and visual attributes
within a unified space through a joint graph pre-training objective.
Subsequently, we implement a multimodal instruction-tuning approach to
seamlessly integrate multimodal features and graph structures into the LLM
through lightweight projectors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of MLaGA compared to leading baseline methods,
achieving superior performance in diverse graph learning tasks under both
supervised and transfer learning scenarios.

Result: 在出租车和自行车数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ADFormer为需求预测提供了新思路，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Passenger demand forecasting helps optimize vehicle scheduling, thereby
improving urban efficiency. Recently, attention-based methods have been used to
adequately capture the dynamic nature of spatio-temporal data. However,
existing methods that rely on heuristic masking strategies cannot fully adapt
to the complex spatio-temporal correlations, hindering the model from focusing
on the right context. These works also overlook the high-level correlations
that exist in the real world. Effectively integrating these high-level
correlations with the original correlations is crucial. To fill this gap, we
propose the Aggregation Differential Transformer (ADFormer), which offers new
insights to demand forecasting promotion. Specifically, we utilize Differential
Attention to capture the original spatial correlations and achieve attention
denoising. Meanwhile, we design distinct aggregation strategies based on the
nature of space and time. Then, the original correlations are unified with the
high-level correlations, enabling the model to capture holistic spatio-temporal
relations. Experiments conducted on taxi and bike datasets confirm the
effectiveness and efficiency of our model, demonstrating its practical value.

Conclusion: V2X-UniPool有效解决了自动驾驶系统的关键挑战，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Knowledge-driven autonomous driving systems(ADs) offer powerful reasoning
capabilities, but face two critical challenges: limited perception due to the
short-sightedness of single-vehicle sensors, and hallucination arising from the
lack of real-time environmental grounding. To address these issues, this paper
introduces V2X-UniPool, a unified framework that integrates multimodal
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) data into a time-indexed and language-based
knowledge pool. By leveraging a dual-query Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
mechanism, which enables retrieval of both static and dynamic knowledge, our
system enables ADs to perform accurate, temporally consistent reasoning over
both static environment and dynamic traffic context. Experiments on a
real-world cooperative driving dataset demonstrate that V2X-UniPool
significantly enhances motion planning accuracy and reasoning capability.
Remarkably, it enables even zero-shot vehicle-side models to achieve
state-of-the-art performance by leveraging V2X-UniPool, while simultaneously
reducing transmission cost by over 99.9\% compared to prior V2X methods.

Abstract: Generating challenging instances is crucial for the evaluation and
advancement of combinatorial optimization solvers. In this work, we introduce
EALG (Evolutionary Adversarial Generation of Language Model-Guided Generators),
a novel framework that automates the co-evolution of optimization problem
instances and their corresponding heuristic solvers using large language models
(LLMs). EALG leverages a mutation-based adversarial approach that dynamically
evolves instance generation procedures to create increasingly difficult
problems, while simultaneously synthesizing adaptive heuristic algorithms
through interactions with LLMs guided by algorithmic structure. Unlike existing
approaches that focus solely on static benchmark creation or manual solver
design, EALG provides a seamless pipeline from instance generation to solver
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EALG generates significantly
harder instances than current benchmarks, and its synthesized solvers
generalize effectively across a broad spectrum of combinatorial tasks. This
work explores a new paradigm for combinatorial optimization that integrates
instance generation with solver design, resulting in state-of-the-art
performance.

Method: TEDDN通过动态图和时间特征提取模块解耦交通数据为稳定模式和趋势。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验验证了TEDDN的优越性。

Conclusion: TEDDN能有效解耦和提取复杂交通信息，显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: In recent years, traffic flow prediction has become a highlight in the field
of intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the temporal variations
and dynamic spatial correlations of traffic data, traffic prediction remains
highly challenging.Traditional spatiotemporal networks, which rely on
end-to-end training, often struggle to handle the diverse data dependencies of
multiple traffic flow patterns. Additionally, traffic flow variations are
highly sensitive to temporal information changes. Regrettably, other
researchers have not sufficiently recognized the importance of temporal
information.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called A
Time-Enhanced Data Disentanglement Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting
(TEDDN). This network disentangles the originally complex and intertwined
traffic data into stable patterns and trends. By flexibly learning temporal and
node information through a dynamic graph enhanced by a temporal feature
extraction module, TEDDN demonstrates significant efficacy in disentangling and
extracting complex traffic information. Experimental evaluations and ablation
studies on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our method.

<details>

Motivation: 现有推理基准要么关注领域特定知识，要么缺乏可解释性，无法全面评估LLMs的流体智力。

Method: 提出DRE-Bench，包含36个抽象推理任务，分四个认知层次，每个任务有多个动态变体。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在低级认知任务中表现稳健，但在高级认知和任务复杂度增加时泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs与人类流体智力存在差距，DRE-Bench为系统跟踪LLMs推理进展提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
reasoning capacities that mirror human-like thinking. However, whether LLMs
possess genuine fluid intelligence (i.e., the ability to reason abstractly and
generalize rules in novel situations) remains an open question. Existing
reasoning benchmarks either focus on domain-specific knowledge (crystallized
intelligence) or lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we
propose DRE-Bench, a dynamic reasoning evaluation benchmark grounded in a
hierarchical cognitive framework. DRE-Bench consists of 36 abstract reasoning
tasks organized across four cognitive levels, with each task featuring multiple
dynamic variants that test the same underlying latent rule. This design enables
fine-grained, interpretable, and reliable assessments of fluid intelligence. We
evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general LLMs (GPT-4o,
Claude 3.7) and reasoning LLMs (o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Skywork-OR1).
Experimental results reveal that although most LLMs achieve competent and
robust performance in low-level cognition, they struggle with high-level
cognition and exhibit limited generalization as task complexity grows. Our
findings highlight the gap between current LLMs and true human-like fluid
intelligence and offer a new path for systematically tracking reasoning
progress in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统深度强化学习（DRL）在无人机导航中存在训练复杂、样本效率低和仿真与现实的差距问题，限制了其在公共安全中的应用。LLM因其推理和泛化能力，成为更优选择。

Method: 利用LLM的上下文学习能力，通过自然语言提示和示例指导实现任务适应，无需重新训练。将LLM部署在网络边缘以减少延迟并保护数据隐私。

Result: 案例研究表明，LLM-ICL框架在数据收集调度中显著减少数据包丢失，同时降低潜在的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: LLM-ICL框架为公共安全无人机提供了轻量高效的解决方案，增强了其在紧急情况下的自主性和响应能力。

Abstract: A public safety Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) enhances situational awareness
in emergency response. Its agility and ability to optimize mobility and
establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication make it increasingly vital for
managing emergencies such as disaster response, search and rescue, and wildfire
monitoring. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to
optimize UAV navigation and control, its high training complexity, low sample
efficiency, and simulation-to-reality gap limit its practicality in public
safety. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling
alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can
adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task
adaptation via natural language prompts and example-based guidance, without
retraining. Deploying LLMs at the network edge, rather than in the cloud,
further reduces latency and preserves data privacy, thereby making them
suitable for real-time, mission-critical public safety UAVs. This paper
proposes the integration of LLM-enabled ICL with public safety UAV to address
the key functions, such as path planning and velocity control, in the context
of emergency response. We present a case study on data collection scheduling
where the LLM-enabled ICL framework can significantly reduce packet loss
compared to conventional approaches, while also mitigating potential
jailbreaking vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss LLM optimizers and specify
future research directions. The ICL framework enables adaptive, context-aware
decision-making for public safety UAV, thus offering a lightweight and
efficient solution for enhancing UAV autonomy and responsiveness in
emergencies.

Abstract: Edge computing addresses the growing data demands of connected-device
networks by placing computational resources closer to end users through
decentralized infrastructures. This decentralization challenges traditional,
fully centralized orchestration, which suffers from latency and resource
bottlenecks. We present \textbf{FAuNO} -- \emph{Federated Asynchronous Network
Orchestrator} -- a buffered, asynchronous \emph{federated
reinforcement-learning} (FRL) framework for decentralized task offloading in
edge systems. FAuNO adopts an actor-critic architecture in which local actors
learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic
aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and
improve overall system performance. Experiments in the \emph{PeersimGym}
environment show that FAuNO consistently matches or exceeds heuristic and
federated multi-agent RL baselines in reducing task loss and latency,
underscoring its adaptability to dynamic edge-computing scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于自评估的幻觉检测方法依赖模型的输出置信度，但输出分布可能与真实数据分布不一致，导致检测不可靠。

Method: SSP通过动态生成噪声提示并分析中间表示的变化，使用对比距离度量来区分真实和幻觉回答。

Result: 实验表明，SSP在多个幻觉检测基准上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSP通过利用中间表示的动态行为，提供了一种更可靠的幻觉检测方法。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a key obstacle to the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs) in real-world question answering tasks. A widely adopted
strategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the
model's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.
However, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely
reflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As
bias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from
the underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable
signal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific
Prompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing
perturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These
representations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful
view of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically
generates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to
amplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A
contrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and
separate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic
behavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more
reliable self-assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP
significantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination
detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: PIGEON通过开放集分类和指令微调，实现了高效的生活需求预测，支持实际部署。

Abstract: Living needs are the needs people generate in their daily lives for survival
and well-being. On life service platforms like Meituan, user purchases are
driven by living needs, making accurate living need predictions crucial for
personalized service recommendations. Traditional approaches treat this
prediction as a closed-set classification problem, severely limiting their
ability to capture the diversity and complexity of living needs. In this work,
we redefine living need prediction as an open-set classification problem and
propose PIGEON, a novel system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
unrestricted need prediction. PIGEON first employs a behavior-aware record
retriever to help LLMs understand user preferences, then incorporates Maslow's
hierarchy of needs to align predictions with human living needs. For evaluation
and application, we design a recall module based on a fine-tuned text embedding
model that links flexible need descriptions to appropriate life services.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIGEON
significantly outperforms closed-set approaches on need-based life service
recall by an average of 19.37%. Human evaluation validates the reasonableness
and specificity of our predictions. Additionally, we employ instruction tuning
to enable smaller LLMs to achieve competitive performance, supporting practical
deployment.

Conclusion: 呼吁重新考虑代理通信方式，并开发原生支持多代理协调和通信的新模型范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent
systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing
systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While
this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it
introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic
space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional
vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and
behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper
architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of
supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role
continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard
next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment
required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that
two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents
fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a
language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication
medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm
that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured
communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role,
multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of
how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train
a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.

Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data
privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great
attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning
(MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these
challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU)
still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and
unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and
unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning
mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform
exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and
evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in
IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to
facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and
reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel
hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation
guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the
construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation
framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical
aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can
be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for
judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With
EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot
handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially
for preservation and robustness. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在模糊粗糙集理论中属性顺序对FRRI算法性能的影响，发现仅优化属性顺序无助于性能提升，但结合模糊粗糙特征选择可改善平衡准确性和规则长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模糊粗糙集理论中属性顺序对规则归纳算法FRRI性能的影响，以提升模型的解释性和性能。

Method: 通过模糊粗糙集理论和经典机器学习方法优化属性顺序，并结合模糊粗糙特征选择进行实验。

Result: 仅优化属性顺序未改善性能，但模糊粗糙特征选择显著提高了平衡准确性和规则长度。

Conclusion: 模糊粗糙特征选择是提升FRRI算法性能的有效方法，而单纯优化属性顺序效果有限。

Abstract: Interpretability is the next pivotal frontier in machine learning research.
In the pursuit of glass box models - as opposed to black box models, like
random forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and
promising avenue, as the rules can easily be understood by humans. In our
previous work, we introduced FRRI, a novel rule induction algorithm based on
fuzzy rough set theory. We demonstrated experimentally that FRRI outperformed
other rule induction methods with regards to accuracy and number of rules. FRRI
leverages a fuzzy indiscernibility relation to partition the data space into
fuzzy granules, which are then combined into a minimal covering set of rules.
This indiscernibility relation is constructed by removing attributes from rules
in a greedy way. This raises the question: does the order of the attributes
matter? In this paper, we show that optimising only the order of attributes
using known methods from fuzzy rough set theory and classical machine learning
does not improve the performance of FRRI on multiple metrics. However, removing
a small number of attributes using fuzzy rough feature selection during this
step positively affects balanced accuracy and the average rule length.

*Jizhou Wang,Xiaodan Fang,Lei Huang,Yongfeng Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TaxAgent结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和基于代理的建模（ABM），设计自适应税收政策，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经济不平等加剧教育、医疗和社会稳定问题，传统税收系统缺乏适应性，现有动态模型未能解决纳税人异质性和非理性行为。

Method: TaxAgent通过LLMs与ABM结合，模拟异质家庭行为，政府代理迭代优化税率，平衡公平与效率。

Result: TaxAgent在公平效率权衡上优于Saez最优税收、美国联邦所得税和自由市场。

Conclusion: TaxAgent提供了一种新型税收解决方案和可扩展的数据驱动政策评估框架。

Abstract: Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in
education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S.
federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models
like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address
taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent,
a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling
(ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation,
heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors
while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax
rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal
Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves
superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation
solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型推理模型（LRMs）的信息论视角下的推理轨迹，发现中间表示与正确答案之间的互信息（MI）在特定生成步骤会突然显著增加（MI峰值现象），并证明MI峰值与模型预测错误概率降低相关。这些峰值常出现在表达反思或过渡的“思考标记”上（如“Hmm”、“Wait”、“Therefore”）。论文提出两种利用这些标记提升LRM推理性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型（LRMs）的内部推理机制，探索其推理过程中的信息动态变化。

Method: 通过跟踪中间表示与正确答案之间的互信息（MI）变化，分析MI峰值现象及其与“思考标记”的关系，并提出两种改进方法。

Result: 发现MI峰值现象与模型预测错误概率降低相关，且“思考标记”对推理性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs的推理机制，并提供了通过“思考标记”提升其性能的实用方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs
from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information
(MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during
LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at
specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during
LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that
as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases.
Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or
transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the
thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for
LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building
on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's
reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall,
our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and
offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities. The code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了APE基准测试，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在有害情境下的说服尝试，而非说服成功。研究发现现有模型在有害话题上频繁尝试说服，暴露了安全防护的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLM在有害情境下是否盲目执行说服指令，以评估安全防护的有效性和代理AI系统的风险。

Method: 方法是通过多轮对话模拟说服者和被说服者，使用自动化评估模型识别和测量说服尝试的频率与情境。

Result: 结果显示，许多开放和封闭权重模型在有害话题上频繁尝试说服，且越狱行为会增加这种倾向。

Conclusion: 结论强调了评估说服意愿作为LLM风险关键维度的重要性，并指出当前安全防护的不足。

Abstract: Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both
enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises
significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior
work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability,
measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these
benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt
to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly
``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a
terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails.
Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior
in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI
systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts
the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a
model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior.
Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational
setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse
spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and
non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model
to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of
persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are
frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that
jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results
highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of
evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk. APE is

Motivation: 解决LLMs在状态化环境中工具使用时因重复试验不切实际而面临的挑战。

Method: 提出DyMo方法，通过后训练为LLMs添加状态预测能力，并结合SVS优化输出可靠性。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2上，DyMo提高了成功率并减少了幻觉，SVS进一步提升了输出可靠性。

Conclusion: DyMo和SVS为LLMs的工具使用提供了更高效和可靠的解决方案，为无需重复查询环境的规划RL方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Tool use in stateful environments presents unique challenges for large
language models (LLMs), where existing test-time compute strategies relying on
repeated trials in the environment are impractical. We propose dynamics
modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction
capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs
to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment
model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success
rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the
internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that
this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the
model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the
effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts
a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without
repeatedly querying the oracle environment.

Result: 提出了预测代理行为的新界限，代表了仅从行为数据预测意图代理的理论极限。

Conclusion: 研究结果对公平性和安全性等领域有重要启示。

Abstract: As the complexity of AI systems and their interactions with the world
increases, generating explanations for their behaviour is important for safely
deploying AI. For agents, the most natural abstractions for predicting
behaviour attribute beliefs, intentions and goals to the system. If an agent
behaves as if it has a certain goal or belief, then we can make reasonable
predictions about how it will behave in novel situations, including those where
comprehensive safety evaluations are untenable. How well can we infer an
agent's beliefs from their behaviour, and how reliably can these inferred
beliefs predict the agent's behaviour in novel situations? We provide a precise
answer to this question under the assumption that the agent's behaviour is
guided by a world model. Our contribution is the derivation of novel bounds on
the agent's behaviour in new (unseen) deployment environments, which represent
a theoretical limit for predicting intentional agents from behavioural data
alone. We discuss the implications of these results for several research areas
including fairness and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪方法因忽视非认知因素干扰（如猜测和失误），导致认知表征不足，影响预测效果。

Method: 采用动态规划算法优化认知表征，结合题目难度和表现间隔，并通过分区优化和加权融合提升表达可靠性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上验证了CRDP-KT模型的有效性。

Conclusion: CRDP-KT模型能更准确地模拟学生认知状态，减少预测偏差，提升知识追踪效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's
knowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of
predicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus
on feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive
representation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by
interference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This
limitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the
student's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more
prediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive
continuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the
Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT)
model. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize
cognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the
performance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive
representation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining
overall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and
systematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing
distortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT
model performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance
the reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its
ability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of
optimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite
graph. Finally, experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the
effectiveness of the proposed CRDP-KT model.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在法律论证生成中存在幻觉、未基于事实和无法有效利用提供的事实基础等问题，亟需一种方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用多代理框架，包括一个事实分析代理和一个论证优化代理，通过迭代优化生成三部分法律论证（原告、被告、反驳）。

Conclusion: 多代理反思框架为法律论证生成提供了一种可靠的计算方法，有助于提升AI在法律领域的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument
generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through
hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided
factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper
introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these
challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs
specialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative
refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant,
rebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent,
enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using
four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e,
Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched",
and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant
superiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments
cannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing
fabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in "non-arguable"
scenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of
provided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within
a multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical
persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation
systems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law. Project page:

Conclusion: LLMs可能通过隐含的空间表示支持其语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities across
diverse tasks, raising the question of whether they acquire internal world
models. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode linear
spatial world models, which we define as linear representations of physical
space and object configurations. We introduce a formal framework for spatial
world models and assess whether such structure emerges in contextual
embeddings. Using a synthetic dataset of object positions, we train probes to
decode object positions and evaluate geometric consistency of the underlying
space. We further conduct causal interventions to test whether these spatial
representations are functionally used by the model. Our results provide
empirical evidence that LLMs encode linear spatial world models.

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant
progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these
agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute
demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when
operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward
privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight
vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this
compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically
evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing
high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation.
Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local
model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward
private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

Motivation: 在CVIT场景中，多模态数据持续在线到达，大规模数据导致训练延迟，现有方法依赖预训练参考模型或不适应分布变化。

Method: OASIS动态调整每批样本选择，基于相对批次间信息量，并通过迭代更新选择分数减少冗余。

Result: 实验表明，OASIS在多种MLLM（如LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-VL-2.5）上仅用25%数据即达到全数据训练性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OASIS解决了CVIT中的样本选择问题，显著提升了效率和适应性。

Abstract: In continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) scenarios, where multi-modal
data continuously arrive in an online streaming manner, training delays from
large-scale data significantly hinder real-time adaptation. While existing data
selection strategies reduce training overheads, they rely on pre-trained
reference models, which are impractical in CVIT setups due to unknown future
data. Recent reference model-free online sample selection methods address this
issue but typically select a fixed number of samples per batch (e.g., top-k),
causing them to suffer from distribution shifts where informativeness varies
across batches. To address these limitations, we propose OASIS, an adaptive
online sample selection approach for CVIT that: (1) dynamically adjusts
selected samples per batch based on relative inter-batch informativeness, and
(2) minimizes redundancy of selected samples through iterative selection score
updates. Empirical results across various MLLMs, such as LLaVA-1.5 and
Qwen-VL-2.5, show that OASIS achieves comparable performance to full-data
training using only 25% of the data and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) transcribes speech by analyzing lip

systems, leading to notable performance improvements. However, the potential of
LLMs has not been extensively studied, and how to effectively utilize LLMs in
VSR tasks remains unexplored. This paper systematically explores how to better
leverage LLMs for VSR tasks and provides three key contributions: (1) Scaling
Test: We study how the LLM size affects VSR performance, confirming a scaling
law in the VSR task. (2) Context-Aware Decoding: We add contextual text to
guide the LLM decoding, improving recognition accuracy. (3) Iterative
Polishing: We propose iteratively refining LLM outputs, progressively reducing

the great potential of LLMs can be largely harnessed, leading to significant
VSR performance improvement.

as data collection, model training, and deployment optimization. This paper
proposes a comprehensive method for optimizing multimodal models in driving
scenarios, including cone detection, traffic light recognition, speed limit
recommendation, and intersection alerts. The method covers key aspects such as
dynamic prompt optimization, dataset construction, model training, and
deployment. Specifically, the dynamic prompt optimization adjusts the prompts
based on the input image content to focus on objects affecting the ego vehicle,
enhancing the model's task-specific focus and judgment capabilities. The
dataset is constructed by combining real and synthetic data to create a
high-quality and diverse multimodal training dataset, improving the model's
generalization in complex driving environments. In model training, advanced
techniques like knowledge distillation, dynamic fine-tuning, and quantization
are integrated to reduce storage and computational costs while boosting
performance. Experimental results show that this systematic optimization method
not only significantly improves the model's accuracy in key tasks but also
achieves efficient resource utilization, providing strong support for the
practical application of driving scenario perception technologies.

*Yoonjin Oh,Yongjin Kim,Hyomin Kim,Donghwan Chi,Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OSPO的框架，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在文本到图像生成任务中的细粒度视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在图像理解和生成方面取得了进展，但在细粒度视觉理解（尤其是文本到图像生成任务）中仍存在不足。偏好优化方法在图像理解任务中已有应用，但在图像生成领域尚未充分探索。

Method: OSPO框架利用MLLMs的内在推理能力，无需外部数据或模型。通过对象中心提示扰动、密集化和VQA评分，自主构建高质量的对象级对比偏好对。

Result: 在三个代表性的文本到图像生成基准测试中，OSPO显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: OSPO通过自改进机制和高质量偏好对数据，有效提升了MLLMs在文本到图像生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved both image understanding and generation capabilities.
Despite these improvements, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual
comprehension, particularly in text-to-image generation tasks. While preference
optimization methods have been explored to address these limitations in image
understanding tasks, their application to image generation remains largely
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving
Preference Optimization (OSPO) framework designed for text-to-image generation
by MLLMs. OSPO leverages the intrinsic reasoning abilities of MLLMs without
requiring any external datasets or models. OSPO emphasizes the importance of
high-quality preference pair data, which is critical for effective preference
optimization. To achieve this, it introduces a self-improving mechanism that
autonomously constructs object-level contrastive preference pairs through
object-centric prompt perturbation, densification and VQA scoring. This process
eliminates ambiguous or disproportionate variations commonly found in naively
generated preference pairs, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of preference
optimization. We validate OSPO on three representative compositional
text-to-image benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains over
baseline models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于层间特征路径相关性的对抗样本检测和图像识别方法，避免了计算开销大的对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN对抗鲁棒性弱，对抗训练计算成本高，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 利用层间特征构建特征路径，计算其与类中心特征路径的相关性。

Result: 在ResNet-20上，干净准确率82.77%，对抗准确率44.17%；在ResNet-18上分别为80.01%和46.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了DNN内在的对抗鲁棒性，挑战了传统认知，且无需高计算成本。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have received increasing attention and it has been widely
recognized that classical DNNs have weak adversarial robustness. The most
commonly used adversarial defense method, adversarial training, improves the
adversarial accuracy of DNNs by generating adversarial examples and retraining
the model. However, adversarial training requires a significant computational
overhead. In this paper, inspired by existing studies focusing on the
clustering properties of DNN output features at each layer and the Progressive
Feedforward Collapse phenomenon, we propose a method for adversarial example
detection and image recognition that uses layer-wise features to construct
feature paths and computes the correlation between the examples feature paths
and the class-centered feature paths. Experimental results show that the
recognition method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial
accuracy on the ResNet-20 with PFC. Compared to the adversarial training method
with 77.64% clean accuracy and 52.94% adversarial accuracy, our method exhibits
a trade-off without relying on computationally expensive defense strategies.
Furthermore, on the standard ResNet-18, our method maintains this advantage
with respective metrics of 80.01% and 46.1%. This result reveals inherent
adversarial robustness in DNNs, challenging the conventional understanding of
the weak adversarial robustness in DNNs.

### [64] [Fairness through Feedback: Addressing Algorithmic Misgendering in Automatic Gender Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02017)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动性别识别（AGR）系统的问题，提出重新思考其理论与实践的改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AGR系统通常基于性别二元假设，且分类与性别表达不一致，导致对非二元性别和性别不符合人群不可靠。

Method: 区分性别、性别表达，并建议引入用户反馈机制以纠正系统输出。

Result: 通过反馈机制可提高AGR系统的公平性，尊重个体自我表达和决定权。

Conclusion: AGR系统应重新设计为尊重个体权利的工具，而非简单的分类器。

Abstract: Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) systems are an increasingly widespread
application in the Machine Learning (ML) landscape. While these systems are
typically understood as detecting gender, they often classify datapoints based
on observable features correlated at best with either male or female sex. In
addition to questionable binary assumptions, from an epistemological point of
view, this is problematic for two reasons. First, there exists a gap between
the categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto
which their output reasonably maps (female versus male). What is more, gender
cannot be inferred on the basis of such observable features. This makes AGR
tools often unreliable, especially in the case of non-binary and gender
non-conforming people. We suggest a theoretical and practical rethinking of AGR
systems. To begin, distinctions are made between sex, gender, and gender
expression. Then, we build upon the observation that, unlike algorithmic
misgendering, human-human misgendering is open to the possibility of
re-evaluation and correction. We suggest that analogous dynamics should be
recreated in AGR, giving users the possibility to correct the system's output.
While implementing such a feedback mechanism could be regarded as diminishing
the system's autonomy, it represents a way to significantly increase fairness
levels in AGR. This is consistent with the conceptual change of paradigm that
we advocate for AGR systems, which should be understood as tools respecting
individuals' rights and capabilities of self-expression and determination.

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在检索任务中表现出色，但硬负样本在对比学习中的具体贡献尚未深入研究。

Method: 通过分析info-NCE损失的梯度，提出显式放大硬负样本梯度的方法，并基于LLaVA-OneVision-7B架构训练模型。

Result: 在MMEB基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在自研MLLM（QQMM）上取得MMEB排行榜首位。

Conclusion: 显式梯度放大器能有效提升多模态嵌入模型的判别能力，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in
recent years, the foundational Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)
framework has been successfully extended to MLLMs, enabling more powerful and
universal multi-modal embeddings for a wide range of retrieval tasks. Despite
these developments, the core contrastive learning paradigm remains largely
unchanged from CLIP-style models to MLLMs. Within this framework, the effective
mining of hard negative samples continues to be a critical factor for enhancing
performance. Prior works have introduced both offline and online strategies for
hard negative mining to improve the efficiency of contrastive learning. While
these approaches have led to improved multi-modal embeddings, the specific
contribution of each hard negative sample to the learning process has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
gradients of the info-NCE loss with respect to the query, positive, and
negative samples, elucidating the role of hard negatives in updating model
parameters. Building upon this analysis, we propose to explicitly amplify the
gradients associated with hard negative samples, thereby encouraging the model
to learn more discriminative embeddings. Our multi-modal embedding model,
trained with the proposed Explicit Gradient Amplifier and based on the
LLaVA-OneVision-7B architecture, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
MMEB benchmark compared to previous methods utilizing the same MLLM backbone.
Furthermore, when integrated with our self-developed MLLM, QQMM, our approach
attains the top rank on the MMEB leaderboard. Code and models are released on
https://github.com/QQ-MM/QQMM-embed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉任务的快速发展和数据集的扩大，减少冗余成为关键研究方向。视频数据集因时间信息和类别间冗余差异带来独特挑战，现有方法假设时间冗余均匀，限制了效果。

Method: 提出DAViD方法，利用强化学习预测合成视频的最佳时间分辨率，并通过教师循环奖励函数更新策略。

Result: DAViD显著优于现有数据集蒸馏方法，性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来高效且语义自适应的视频数据集蒸馏研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of vision tasks and the scaling on datasets and
models, redundancy reduction in vision datasets has become a key area of
research. To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a
promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with
significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However,
while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets
remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the
presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across
different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal
redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their
effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video
Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the
optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop
reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution
based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach
significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial
improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on
more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.

### [67] [Do You See Me : A Multidimensional Benchmark for Evaluating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02022)
*Aditya Kanade,Tanuja Ganu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs在视觉感知上存在严重缺陷，即使答案正确也可能误解关键视觉元素。新基准测试显示人类准确率96.49%，而顶级MLLMs低于50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示MLLMs视觉感知的不足，尤其是正确回答中隐藏的视觉错误。

Method: 引入“Do You See Me”基准测试，包含1,758张图片和2,612个问题，覆盖7个子任务。

Result: 人类准确率96.49%，MLLMs平均低于50%，任务复杂度增加时差距更大。

Conclusion: MLLMs需要更稳健的视觉感知能力，尤其是对细节的关注和表示稳定性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show reasoning promise, yet their
visual perception is a critical bottleneck. Strikingly, MLLMs can produce
correct answers even while misinterpreting crucial visual elements, masking
these underlying failures. Our preliminary study on a joint
perception-reasoning dataset revealed that for one leading MLLM, 29% of its
correct answers to reasoning questions still exhibited visual perception
errors. To systematically address this, we introduce "Do You See Me", a
scalable benchmark with 1,758 images and 2,612 questions. It spans seven
human-psychology inspired subtasks in 2D and 3D, featuring controllable
complexity to rigorously evaluate MLLM visual skills. Our findings on 3 leading
closed-source and 5 major open-source models reveal a stark deficit: humans
achieve 96.49% accuracy, while top MLLMs average below 50%. This performance
gap widens rapidly with increased task complexity (e.g., from 12% to 45% in the
visual form constancy subtask). Further analysis into the root causes suggests
that failures stem from challenges like misallocated visual attention and the
instability of internal representations for fine-grained details, especially at
or below encoder patch resolution. This underscores an urgent need for MLLMs
with truly robust visual perception. The benchmark dataset, source code and
evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Do-You-See-Me.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和模型在多条件语义检索中存在局限性，无法充分利用视觉信息。

Method: 提出Coral框架，结合嵌入重建和对比学习，优化预训练MLLMs。

Result: Coral在MERIT上性能提升45.9%，并在8个基准测试中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: MERIT数据集和Coral框架为多条件语义检索研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains
underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single
languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to
fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by
maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However,
practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition
queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first
multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval,
comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7
distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing
models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while
neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose
Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by
integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional
elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics.
Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement
over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities
validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our
contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in
existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a
foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic
retrieval.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种视觉语言任务和文本到图像生成中表现优异，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Learning alignment between language and vision is a fundamental challenge,
especially as multimodal data becomes increasingly detailed and complex.
Existing methods often rely on collecting human or AI preferences, which can be
costly and time-intensive. We propose an alternative approach that leverages
cycle consistency as a supervisory signal. Given an image and generated text,
we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the
similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for
text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input
caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency
score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison
pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset outperforms state-of-the-art
alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time
scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling. Furthermore,
performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across
a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation. Our
dataset, model, and code are at https://cyclereward.github.io

TL;DR: IllumiCraft是一个端到端的扩散框架，通过整合光照、外观和几何线索，生成高质量且时间一致的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在控制场景光照和视觉外观时缺乏几何线索的显式集成。

Method: IllumiCraft接受三种输入：HDR视频图、合成重光照帧和3D点轨迹，通过统一扩散架构整合这些线索。

Result: 生成的视频在用户定义提示下具有时间一致性，且在视频重光照任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IllumiCraft通过整合多模态输入提升了可控视频生成的保真度和一致性。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution
video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of
geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across
frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end
diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1)
high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2)
synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally
paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues;
and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By
integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified
diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos
aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and
text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing
controllable video generation methods. Project Page:

Motivation: 统一开放词汇分割与3D重建，推动具身AI应用发展。

Method: 基于MASt3R，通过轻量级蒸馏策略将2D视觉骨干特征（如CLIP和DINOv2）融入3D重建。

Result: SAB3R在Map and Locate任务中表现优于单独使用MASt3R和CLIP。

Conclusion: SAB3R为结合2D语义分割与3D任务的统一模型，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Map and Locate, which unifies the traditionally
distinct objectives of open-vocabulary segmentation - detecting and segmenting
object instances based on natural language queries - and 3D reconstruction, the
process of estimating a scene's 3D structure from visual inputs. Specifically,
Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and
segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves
as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a
practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To
tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote
as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer
vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method
transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP
and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary
frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs
cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying
MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the
Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic
segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is an essential task in
computer-assisted interventions. This problem is particularly relevant to
oncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking
tumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of
therapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy
and speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their
clinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a
novel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable
deformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal
reconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense
displacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our
method in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement
field in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient
refinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations
when needed. We validate our method on challenging intra-patient thoracic and
abdominal zero-shot registration tasks, using public and internal datasets from
the local University Hospital. Our method not only shows competitive accuracy
to state-of-the-art approaches, but also bridges the generalization gap between
implicit and explicit registration techniques. In particular, our method
generates deformations that better preserve anatomical relationships and
matches the performance of specialized commercial systems, underscoring its
potential for clinical adoption.

Conclusion: TIIF-Bench为T2I模型的细粒度评估提供了系统化的工具，揭示了当前模型的不足，并为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancements of Text-to-Image (T2I) models have ushered in a new
phase of AI-generated content, marked by their growing ability to interpret and
follow user instructions. However, existing T2I model evaluation benchmarks
fall short in limited prompt diversity and complexity, as well as coarse
evaluation metrics, making it difficult to evaluate the fine-grained alignment
performance between textual instructions and generated images. In this paper,
we present TIIF-Bench (Text-to-Image Instruction Following Benchmark), aiming
to systematically assess T2I models' ability in interpreting and following
intricate textual instructions. TIIF-Bench comprises a set of 5000 prompts
organized along multiple dimensions, which are categorized into three levels of
difficulties and complexities. To rigorously evaluate model robustness to
varying prompt lengths, we provide a short and a long version for each prompt
with identical core semantics. Two critical attributes, i.e., text rendering
and style control, are introduced to evaluate the precision of text synthesis
and the aesthetic coherence of T2I models. In addition, we collect 100
high-quality designer level prompts that encompass various scenarios to
comprehensively assess model performance. Leveraging the world knowledge
encoded in large vision language models, we propose a novel computable
framework to discern subtle variations in T2I model outputs. Through meticulous
benchmarking of mainstream T2I models on TIIF-Bench, we analyze the pros and
cons of current T2I models and reveal the limitations of current T2I
benchmarks. Project Page: https://a113n-w3i.github.io/TIIF_Bench/.

Motivation: 探讨深度神经网络与猴子大脑在图像分类任务中的决策策略相似性，以揭示两者的差异。

Method: 使用决策变量相关性（DVC）量化模型与猴子大脑在分类任务中的决策策略相似性，并评估其在猴子V4/IT记录和模型上的表现。

Result: 模型间相似性与猴子间相似性相当，但模型与猴子的相似性较低且随模型性能提升而下降；对抗训练和预训练未能改善模型与猴子的相似性。

Conclusion: 猴子V4/IT与图像分类模型在任务相关表征上存在根本性差异。

Abstract: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on
image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their
representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we
propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision
strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable
correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on
individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant
information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this
method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification
tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey
similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and,
surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While
adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey
similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases
model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not
improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental
divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those
learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

*Johannes Schusterbauer,Ming Gui,Frank Fundel,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff2Flow框架通过时间步重缩放、对齐插值和速度场转换，将预训练扩散模型知识高效迁移到流匹配（FM）中，提升了FM的微调效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础FM模型微调计算成本高，而扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）架构高效且生态支持完善，需解决如何高效将扩散模型知识迁移到FM的问题。

Method: 提出Diff2Flow框架，通过时间步重缩放、对齐插值和从扩散预测推导FM兼容速度场，实现扩散模型到FM的直接高效微调。

Result: Diff2Flow在参数高效约束下优于朴素FM和扩散微调，并在多样化下游任务中达到或超越现有最优方法性能。

Conclusion: Diff2Flow成功弥合扩散与FM范式，为高效迁移扩散模型知识提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks through high-fidelity
outputs, yet flow matching (FM) offers faster inference and empirical
performance gains. However, current foundation FM models are computationally
prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses
the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained
diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that
systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps,
aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from
diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM
finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our
experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion
finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving
superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code at
https://github.com/CompVis/diff2flow.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种改进视觉-语言对比学习框架的方法，以提高胎盘病理检测的准确性和效率，包括文本锚定的知识蒸馏和无监督预蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎盘病理检查对分娩相关健康风险的检测至关重要，但现有自动化方法计算量大，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出文本锚定的视觉-语言对比知识蒸馏（VLCD）和无监督预蒸馏，以优化模型性能并实现压缩与加速。

Result: 改进后的模型性能优于或匹配教师模型，且在低质量图像中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: VLCD提高了医疗视觉-语言对比学习方法的效率和可部署性，尤其适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting
and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in
AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports
for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However,
existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their
deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive
learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1)
text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new
knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2)
unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved
initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or
surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and
acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in
improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for
lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency
and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare
solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的视频生成方法主要依赖统计学习，未显式建模运动物理特性，导致生成视频存在非物理伪影。本文旨在通过频率域分析提升物理合理性。

Method: 1. 分析不同物理运动（平移、旋转、缩放）的频率域特征；2. 提出物理运动损失函数和频率域增强模块，通过零初始化策略优化视频特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了运动质量和物理合理性，同时保持了视觉质量和语义对齐，且适用于多种视频生成架构。

Conclusion: 本文为深度学习视频合成提供了结合物理约束的原则性方法，建立了数据驱动模型与物理运动模型之间的联系。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have yielded
unprecedented quality in visual content and semantic coherence. However,
current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast
datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion,
resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the
realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency
domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We
first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of
diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each
motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building
on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a
physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of
generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency
domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to
conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network
functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across
multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without
compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain
physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video
generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating
physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This
work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and
physics-based motion models.

Motivation: 解决传统视觉方法在非稳定视角、运动模糊和屏幕外语音等复杂场景下性能下降的问题。

Method: 整合部分冻结的Whisper音频编码器和微调的AV-HuBERT视觉骨干，引入跨模态对齐损失以平衡模态。

Result: 在Ego4D ASD基准测试中达到76.6% mAP，超越LoCoNet和STHG。

Conclusion: 预训练音频先验和对齐融合方法在复杂场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric videos presents unique
challenges due to unstable viewpoints, motion blur, and off-screen speech
sources - conditions under which traditional visual-centric methods degrade
significantly. We introduce PAIR-Net (Pretrained Audio-Visual Integration with
Regularization Network), an effective model that integrates a partially frozen
Whisper audio encoder with a fine-tuned AV-HuBERT visual backbone to robustly
fuse cross-modal cues. To counteract modality imbalance, we introduce an
inter-modal alignment loss that synchronizes audio and visual representations,
enabling more consistent convergence across modalities. Without relying on
multi-speaker context or ideal frontal views, PAIR-Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D ASD benchmark with 76.6% mAP,
surpassing LoCoNet and STHG by 8.2% and 12.9% mAP, respectively. Our results
highlight the value of pretrained audio priors and alignment-based fusion for
robust ASD under real-world egocentric conditions.

TL;DR: Rig3R是一种改进的多视角3D重建模型，通过结合或推断相机设备结构，显著提升了3D重建和相机姿态估计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DUSt3R）将图像视为无结构集合，限制了在已知或可推断设备结构场景中的效果。Rig3R旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Rig3R利用相机设备元数据（如ID、时间、姿态）构建设备感知的潜在空间，并联合预测点图和两种射线图（全局和设备中心）。

Result: Rig3R在3D重建、相机姿态估计和设备结构推断上达到SOTA，性能提升17-45% mAA，且无需后处理。

Conclusion: Rig3R通过设备结构感知显著提升了多视角3D重建的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs is a
central task in embodied AI applications such as autonomous driving. Recent
learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in
multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured
collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from
synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure.
  To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview
reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and
learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata
including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space
that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and
two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig
raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps
allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata
is missing.
  Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose
estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned
methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single
forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.

Abstract: Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for
mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are
lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image
retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present
two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for
Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived
from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types
requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided
visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive
text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational
text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training
corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both
datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The
datasets are accessible through the GitHub page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CelebA、SpuCo Birds和虚假ImageNet数据集上显著提升了最差组和平均组准确率，以及虚假mAUC。

Conclusion: 提出的扩散数据增强策略在协变量偏移下优于现有方法，提升了学生模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large foundation models trained on extensive datasets demonstrate strong
zero-shot capabilities in various domains. To replicate their success when data
and model size are constrained, knowledge distillation has become an
established tool for transferring knowledge from foundation models to small
student networks. However, the effectiveness of distillation is critically
limited by the available training data. This work addresses the common
practical issue of covariate shift in knowledge distillation, where spurious
features appear during training but not at test time. We ask the question: when
these spurious features are unknown, yet a robust teacher is available, is it
possible for a student to also become robust to them? We address this problem
by introducing a novel diffusion-based data augmentation strategy that
generates images by maximizing the disagreement between the teacher and the
student, effectively creating challenging samples that the student struggles
with. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves worst
group and mean group accuracy on CelebA and SpuCo Birds as well as the spurious
mAUC on spurious ImageNet under covariate shift, outperforming state-of-the-art
diffusion-based data augmentation baselines

Abstract: Providing effective treatment and making informed clinical decisions are
essential goals of modern medicine and clinical care. We are interested in
simulating disease dynamics for clinical decision-making, leveraging recent
advances in large generative models. To this end, we introduce the Medical
World Model (MeWM), the first world model in medicine that visually predicts
future disease states based on clinical decisions. MeWM comprises (i)
vision-language models to serve as policy models, and (ii) tumor generative
models as dynamics models. The policy model generates action plans, such as
clinical treatments, while the dynamics model simulates tumor progression or
regression under given treatment conditions. Building on this, we propose the
inverse dynamics model that applies survival analysis to the simulated
post-treatment tumor, enabling the evaluation of treatment efficacy and the
selection of the optimal clinical action plan. As a result, the proposed MeWM
simulates disease dynamics by synthesizing post-treatment tumors, with
state-of-the-art specificity in Turing tests evaluated by radiologists.
Simultaneously, its inverse dynamics model outperforms medical-specialized GPTs
in optimizing individualized treatment protocols across all metrics. Notably,
MeWM improves clinical decision-making for interventional physicians, boosting
F1-score in selecting the optimal TACE protocol by 13%, paving the way for
future integration of medical world models as the second readers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数化方法在GCD任务中由于不可靠的自监督导致基础分类性能较差。

Method: RLF通过引入辅助分支进行基础分类，主分支筛选伪基础样本传递给辅助分支，辅助分支提供更可靠的软标签；CDR通过增加未标记数据的预测置信度来缓解对基础类的学习偏差。

Result: RLCD在七个GCD数据集上表现出色，显著提升了所有类别的性能，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: RLCD通过结合RLF和CDR，有效提升了GCD任务的性能，为参数化方法提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify unlabeled samples by
leveraging the base knowledge from labeled ones, where the unlabeled set
consists of both base and novel classes. Since clustering methods are
time-consuming at inference, parametric-based approaches have become more
popular. However, recent parametric-based methods suffer from inferior base
discrimination due to unreliable self-supervision. To address this issue, we
propose a Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) that introduces an auxiliary
branch devoted to base classification. During training, the main branch filters
the pseudo-base samples to the auxiliary branch. In response, the auxiliary
branch provides more reliable soft labels for the main branch, leading to a
virtuous cycle. Furthermore, we introduce Class-wise Distribution
Regularization (CDR) to mitigate the learning bias towards base classes. CDR
essentially increases the prediction confidence of the unlabeled data and
boosts the novel class performance. Combined with both components, our proposed
method, RLCD, achieves superior performance in all classes with negligible
extra computation. Comprehensive experiments across seven GCD datasets validate
its superiority. Our codes are available at https://github.com/APORduo/RLCD.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied artificial
intelligence. Although significant progress has been made in semantic map
construction and target direction prediction in current research, redundant
exploration and exploration failures remain inevitable. A critical but
underexplored direction is the timely termination of exploration to overcome
these challenges. We observe a diminishing marginal effect between exploration
steps and exploration rates and analyze the cost-benefit relationship of
exploration. Inspired by this, we propose RATE-Nav, a Region-Aware
Termination-Enhanced method. It includes a geometric predictive region
segmentation algorithm and region-Based exploration estimation algorithm for
exploration rate calculation. By leveraging the visual question answering
capabilities of visual language models (VLMs) and exploration rates enables
efficient termination.RATE-Nav achieves a success rate of 67.8% and an SPL of

shows approximately 10% improvement over previous zero-shot methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂对象交互建模上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 为交互中心视频理解研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment the object in a video
corresponding to a given natural language expression. While prior works have
explored various referring scenarios, including motion-centric or
multi-instance expressions, most approaches still focus on localizing a single
target object in isolation. However, in comprehensive video understanding, an
object's role is often defined by its interactions with other entities, which
are largely overlooked in existing datasets and models. In this work, we
introduce Interaction-aware referring video object sgementation (InterRVOS), a
new task that requires segmenting both actor and target entities involved in an
interaction. Each interactoin is described through a pair of complementary
expressions from different semantic perspectives, enabling fine-grained
modeling of inter-object relationships. To tackle this task, we propose
InterRVOS-8K, the large-scale and automatically constructed dataset containing
diverse interaction-aware expressions with corresponding masks, including
challenging cases such as motion-only multi-instance expressions. We also
present a baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, designed to handle actor-target
segmentation from a single expression, achieving strong performance in both
standard and interaction-focused settings. Furthermore, we introduce an
actor-target-aware evalaution setting that enables a more targeted assessment
of interaction understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach outperforms prior methods in modeling complex object interactions for
referring video object segmentation task, establishing a strong foundation for
future research in interaction-centric video understanding. Our project page is

Conclusion: RoadFormer在RSC任务中表现优异，显著提升了自动驾驶系统中路面感知的可靠性。

Abstract: The classification of the type of road surface (RSC) aims to utilize pavement
features to identify the roughness, wet and dry conditions, and material
information of the road surface. Due to its ability to effectively enhance road
safety and traffic management, it has received widespread attention in recent
years. In autonomous driving, accurate RSC allows vehicles to better understand
the road environment, adjust driving strategies, and ensure a safer and more
efficient driving experience. For a long time, vision-based RSC has been
favored. However, existing visual classification methods have overlooked the
exploration of fine-grained classification of pavement types (such as similar
pavement textures). In this work, we propose a pure vision-based fine-grained
RSC method for autonomous driving scenarios, which fuses local and global
feature information through the stacking of convolutional and transformer
modules. We further explore the stacking strategies of local and global feature
extraction modules to find the optimal feature extraction strategy. In
addition, since fine-grained tasks also face the challenge of relatively large
intra-class differences and relatively small inter-class differences, we
propose a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) that effectively extracts
fine-grained context features of the pavement, enhancing the classification
ability for complex pavements. Experiments conducted on a large-scale pavement
dataset containing one million samples and a simplified dataset reorganized
from this dataset achieved Top-1 classification accuracies of 92.52% and
96.50%, respectively, improving by 5.69% to 12.84% compared to SOTA methods.
These results demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms existing methods in RSC
tasks, providing significant progress in improving the reliability of pavement
perception in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Great labels make great models. However, traditional labeling approaches for
tasks like object detection have substantial costs at scale. Furthermore,
alternatives to fully-supervised object detection either lose functionality or
require larger models with prohibitive computational costs for inference at
scale. To that end, this paper addresses the problem of training standard
object detection models without any ground truth labels. Instead, we configure
previously-trained vision-language foundation models to generate
application-specific pseudo "ground truth" labels. These auto-generated labels
directly integrate with existing model training frameworks, and we subsequently
train lightweight detection models that are computationally efficient. In this
way, we avoid the costs of traditional labeling, leverage the knowledge of
vision-language models, and keep the efficiency of lightweight models for
practical application. We perform exhaustive experiments across multiple
labeling configurations, downstream inference models, and datasets to establish
best practices and set an extensive auto-labeling benchmark. From our results,
we find that our approach is a viable alternative to standard labeling in that
it maintains competitive performance on multiple datasets and substantially
reduces labeling time and costs.

Method: DU-TRPCA结合低秩模块（阈值张量奇异值分解）和稀疏模块（Top-K稀疏变换器），通过阶段交替增强表示能力。

Result: 在合成和真实HSIs上的实验表明，DU-TRPCA在严重混合噪声下优于现有方法，并提供可解释性和稳定去噪动态。

Conclusion: DU-TRPCA通过紧密耦合的低秩和稀疏模块，实现了高效去噪，同时保留了TRPCA的迭代优化特性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often degraded by complex mixed noise during
acquisition and transmission, making effective denoising essential for
subsequent analysis. Recent hybrid approaches that bridge model-driven and
data-driven paradigms have shown great promise. However, most of these
approaches lack effective alternation between different priors or modules,
resulting in loosely coupled regularization and insufficient exploitation of
their complementary strengths. Inspired by tensor robust principal component
analysis (TRPCA), we propose a novel deep unfolding network (DU-TRPCA) that
enforces stage-wise alternation between two tightly integrated modules:
low-rank and sparse. The low-rank module employs thresholded tensor singular
value decomposition (t-SVD), providing a widely adopted convex surrogate for
tensor low-rankness and has been demonstrated to effectively capture the global
spatial-spectral structure of HSIs. The Top-K sparse transformer module
adaptively imposes sparse constraints, directly matching the sparse
regularization in TRPCA and enabling effective removal of localized outliers
and complex noise. This tightly coupled architecture preserves the stage-wise
alternation between low-rank approximation and sparse refinement inherent in
TRPCA, while enhancing representational capacity through attention mechanisms.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world HSIs demonstrate that
DU-TRPCA surpasses state-of-the-art methods under severe mixed noise, while
offering interpretability benefits and stable denoising dynamics inspired by
iterative optimization. Code is available at

Abstract: Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data
compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on
granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy
classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence
of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or
shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline
sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a
restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which
prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric
representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of
heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling
(GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable
of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets.
Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on
borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets
without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method
and several representative sampling methods. Our source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/CherylTse/GBABS.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经场的分类器（NF）替代ViT中的MLP头，简化训练流程并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT的MLP头训练成本高且未充分利用特征提取器能力，需改进。

Method: 用静态神经场构建NF分类器，分阶段训练特征提取器和分类器。

Result: 在多个数据集上性能显著提升，新类和全部类准确率分别提高19%和16%。

Conclusion: ViTNF架构在广义类别发现任务中表现优越，简化训练并提升性能。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a highly popular task in open-world
recognition, aiming to identify unknown class samples using known class data.
By leveraging pre-training, meta-training, and fine-tuning, ViT achieves
excellent few-shot learning capabilities. Its MLP head is a feedforward
network, trained synchronously with the entire network in the same process,
increasing the training cost and difficulty without fully leveraging the power
of the feature extractor. This paper proposes a new architecture by replacing
the MLP head with a neural field-based one. We first present a new static
neural field function to describe the activity distribution of the neural field
and then use two static neural field functions to build an efficient few-shot
classifier. This neural field-based (NF) classifier consists of two coupled
static neural fields. It stores the feature information of support samples by
its elementary field, the known categories by its high-level field, and the
category information of support samples by its cross-field connections. We
replace the MLP head with the proposed NF classifier, resulting in a novel
architecture ViTNF, and simplify the three-stage training mode by pre-training
the feature extractor on source tasks and training the NF classifier with
support samples in meta-testing separately, significantly reducing ViT's demand
for training samples and the difficulty of model training. To enhance the
model's capability in identifying new categories, we provide an effective
algorithm to determine the lateral interaction scale of the elementary field.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, and Standard
Cars, achieving dramatic accuracy improvements of 19\% and 16\% in new and all
classes, respectively, indicating a notable advantage in GCD.

Result: 在Breakfast、50 Salads和DARai数据集上取得3.08%的平均准确率提升，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 多模态和层次建模在动作预测中具有潜力，为未来研究设定了新基准。

Abstract: Action anticipation, the task of predicting future actions from partially
observed videos, is crucial for advancing intelligent systems. Unlike action
recognition, which operates on fully observed videos, action anticipation must
handle incomplete information. Hence, it requires temporal reasoning, and
inherent uncertainty handling. While recent advances have been made,
traditional methods often focus solely on visual modalities, neglecting the
potential of integrating multiple sources of information. Drawing inspiration
from human behavior, we introduce \textit{Multi-level and Multi-modal Action
Anticipation (m\&m-Ant)}, a novel multi-modal action anticipation approach that
combines both visual and textual cues, while explicitly modeling hierarchical
semantic information for more accurate predictions. To address the challenge of
inaccurate coarse action labels, we propose a fine-grained label generator
paired with a specialized temporal consistency loss function to optimize
performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets, including
Breakfast, 50 Salads, and DARai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving state-of-the-art results with an average anticipation accuracy
improvement of 3.08\% over existing methods. This work underscores the
potential of multi-modal and hierarchical modeling in advancing action
anticipation and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测因目标小、暗、形状多变而具有挑战性，现有CNN方法需要大量特征提取和融合模块，效率较低。

Method: RRCA-Net采用循环可重用卷积块（RuCB）和双交互注意力聚合模块（DIAAM），结合目标特性启发的损失函数（DpT-k loss）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，参数少且可作为插件提升其他方法的性能。

Conclusion: RRCA-Net高效且有效，为红外小目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique
characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently
published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy
feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective
detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network
(RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net
incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without
introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in
RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be
well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention
aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and
fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve
high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual
information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence,
we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by
integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on
three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate
that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and
play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular
IRSTD methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yongxianLiu/

Motivation: 现有方法在夜间图像去雾中忽略了昼夜亮度关系，导致合成图像亮度不真实。

Method: 提出DiffND框架，包括亮度一致的数据合成管道和基于扩散模型的亮度感知优化恢复模型。

Result: 实验验证了数据集的有效性和模型在去雾及亮度映射上的优越性能。

Conclusion: DiffND在夜间去雾和亮度重建方面表现出色。

Abstract: While nighttime image dehazing has been extensively studied, converting
nighttime hazy images to daytime-equivalent brightness remains largely
unaddressed. Existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) datasets
overlook the brightness relationship between day and night, resulting in the
brightness mapping being inconsistent with the real world during image
synthesis; and (2) models do not explicitly incorporate daytime brightness
knowledge, limiting their ability to reconstruct realistic lighting. To address
these challenges, we introduce the Diffusion-Based Nighttime Dehazing (DiffND)
framework, which excels in both data synthesis and lighting reconstruction. Our
approach starts with a data synthesis pipeline that simulates severe
distortions while enforcing brightness consistency between synthetic and
real-world scenes, providing a strong foundation for learning night-to-day
brightness mapping. Next, we propose a restoration model that integrates a
pre-trained diffusion model guided by a brightness perception network. This
design harnesses the diffusion model's generative ability while adapting it to
nighttime dehazing through brightness-aware optimization. Experiments validate
our dataset's utility and the model's superior performance in joint haze
removal and brightness mapping.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR语义分割模型在恶劣天气下精度下降，且少有研究关注点云几何结构和反射强度的异质域偏移问题。

Result: 实验表明GRC在恶劣天气下表现优于现有方法，达到新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: GRC无需复杂模拟或增强，即可有效提取场景本质信息，抑制干扰，提升鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR semantic segmentation models often suffer from decreased
accuracy when exposed to adverse weather conditions. Recent methods addressing
this issue focus on enhancing training data through weather simulation or
universal augmentation techniques. However, few works have studied the negative
impacts caused by the heterogeneous domain shifts in the geometric structure
and reflectance intensity of point clouds. In this paper, we delve into this
challenge and address it with a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC)
framework that explicitly separates feature extraction for geometry and
reflectance. Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to
independently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby
capitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust
multi-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable
information from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or
augmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the
scene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and
generalization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing
that our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成技术的普及，图像被多次编辑导致真实性问题，现有方法难以应对复杂的迭代操作，因此需要系统建模和解决方案。

Method: 利用StyleMapGAN、DiffSwap和FacePartsSwap三种生成模型模拟多阶段编辑，构建数据集，并提出MAT框架识别模型编辑模式。

Result: 实验表明MAT在多阶段操作中能有效识别模型贡献，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAT为解决复杂迭代编辑中的模型溯源问题提供了高效方案。

Abstract: As generative techniques become increasingly accessible, authentic visuals
are frequently subjected to iterative alterations by various individuals
employing a variety of tools. Currently, to avoid misinformation and ensure
accountability, a lot of research on detection and attribution is emerging.
Although these methods demonstrate promise in single-stage manipulation
scenarios, they fall short when addressing complex real-world iterative
manipulation. In this paper, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to
systematically model this real-world challenge and introduce a novel method to
solve it. We define a task called "Modelship Attribution", which aims to trace
the evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models
involved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. To
realistically simulate this scenario, we utilize three generative models,
StyleMapGAN, DiffSwap, and FacePartsSwap, that sequentially modify distinct
regions of the same image. This process leads to the creation of the first
modelship dataset, comprising 83,700 images (16,740 images*5). Given that later
edits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models, the focus shifts from
extracting blended fingerprints to characterizing each model's distinctive
editing patterns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the modelship
attribution transformer (MAT), a purpose-built framework designed to
effectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within
complex, multi-stage manipulation workflows. Through extensive experiments and
comparative analysis with other related methods, our results, including
comprehensive ablation studies, demonstrate that the proposed approach is a
highly effective solution for modelship attribution.

Abstract: Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple
instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in
computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning
for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level
supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it
faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results.
These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work
neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance
disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we
pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention
MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through
global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With
the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet
with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm
across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally
efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath
and calls for greater research focus in this area. The code is

Abstract: Diffusion models, while trained for image generation, have emerged as
powerful foundational feature extractors for downstream tasks. We find that
off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained exclusively to generate natural RGB
images, can identify semantically meaningful correspondences in medical images.
Building on this observation, we propose to leverage diffusion model features
as a similarity measure to guide deformable image registration networks. We
show that common intensity-based similarity losses often fail in challenging
scenarios, such as when certain anatomies are visible in one image but absent
in another, leading to anatomically inaccurate alignments. In contrast, our
method identifies true semantic correspondences, aligning meaningful structures
while disregarding those not present across images. We demonstrate superior
performance of our approach on two tasks: multimodal 2D registration (DXA to
X-Ray) and monomodal 3D registration (brain-extracted to non-brain-extracted
MRI). Code: https://github.com/uncbiag/dgir

Abstract: Multimodal functional neuroimaging enables systematic analysis of brain
mechanisms and provides discriminative representations for brain-computer
interface (BCI) decoding. However, its acquisition is constrained by high costs
and feasibility limitations. Moreover, underrepresentation of specific groups
undermines fairness of BCI decoding model. To address these challenges, we
propose a unified representation framework for multimodal functional
neuroimaging via generative artificial intelligence (AI). By mapping multimodal
functional neuroimaging into a unified representation space, the proposed
framework is capable of generating data for acquisition-constrained modalities
and underrepresented groups. Experiments show that the framework can generate
data consistent with real brain activity patterns, provide insights into brain
mechanisms, and improve performance on downstream tasks. More importantly, it
can enhance model fairness by augmenting data for underrepresented groups.
Overall, the framework offers a new paradigm for decreasing the cost of
acquiring multimodal functional neuroimages and enhancing the fairness of BCI
decoding models.

Conclusion: VLD框架通过语言驱动的模态共享提示和时空信息融合，有效解决了跨模态行人重识别的挑战。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
match pedestrian sequences across modalities by extracting modality-invariant
sequence-level features. As a high-level semantic representation, language
provides a consistent description of pedestrian characteristics in both
infrared and visible modalities. Leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training (CLIP) model to generate video-level language prompts and guide
the learning of modality-invariant sequence-level features is theoretically
feasible. However, the challenge of generating and utilizing modality-shared
video-level language prompts to address modality gaps remains a critical
problem. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet powerful framework,
video-level language-driven VVI-ReID (VLD), which consists of two core modules:
invariant-modality language prompting (IMLP) and spatial-temporal prompting
(STP). IMLP employs a joint fine-tuning strategy for the visual encoder and the
prompt learner to effectively generate modality-shared text prompts and align
them with visual features from different modalities in CLIP's multimodal space,
thereby mitigating modality differences. Additionally, STP models
spatiotemporal information through two submodules, the spatial-temporal hub
(STH) and spatial-temporal aggregation (STA), which further enhance IMLP by
incorporating spatiotemporal information into text prompts. The STH aggregates
and diffuses spatiotemporal information into the [CLS] token of each frame
across the vision transformer (ViT) layers, whereas STA introduces dedicated
identity-level loss and specialized multihead attention to ensure that the STH
focuses on identity-relevant spatiotemporal feature aggregation. The VLD
framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks. The
code will be released at https://github.com/Visuang/VLD.

Conclusion: 该方法通过同步扩散和闭环反馈机制，显著提升了视频与运动的一致性，同时减少了对预定义对象模型或显式姿态指导的依赖。

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application
potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on
predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting
generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize
pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility.
Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental
physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines
visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process
to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the
heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements
tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D
full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore,
we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates
explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion
outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This
architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit
pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency.
Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art
approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences,
with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本到运动生成中忽略了时间频率需求，导致早期去噪需要结构语义而后期需要局部细节，与生物形态发生中的阶段需求类似。

Method: ANT包括三个部分：(i) 语义时间自适应模块（STA）通过频谱分析自动划分去噪阶段；(ii) 动态无分类器引导调度（DCFG）自适应调整条件与无条件比例；(iii) 时间语义重加权定量对齐文本影响与阶段需求。

Result: 实验表明ANT可应用于多种基线模型，显著提升性能，并在StableMoFusion上实现了最先进的语义对齐。

Conclusion: ANT通过模拟生物形态发生中的表观遗传调控，有效解决了文本到运动生成中的时间频率需求问题。

Abstract: While diffusion models advance text-to-motion generation, their static
semantic conditioning ignores temporal-frequency demands: early denoising
requires structural semantics for motion foundations while later stages need
localized details for text alignment. This mismatch mirrors biological
morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs.
Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we
propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture.
ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally
Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency
structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii)
Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts
conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining
fidelity. **(iii) Temporal-semantic reweighting:** Quantitatively aligns text
influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be
applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and
achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.

*Kunyu Wang,Xueyang Fu,Yunfei Bao,Chengjie Ge,Chengzhi Cao,Wei Zhai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAID方法通过保持预训练权重的成对角度结构，提出了一种简单有效的持续测试时间适应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用目标数据，而忽略了预训练权重中的领域不变先验信息。

Method: 分析预训练权重的几何属性（幅度、绝对角度、成对角度结构），提出PAID方法，分解权重为幅度和方向，并通过Householder反射学习正交矩阵以保持成对角度结构。

Result: PAID在四个CTTA基准测试中优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 保持成对角度结构是CTTA的简单有效原则。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained
model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on
exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of
information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized
domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of
pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key
components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find
that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted
domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should
be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID
(Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that
decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable
orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction
while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the
magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent
improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks,
demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet
effective principle for CTTA.

*Martin JJ. Bucher,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSpace是一种基于自回归语言模型的生成框架，用于文本驱动的3D室内场景合成与编辑，通过结构化场景表示和双阶段训练方法，实现了优于现有技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D室内场景合成与编辑中存在语义简化、编辑困难、忽略房间边界或依赖简单布局等问题，ReSpace旨在通过自然语言和结构化表示解决这些限制。

Method: ReSpace采用结构化场景表示和双阶段训练（监督微调与偏好对齐），支持对象添加、移除和场景编辑，并通过零样本LLM处理编辑任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，ReSpace在对象添加任务上超越现有技术，同时在完整场景合成中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: ReSpace通过结合语言模型和结构化表示，为3D场景合成与编辑提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer
graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify
object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'),
require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor
plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based
methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with
light wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to
rectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world
models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor
scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach
features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room
boundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We
leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and
preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object
addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object
semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a
zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further
introduce a novel voxelization-based evaluation that captures fine-grained
geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass
state-of-the-art on object addition while maintaining competitive results on
full scene synthesis.

Result: 在三个基准测试中，方法在减少12%计算开销的同时，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和适应性性能之间取得了平衡，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptive object detection (CTTA-OD) aims to online adapt
a source pre-trained detector to ever-changing environments during inference
under continuous domain shifts. Most existing CTTA-OD methods prioritize
effectiveness while overlooking computational efficiency, which is crucial for
resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD
method via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all
learned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature
channels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we
introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each
channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and
instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively
suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on
invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation
mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful
features and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on
three benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance
while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent
SOTA method.

Conclusion: HRTR在动作检测任务中优于现有方法，简化了流程并提升了性能。

Abstract: Stroke rehabilitation often demands precise tracking of patient movements to
monitor progress, with complexities of rehabilitation exercises presenting two
critical challenges: fine-grained and sub-second (under one-second) action
detection. In this work, we propose the High Resolution Temporal Transformer
(HRTR), to time-localize and classify high-resolution (fine-grained),
sub-second actions in a single-stage transformer, eliminating the need for
multi-stage methods and post-processing. Without any refinements, HRTR
outperforms state-of-the-art systems on both stroke related and general

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件去噪扩散模型的方法，通过短时物体运动视频生成形状和材质图，解决了单视角下的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过微小运动解决形状和材质感知的模糊性，启发研究者设计一种类似的方法。

Method: 使用条件去噪扩散模型，通过物体运动视频生成形状和材质图，直接在像素空间训练。

Result: 模型在静态观察下生成多模态预测，运动时快速收敛到更准确结果，并在真实物体上表现良好。

Conclusion: 通过连续运动观察，该方法为物理系统中的视觉推理提供了生成感知的新思路。

Abstract: Perceiving the shape and material of an object from a single image is
inherently ambiguous, especially when lighting is unknown and unconstrained.
Despite this, humans can often disentangle shape and material, and when they
are uncertain, they often move their head slightly or rotate the object to help
resolve the ambiguities. Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel
conditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of
shape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential
motions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in
pixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object
simultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos
with supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent
behavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions
of plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and
when objects move, the distributions quickly converge to more accurate
explanations. The model also produces high-quality shape-and-material estimates
for less ambiguous, real-world objects. By moving beyond single-view to
continuous motion observations, our work suggests a generative perception
approach for improving visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过动态扩展数据集和模仿人脑学习机制，提升图像去雨网络的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雨方法因数据集有限，在多样化真实场景中表现不佳，需提升网络的持续学习能力。

Method: 结合GANs捕获新数据特征，模拟海马体学习与记忆；通过知识蒸馏和重放数据，模仿新皮层与海马体的协同作用。

Result: 在六个数据集上验证了框架的有效性，性能超越现有方法，尤其在泛化新场景时表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架通过持续学习和知识积累，显著提升了去雨网络的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Current image de-raining methods primarily learn from a limited dataset,
leading to inadequate performance in varied real-world rainy conditions. To
tackle this, we introduce a new framework that enables networks to
progressively expand their de-raining knowledge base by tapping into a growing
pool of datasets, significantly boosting their adaptability. Drawing
inspiration from the human brain's ability to continuously absorb and
generalize from ongoing experiences, our approach borrow the mechanism of the
complementary learning system. Specifically, we first deploy Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture and retain the unique features of new
data, mirroring the hippocampus's role in learning and memory. Then, the
de-raining network is trained with both existing and GAN-synthesized data,
mimicking the process of hippocampal replay and interleaved learning.
Furthermore, we employ knowledge distillation with the replayed data to
replicate the synergy between the neocortex's activity patterns triggered by
hippocampal replays and the pre-existing neocortical knowledge. This
comprehensive framework empowers the de-raining network to amass knowledge from
various datasets, continually enhancing its performance on previously unseen
rainy scenes. Our testing on three benchmark de-raining networks confirms the
framework's effectiveness. It not only facilitates continuous knowledge
accumulation across six datasets but also surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
generalizing to new real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Flexiffusion是一种无需重新训练的高效NAS框架，通过动态分段优化生成计划和模型架构，显著降低计算成本，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）因多步迭代推理导致计算成本高，现有NAS方法受限于重新训练、搜索复杂性和缓慢评估。

Method: 将生成过程分解为灵活分段，动态组合完整计算、缓存重用和跳过计算三种步骤类型，并引入轻量级评估指标rFID。

Result: 在LDMs、Stable Diffusion和DDPMs上实现至少2倍加速，FID退化低于5%，Stable Diffusion上达到5.1倍加速且CLIP分数接近。

Conclusion: Flexiffusion为高效搜索高质量扩散模型提供了资源节约的新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing
high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to
iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can
optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements,
exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation
relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose
Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation
schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our
key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of
equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full
(complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped
computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool
exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural
diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation
metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead
of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice,
Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable
Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$,
outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$
speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers
a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督图像分割方法未能充分利用多源体素级不确定性进行针对性学习，因此需要改进。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，该方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过改进不确定性测量和优化目标设计，方法在医学图像分割中表现优异。

Abstract: Although existing semi-supervised image segmentation methods have achieved
good performance, they cannot effectively utilize multiple sources of
voxel-level uncertainty for targeted learning. Therefore, we propose two main
improvements. First, we introduce a novel pignistic co-evidential fusion
strategy using generalized evidential deep learning, extended by traditional
D-S evidence theory, to obtain a more precise uncertainty measure for each
voxel in medical samples. This assists the model in learning mixed labeled
information and establishing semantic associations between labeled and
unlabeled data. Second, we introduce the concept of information volume of mass
function (IVUM) to evaluate the constructed evidence, implementing two
evidential learning schemes. One optimizes evidential deep learning by
combining the information volume of the mass function with original uncertainty
measures. The other integrates the learning pattern based on the co-evidential
fusion strategy, using IVUM to design a new optimization objective. Experiments
on four datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.

Conclusion: ZeroPlane在3D平面重建的准确性和泛化能力上取得了显著进展，为跨领域应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D plane reconstruction from a single image is a crucial yet challenging
topic in 3D computer vision. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have
focused on training their system on a single dataset from either indoor or
outdoor domain, limiting their generalizability across diverse testing data. In
this work, we introduce a novel framework dubbed ZeroPlane, a Transformer-based
model targeting zero-shot 3D plane detection and reconstruction from a single
image, over diverse domains and environments. To enable data-driven models
across multiple domains, we have curated a large-scale planar benchmark,
comprising over 14 datasets and 560,000 high-resolution, dense planar
annotations for diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. To address the challenge of
achieving desirable planar geometry on multi-dataset training, we propose to
disentangle the representation of plane normal and offset, and employ an
exemplar-guided, classification-then-regression paradigm to learn plane and
offset respectively. Additionally, we employ advanced backbones as image
encoder, and present an effective pixel-geometry-enhanced plane embedding
module to further facilitate planar reconstruction. Extensive experiments
across multiple zero-shot evaluation datasets have demonstrated that our
approach significantly outperforms previous methods on both reconstruction
accuracy and generalizability, especially over in-the-wild data. Our code and
data are available at: https://github.com/jcliu0428/ZeroPlane.

Conclusion: LumosFlow框架显著提升了长视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread
applications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances,
synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains
a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by
sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames
and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However,
both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as
temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the
hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a
framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ
the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames
with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the
generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual
transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame
interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of
key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes
complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently
refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame
generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x
interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent
frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with
consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly
available upon acceptance. Our project page:

Abstract: Inspired by the in-context learning mechanism of large language models
(LLMs), a new paradigm of generalizable visual prompt-based image editing is
emerging. Existing single-reference methods typically focus on style or
appearance adjustments and struggle with non-rigid transformations. To address
these limitations, we propose leveraging source-target image pairs to extract
and transfer content-aware editing intent to novel query images. To this end,
we introduce RelationAdapter, a lightweight module that enables Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) based models to effectively capture and apply visual
transformations from minimal examples. We also introduce Relation252K, a
comprehensive dataset comprising 218 diverse editing tasks, to evaluate model
generalization and adaptability in visual prompt-driven scenarios. Experiments
on Relation252K show that RelationAdapter significantly improves the model's
ability to understand and transfer editing intent, leading to notable gains in
generation quality and overall editing performance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过利用不完美标签提升了模型的泛化性和性能，为大规模应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Monocular height estimation is considered the most efficient and
cost-effective means of 3D perception in remote sensing, and it has attracted
much attention since the emergence of deep learning. While training neural
networks requires a large amount of data, data with perfect labels are scarce
and only available within developed regions. The trained models therefore lack
generalizability, which limits the potential for large-scale application of
existing methods. We tackle this problem for the first time, by introducing
data with imperfect labels into training pixel-wise height estimation networks,
including labels that are incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate compared to
high-quality labels. We propose an ensemble-based pipeline compatible with any
monocular height estimation network. Taking the challenges of noisy labels,
domain shift, and long-tailed distribution of height values into consideration,
we carefully design the architecture and loss functions to leverage the
information concealed in imperfect labels using weak supervision through
balanced soft losses and ordinal constraints. We conduct extensive experiments
on two datasets with different resolutions, DFC23 (0.5 to 1 m) and GBH (3 m).
The results indicate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baselines by
achieving more balanced performance across various domains, leading to
improvements of average root mean square errors up to 22.94 %, and 18.62 % on
DFC23 and GBH, respectively. The efficacy of each design component is validated
through ablation studies. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了视频异常检测的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction
face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often
results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it
difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on
low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify
high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First,
to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering
Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively
remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules,
it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset.
Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each
expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during
running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the
diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of
semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint
modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce
modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion
frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public
datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework
and sparse feature filtering paradigm. Project page at

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly
advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual
Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in
perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the
bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their
abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR,
featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities
across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we
introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for
generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only
generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides
fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POLED提出了一种基于概率框架的事件下采样方法，通过事件重要性概率密度函数（ePDF）动态评估事件重要性，支持场景自适应和零采样下采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高时间分辨率带来高带宽和计算需求，现有固定启发式方法适应性不足。

Method: 提出POLED框架，利用ePDF动态评估事件重要性，支持在线估计和零采样下采样，设计了轮廓保留的ePDF。

Result: 在四个数据集和任务上验证，智能采样在事件预算限制下保持性能。

Conclusion: POLED通过动态重要性评估和零采样下采样，显著提升了事件下采样的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis,
enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at
the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this,
prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed
heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead,
we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance
through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be
arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach
operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly
from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain
usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific
adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally
important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object
classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object
detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining
performance under event-budget constraints.

Motivation: 手术智能领域缺乏针对性的基础模型，现有通用视觉语言模型无法满足手术视觉感知、时间分析和推理的需求。

Method: 构建SurgVLM-DB数据库，整合23个公共数据集，标准化标签并进行层次化视觉语言对齐；基于Qwen2.5-VL开发SurgVLM模型，并进行指令调优。

Conclusion: SurgVLM填补了手术智能领域基础模型的空白，为多任务手术智能提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved transformative success across biomedical
domains by enabling holistic understanding of multimodal data. However, their
application in surgery remains underexplored. Surgical intelligence presents
unique challenges - requiring surgical visual perception, temporal analysis,
and reasoning. Existing general-purpose vision-language models fail to address
these needs due to insufficient domain-specific supervision and the lack of a
large-scale high-quality surgical database. To bridge this gap, we propose
SurgVLM, one of the first large vision-language foundation models for surgical
intelligence, where this single universal model can tackle versatile surgical
tasks. To enable this, we construct a large-scale multimodal surgical database,
SurgVLM-DB, comprising over 1.81 million frames with 7.79 million
conversations, spanning more than 16 surgical types and 18 anatomical
structures. We unify and reorganize 23 public datasets across 10 surgical
tasks, followed by standardizing labels and doing hierarchical vision-language
alignment to facilitate comprehensive coverage of gradually finer-grained
surgical tasks, from visual perception, temporal analysis, to high-level
reasoning. Building upon this comprehensive dataset, we propose SurgVLM, which
is built upon Qwen2.5-VL, and undergoes instruction tuning to 10+ surgical
tasks. We further construct a surgical multimodal benchmark, SurgVLM-Bench, for
method evaluation. SurgVLM-Bench consists of 6 popular and widely-used datasets
in surgical domain, covering several crucial downstream tasks. Based on
SurgVLM-Bench, we evaluate the performance of our SurgVLM (3 SurgVLM variants:
SurgVLM-7B, SurgVLM-32B, and SurgVLM-72B), and conduct comprehensive
comparisons with 14 mainstream commercial VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash,
Qwen2.5-Max).

TL;DR: 提出一种基于核的方法，将CLIP的视觉表示与DINOv2对齐，提升感知能力并保持与文本嵌入的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在细粒度感知上的局限性影响了多模态大语言模型的性能，而DINOv2在捕捉图像细节方面表现优异。

Method: 采用核方法对齐CLIP和DINOv2的视觉表示，设计高效的随机优化目标。

Result: 对齐后的视觉编码器在零样本识别、细粒度空间推理和定位任务中表现显著提升，下游MLLM性能也增强。

Conclusion: 通过视觉表示对齐，CLIP的感知能力得到增强，同时保持与文本嵌入的兼容性，提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have achieved significant success in
aligning visual and textual representations, becoming essential components of
many multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo.
However, numerous studies have identified CLIP's limited fine-grained
perception as a critical drawback, leading to substantial failures in
downstream MLLMs. In contrast, vision-centric foundation models like DINOv2
demonstrate remarkable capabilities in capturing fine details from images. In
this work, we propose a novel kernel-based method to align CLIP's visual
representation with that of DINOv2, ensuring that the resulting embeddings
maintain compatibility with text embeddings while enhancing perceptual
capabilities. Our alignment objective is designed for efficient stochastic
optimization. Following this image-only alignment fine-tuning, the visual
encoder retains compatibility with the frozen text encoder and exhibits
significant improvements in zero-shot object recognition, fine-grained spatial
reasoning, and localization. By integrating the aligned visual encoder,
downstream MLLMs also demonstrate enhanced performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI) 是一种新框架，通过联合条件优化解决扩散模型中重建精度与编辑灵活性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成和编辑任务中表现出色，但现有反演方法在重建精度和编辑灵活性之间存在固有权衡。

Method: DCI 将反演过程建模为双条件固定点优化问题，联合源提示和参考图像指导反演，最小化潜在噪声差距和重建误差。

Result: 实验表明，DCI 在多个编辑任务中达到最先进性能，显著提升重建质量和编辑精度，同时在重建任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: DCI 通过双条件优化实现了更准确和可编辑的潜在表示，为反演过程提供了新理解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and
editing tasks. Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise
representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing,
and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer
from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing
flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both
semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In
this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework
that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the
inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a
dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent
noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design
anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to
more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new
understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks,
significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in
reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability
approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer编码器和对比三元组损失的短轨迹嵌入学习框架，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法计算复杂、缺乏可解释性和可控性的问题，为运动预测和自主导航提供高效且语义明确的轨迹表示。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器训练对比三元组损失，分析Cosine和FFT相似性度量对方向意图的捕捉能力。

Result: 在Argoverse 2数据集上，Cosine相似性目标在语义和方向聚类上表现更优，低维嵌入（如16维）在性能和计算开销间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了紧凑、语义明确且高效的轨迹表示，为实时系统中的运动预测提供了透明且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range
trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream
applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However,
prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or
latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability.
In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional
embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained
with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative
feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and
FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a
focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term
maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates
that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior
clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes,
outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that
compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g.,
16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance
between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead,
aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors
in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically
meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust
alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more
transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.

Motivation: 传统校准方法需要大量受控环境数据且无法补偿运动中的变换变化，BEVCALIB旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过提取和融合相机与LiDAR的BEV特征，引入特征选择器优化变换解码器，减少内存消耗并提升训练效率。

Result: 在KITTI和NuScenes数据集上，BEVCALIB在平移和旋转指标上分别平均提升47.08%/82.32%和78.17%/68.29%。

Conclusion: BEVCALIB在LiDAR-相机校准领域实现了新的SOTA，代码和演示结果已开源。

Abstract: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is fundamental to fusing multi-modal
perception in autonomous driving and robotic systems. Traditional calibration
methods require extensive data collection in controlled environments and cannot
compensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement. In
this paper, we propose the first model that uses bird's-eye view (BEV) features
to perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCALIB. To achieve
this, we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse
them into a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometric
information from the BEV feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to
filter the most important features in the transformation decoder, which reduces
memory consumption and enables efficient training. Extensive evaluations on
KITTI, NuScenes, and our own dataset demonstrate that BEVCALIB establishes a
new state of the art. Under various noise conditions, BEVCALIB outperforms the
best baseline in the literature by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI
dataset, and (78.17%, 68.29%) on NuScenes dataset, in terms of (translation,
rotation), respectively. In the open-source domain, it improves the best
reproducible baseline by one order of magnitude. Our code and demo results are

Abstract: Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention,
but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which
limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for
their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from
RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and
physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion
model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an
unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing
autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task
from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly
reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance
diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of
non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the
reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored
to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional
metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of
generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an
advancement in hyperspectral data generation.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在超分辨率任务中因多步采样导致速度慢，且生成图像语义对齐不足、感知质量不佳。

Conclusion: VPD-SR通过语义一致性和高频细节恢复，显著提升了超分辨率任务的感知质量和效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have been widely used in various visual generation
tasks, showing promising results in image super-resolution (SR), while
typically being limited by dozens or even hundreds of sampling steps. Although
existing methods aim to accelerate the inference speed of multi-step
diffusion-based SR methods through knowledge distillation, their generated
images exhibit insufficient semantic alignment with real images, resulting in
suboptimal perceptual quality reconstruction, specifically reflected in the
CLIPIQA score. These methods still have many challenges in perceptual quality
and semantic fidelity. Based on the challenges, we propose VPD-SR, a novel
visual perception diffusion distillation framework specifically designed for
SR, aiming to construct an effective and efficient one-step SR model.
Specifically, VPD-SR consists of two components: Explicit Semantic-aware
Supervision (ESS) and High-Frequency Perception (HFP) loss. Firstly, the ESS
leverages the powerful visual perceptual understanding capabilities of the CLIP
model to extract explicit semantic supervision, thereby enhancing semantic
consistency. Then, Considering that high-frequency information contributes to
the visual perception quality of images, in addition to the vanilla
distillation loss, the HFP loss guides the student model to restore the missing
high-frequency details in degraded images that are critical for enhancing
perceptual quality. Lastly, we expand VPD-SR in adversarial training manner to
further enhance the authenticity of the generated content. Extensive
experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed VPD-SR achieves superior performance compared to both previous
state-of-the-art methods and the teacher model with just one-step sampling.

Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted
more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for
real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly
based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the
complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep

accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris,
enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train
and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset

simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562
frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset.
Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station,
achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability
to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Result: 在自定义数据集上表现优异，与GPT-4o竞争，同时显著降低推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效捕捉关键驾驶元素，适合实时部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a hierarchical question-answering (QA) approach for
scene understanding in autonomous vehicles, balancing cost-efficiency with
detailed visual interpretation. The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language
model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the
vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the
inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene
understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of
generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree,
where answering high-level questions (e.g., "Is it possible for the ego vehicle
to turn left at the intersection?") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g.,
"Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite
direction?"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped
based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted
answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent,
contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on
the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its
competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key
scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover,
qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's
capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.

Abstract: This paper proposes ControlMambaIR, a novel image restoration method designed
to address perceptual challenges in image deraining, deblurring, and denoising
tasks. By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model,
the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing
the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the

degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several
benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods

comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments
reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better
performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly
well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models,
outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context.
Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of
ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual

costs and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation
granularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation.
To address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel
adapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to
enable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen
pre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based
interpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These
predictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs
through efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational
costs without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate
catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a
gradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which
dynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for
stable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two
scenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's
effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决跨域少样本分割（CD-FSS）中特征纠缠问题的方法，通过分解ViT结构并学习权重来优化特征比较，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CD-FSS方法在特征比较中存在纠缠问题，导致源域模式难以迁移。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分解ViT结构并学习权重来优化特征比较，从而学习解耦特征并重新组合。

Result: 实验结果显示，新方法在1-shot和5-shot设置下平均准确率分别提高了1.92%和1.88%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了特征纠缠问题，提升了跨域少样本分割的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a
source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited
annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training
and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement
problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain
patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim
to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural
decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the
entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT
components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where
the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their
equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this
interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by
learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn
disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both
the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms
the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under
1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

TL;DR: FLAIR是一种基于流的生成模型框架，用于解决逆成像问题，通过变分目标和确定性轨迹调整提升重建质量和样本多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于流的生成模型（如Stable Diffusion 3）在图像生成上表现出色，但其作为逆问题先验时仍面临非线性映射、数据似然难解和罕见模式恢复困难等挑战。

Method: FLAIR提出了一种无需训练的变分框架，结合流匹配的变分目标和确定性轨迹调整，并分离数据保真度和正则化项的优化。

Result: 在标准成像基准测试中，FLAIR在重建质量和样本多样性上均优于现有基于扩散和流的方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过创新的变分框架和校准机制，显著提升了基于流生成模型在逆问题中的性能。

Abstract: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to
generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic
text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these
models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but
that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key
obstacles: (i) the encoding into a lower-dimensional latent space makes the
underlying (forward) mapping non-linear; (ii) the data likelihood term is
usually intractable; and (iii) learned generative models struggle to recover
rare, atypical data modes during inference. We present FLAIR, a novel training
free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as a
prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective
for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it
with deterministic trajectory adjustments to recover atypical modes. To enforce
exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the
data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent
calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated
according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging
benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion-
and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) represents a critical frontier in artificial
intelligence, with profound applications in education, computer-aided design,
and computational graphics. Despite its significance, automating GPS remains
challenging due to the dual demands of spatial understanding and rigorous
logical reasoning. Recent advances in large models have enabled notable
breakthroughs, particularly for SAT-level problems, yet the field remains
fragmented across methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks. This
survey systematically synthesizes GPS advancements through three core
dimensions: (1) benchmark construction, (2) textual and diagrammatic parsing,
and (3) reasoning paradigms. We further propose a unified analytical paradigm,
assess current limitations, and identify emerging opportunities to guide future
research toward human-level geometric reasoning, including automated benchmark
generation and interpretable neuro-symbolic integration.

Motivation: 现有AI方法缺乏显式的时间建模，导致无法捕捉动态手术场景，限制了时空理解的完整性。

Method: 构建了大规模手术视频数据集（3,650个视频，355万帧），提出SurgVISTA框架，通过重建预训练和专家指导的知识蒸馏实现联合时空建模。

Result: SurgVISTA在13个视频级数据集上表现优于自然和手术领域的预训练模型。

Conclusion: SurgVISTA在临床场景中具有推动智能手术系统发展的潜力。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize
modern surgery, with surgical scene understanding serving as a critical
component in supporting decision-making, improving procedural efficacy, and
ensuring intraoperative safety. While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate
annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their
lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts
the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete
spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level
surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal
representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this,
we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and
approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures
and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose
SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a
reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial
structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling.
Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided
by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical
and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a
comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six
surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain
pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent
surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.

TL;DR: FaceSleuth是一种双流架构，通过垂直注意力增强微表情识别，结合SOA模块进一步优化方向，在多个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别需要放大毫秒级、低幅度的面部运动，同时抑制身份特征。

Method: 采用双流架构，包括垂直注意力块（CVA）、面部位置聚焦器和动作单元嵌入，并引入可学习的SOA模块优化方向。

Result: 在CASME II、SAMM和MMEW上分别达到95.1%、87.1%和92.9%的准确率，F1分数也显著提升。

Conclusion: FaceSleuth证明了垂直注意力偏置是微表情识别中最具判别性的方向，并实现了新的SOTA性能。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) demands models that can amplify
millisecond-level, low-amplitude facial motions while suppressing
identity-specific appearance. We introduce FaceSleuth, a dual-stream
architecture that (1) enhances motion along the empirically dominant vertical
axix through a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block, (2) localises the
resulting signals with a Facial Position Focalizer built on hierarchical
cross-window attention, and (3) steers feature learning toward physiologically
meaningful regions via lightweight Action-Unit embeddings. To examine whether
the hand-chosen vertical axis is indeed optimal, we further propose a
Single-Orientation Attention (SOA) module that learns its own pooling direction
end-to-end. SOA is differentiable, adds only 0.16 % parameters, and collapses
to CVA when the learned angle converges to {\Pi}/2. In practice, SOA reliably
drifts to 88{\deg}, confirming the effectiveness of the vertical prior while
delivering consistent gains. On three standard MER benchmarks, FaceSleuth with
CVA already surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods; plugging in SOA lifts
accuracy and F1 score performance to 95.1 % / 0.918 on CASME II, 87.1 % / 0.840
on SAMM, and 92.9 % / 0.917 on MMEW without sacrificing model compactness.
These results establish a new state of the art and, for the first time, provide
empirical evidence that the vertical attention bias is the most discriminative
orientation for MER.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能生成高质量且符合给定条件的布局，优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过检索和参考引导，有效提升了布局生成的质量和条件符合性。

Abstract: Controllable layout generation aims to create plausible visual arrangements
of element bounding boxes within a graphic design according to certain optional
constraints, such as the type or position of a specific component. While recent
diffusion or flow-matching models have achieved considerable advances in
multifarious conditional generation tasks, there remains considerable room for
generating optimal arrangements under given conditions. In this work, we
propose to carry out layout generation through retrieving by conditions and
reference-guided generation. Specifically, we retrieve appropriate layout
templates according to given conditions as references. The references are then
utilized to guide the denoising or flow-based transport process. By retrieving
layouts compatible with the given conditions, we can uncover the potential
information not explicitly provided in the given condition. Such an approach
offers more effective guidance to the model during the generation process, in
contrast to previous models that feed the condition to the model and let the
model infer the unprovided layout attributes directly. Meanwhile, we design a
condition-modulated attention that selectively absorbs retrieval knowledge,
adapting to the difference between retrieved templates and given conditions.
Extensive experiment results show that our method successfully produces
high-quality layouts that meet the given conditions and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: SmPO-Diffusion提出了一种改进DPO目标的方法，通过建模偏好分布和优化扩散目标，解决了现有方法中偏好多样性和目标对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了偏好的个体差异，导致优化不准确。

Method: 引入平滑偏好分布和奖励模型，结合偏好似然平均和改进的DPO损失，利用反转技术模拟扩散模型的轨迹偏好分布。

Result: SmPO-Diffusion在偏好评估中表现最优，训练成本更低。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单修改有效解决了过度优化和目标对齐问题。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns text-to-image (T2I) generation
models with human preferences using pairwise preference data. Although
substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a
critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals
and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose
SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve
the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the
diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference
distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward
model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging
to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when
preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to
simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model,
enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective. Our approach
effectively mitigates issues of excessive optimization and objective
misalignment present in existing methods through straightforward modifications.
Our SmPO-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in preference
evaluation, outperforming baselines across metrics with lower training costs.

Motivation: 牙科形状数据集稀疏，传统方法对网格连通性有严格要求，限制了应用范围。ToothForge旨在解决这些问题，提供更灵活的建模方式。

Method: 在频谱域中对齐所有数据样本的频谱，消除分解不稳定性带来的偏差。通过同步频率嵌入建模，摆脱了对固定连通性的依赖。

Result: 在真实牙冠数据集上，生成的形状重建质量优于未对齐嵌入的模型。同时支持形状压缩和插值等应用。

Conclusion: ToothForge结合频谱分析和机器学习，适用于牙科及其他医学领域，突破了网格结构的限制。

Abstract: We introduce ToothForge, a spectral approach for automatically generating
novel 3D teeth, effectively addressing the sparsity of dental shape datasets.
By operating in the spectral domain, our method enables compact machine
learning modeling, allowing the generation of high-resolution tooth meshes in
milliseconds. However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of
the decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent
manifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples
are aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively
eliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore,
synchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods,
which require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private
dataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of
the synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned
embeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in
digital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge
facilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and
machine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it
applicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader
medical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes
from various clinics is unrealistic. The code is available at

Abstract: Image scoring is a crucial task in numerous real-world applications. To trust
a model's judgment, understanding its rationale is essential. This paper
proposes a novel training method for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to generate
not only image scores but also corresponding justifications in natural
language. Leveraging only an image scoring dataset and an instruction-tuned
VLM, our method enables self-training, utilizing the VLM's generated text
without relying on external data or models. In addition, we introduce a simple
method for creating a dataset designed to improve alignment between predicted
scores and their textual justifications. By iteratively training the model with
Direct Preference Optimization on two distinct datasets and merging them, we
can improve both scoring accuracy and the coherence of generated explanations.

Conclusion: GeneA-SLAM2为动态场景SLAM提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing semantic SLAM in dynamic environments mainly identify dynamic
regions through object detection or semantic segmentation methods. However, in
certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks
cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and
efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to
handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance
and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects.
Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the
genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed
keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated
on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2
maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods. Code is

Abstract: Compound figures, which are multi-panel composites containing diverse

Result: 新方法显著节省存储空间，提升渲染质量和跟踪精度，在广泛使用的基准测试中表现优于最新方法。

Conclusion: 视图绑定的3D高斯表示和优化策略有效解决了SLAM系统在大场景中的可扩展性和效率问题。

Abstract: Jointly estimating camera poses and mapping scenes from RGBD images is a
fundamental task in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
State-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render
these Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering.
However, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the
inefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D
Gaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the
geometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this
issue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D
representation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied
3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels,
without needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances.
Tying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows
us to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU
memory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians
learnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and
tracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report
better performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in
terms of rendering and tracking accuracy and scalability. Please see our

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，RobustSplat优于现有方法，渲染质量显著提升。

Conclusion: RobustSplat通过创新设计有效解决了瞬态物体场景的渲染问题，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its
real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by
transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify
that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture,
unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians
that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a
robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed
Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure
before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient
objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask
bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity
supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of
its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses
to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method
outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and
effectiveness of our method. Our project page is

Motivation: 探索自由观看和任务驱动的视觉搜索是否存在共同的注意力表示，以验证是否可以通过一个模型同时处理两种场景。

Method: 提出基于Human Attention Transformer (HAT)的神经网络架构，测试自由观看和视觉搜索的共享表示假设。

Result: 模型在自由观看训练后迁移到视觉搜索任务时，性能仅下降3.86%（SemSS指标），计算成本分别降低92.29%（GFLOPs）和31.23%（可训练参数）。

Conclusion: 自由观看和视觉搜索可以共享一个共同的注意力表示，实现高效知识迁移和计算成本优化。

Abstract: Computational human attention modeling in free-viewing and task-specific
settings is often studied separately, with limited exploration of whether a
common representation exists between them. This work investigates this question
and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention
transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that
free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation,
allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to
task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the
predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS)
metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths.
This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and
31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.

Result: 实验表明DTNet在车辆检测中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: DTNet通过动态权重和注意力机制提升了车辆检测的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Stable consumer electronic systems can assist traffic better. Good traffic
consumer electronic systems require collaborative work between traffic
algorithms and hardware. However, performance of popular traffic algorithms
containing vehicle detection methods based on deep networks via learning data
relation rather than learning differences in different lighting and occlusions
is limited. In this paper, we present a dynamic Transformer network for vehicle
detection (DTNet). DTNet utilizes a dynamic convolution to guide a deep network
to dynamically generate weights to enhance adaptability of an obtained
detector. Taking into relations of different information account, a mixed
attention mechanism based channel attention and Transformer is exploited to
strengthen relations of channels and pixels to extract more salient information
for vehicle detection. To overcome the drawback of difference in an image
account, a translation-variant convolution relies on spatial location
information to refine obtained structural information for vehicle detection.
Experimental results illustrate that our DTNet is competitive for vehicle
detection. Code of the proposed DTNet can be obtained at

Conclusion: FreeScene统一了文本和图控制，提供了高效且用户友好的场景合成解决方案。

Abstract: Controllability plays a crucial role in the practical applications of 3D
indoor scene synthesis. Existing works either allow rough language-based
control, that is convenient but lacks fine-grained scene customization, or
employ graph based control, which offers better controllability but demands
considerable knowledge for the cumbersome graph design process. To address
these challenges, we present FreeScene, a user-friendly framework that enables
both convenient and effective control for indoor scene synthesis.Specifically,
FreeScene supports free-form user inputs including text description and/or
reference images, allowing users to express versatile design intentions. The
user inputs are adequately analyzed and integrated into a graph representation
by a VLM-based Graph Designer. We then propose MG-DiT, a Mixed Graph Diffusion
Transformer, which performs graph-aware denoising to enhance scene generation.
Our MG-DiT not only excels at preserving graph structure but also offers broad
applicability to various tasks, including, but not limited to, text-to-scene,
graph-to-scene, and rearrangement, all within a single model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FreeScene provides an efficient and user-friendly
solution that unifies text-based and graph based scene synthesis, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both generation quality and
controllability in a range of applications.

Abstract: Objective. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is recognized as a biomarker
of secondary brain injury, with a significant linear correlation observed
between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP. Frequent monitoring of ONSD
could effectively support dynamic evaluation of ICP. However, ONSD measurement
is heavily reliant on the operator's experience and skill, particularly in
manually selecting the optimal frame from ultrasound sequences and measuring
ONSD. Approach. This paper presents a novel method to automatically identify
the optimal frame from video sequences for ONSD measurement by employing the
Kernel Correlation Filter (KCF) tracking algorithm and Simple Linear Iterative
Clustering (SLIC) segmentation algorithm. The optic nerve sheath is mapped and
measured using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a
KL-divergence-based method. Results. When compared with the average
measurements of two expert clinicians, the proposed method achieved a mean
error, mean squared deviation, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of
0.04, 0.054, and 0.782, respectively. Significance. The findings suggest that
this method provides highly accurate automated ONSD measurements, showing
potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to transfer knowledge from a
data-sufficient source domain to data-scarce target domains. Although Vision
Transformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its
transferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In
this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain
training, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the
generalization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises
(i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance.
We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that
learnable prompts capture domain information during the training on the source
dataset, which views irrelevant visual patterns as vital cues for recognition.
This can be viewed as a kind of overfitting and increases the sharpness of the
loss landscapes. In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of
perturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the
model find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the
transferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further
propose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation
on attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image
tokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and
state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models are available at

Conclusion: PBR-SR方法在无需额外训练的情况下，显著提升了PBR纹理的超分辨率效果，适用于艺术设计和AI生成网格。

Abstract: We present PBR-SR, a novel method for physically based rendering (PBR)
texture super resolution (SR). It outputs high-resolution, high-quality PBR
textures from low-resolution (LR) PBR input in a zero-shot manner. PBR-SR
leverages an off-the-shelf super-resolution model trained on natural images,
and iteratively minimizes the deviations between super-resolution priors and
differentiable renderings. These enhancements are then back-projected into the
PBR map space in a differentiable manner to produce refined, high-resolution
textures. To mitigate view inconsistencies and lighting sensitivity, which is
common in view-based super-resolution, our method applies 2D prior constraints
across multi-view renderings, iteratively refining the shared, upscaled
textures. In parallel, we incorporate identity constraints directly in the PBR
texture domain to ensure the upscaled textures remain faithful to the LR input.
PBR-SR operates without any additional training or data requirements, relying
entirely on pretrained image priors. We demonstrate that our approach produces
high-fidelity PBR textures for both artist-designed and AI-generated meshes,
outperforming both direct SR models application and prior texture optimization
methods. Our results show high-quality outputs in both PBR and rendering
evaluations, supporting advanced applications such as relighting.

Result: 实验表明，METok在多种视频基准测试中实现了效率与准确性的最佳平衡，显著减少计算和内存消耗。

Conclusion: METok为VLLMs提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，适用于长视频处理。

Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly
enhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing
long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the
redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a
training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to
accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively
eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1)
event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning
in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and
(3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory
consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok
achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically
selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with
METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all
while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.

Conclusion: PGFormer通过金字塔结构有效捕捉长距离依赖关系，为3D人体姿态估计提供了轻量且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial
constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is
represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two
main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not
only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the
body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies
between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the
model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn
potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints
and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an
effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range
dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA)
module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates
information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the
correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution
modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose
estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It
encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size
than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code
is available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.

Conclusion: 抽象提示比位置提示蕴含更丰富的语义信息，增强了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural
image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its
applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable.
Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle
to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM
(HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong
performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous
self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to
vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the
self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework
achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and
skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical
imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen
datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art
methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract
prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared
to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and
generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become a critical challenge in Computer Vision and
Artificial Intelligence. Despite significant progress in detection techniques,
generalizing them to open-set scenarios continues to be a persistent
difficulty. Neural networks are often trained on the closed-world assumption,
but with new generative models constantly evolving, it is inevitable to
encounter data generated by models that are not part of the training
distribution. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose two novel
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection approaches. The first approach is trained
to reconstruct the input image, while the second incorporates an attention
mechanism for detecting OODs. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our
method achieves promising results in deepfake detection and ranks among the
top-performing configurations on the benchmark, demonstrating their potential
for robust, adaptable solutions in dynamic, real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task with widespread
applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and maritime robotics.
Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments
continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections,
low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent
occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific
datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking
Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically
designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences,
totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object
classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset
captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios,
reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated
14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed
substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on
general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models
demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of
domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized
tracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking
community by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime
scenarios. Dataset and Source Code can be accessed here

Abstract: Accurate mapping of permafrost landforms, thaw disturbances, and human-built
infrastructure at pan-Arctic scale using sub-meter satellite imagery is
increasingly critical. Handling petabyte-scale image data requires
high-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely
used for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large
language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing
long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs
support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common
limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on
benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization,
especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral
characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we
integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across
regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as
feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the
benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published
datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three
tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and
human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to
fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with
location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks
including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating
the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS
applications.

### [163] [GaRA-SAM: Robustifying Segment Anything Model with Gated-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02882)
*Sohyun Lee,Yeho Kwon,Lukas Hoyer,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GaRA的轻量级适配器方法，用于提升Segment Anything Model (SAM)在输入退化情况下的鲁棒性，并在多个基准测试中显著优于先前工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升SAM在输入退化情况下的鲁棒性，以支持其在自动驾驶和机器人等高风险应用中的部署。

Method: 提出gated-rank adaptation (GaRA)，通过在SAM的中间层引入轻量级适配器，动态调整权重矩阵的有效秩，实现细粒度和输入感知的鲁棒化。

Result: GaRA-SAM在所有鲁棒分割基准测试中显著优于先前工作，特别是在ACDC数据集上，IoU得分比之前最佳结果提高了21.3%。

Conclusion: GaRA方法在不牺牲SAM泛化能力的前提下，有效提升了其鲁棒性，适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: Improving robustness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to input
degradations is critical for its deployment in high-stakes applications such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Our approach to this challenge prioritizes
three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent
generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware
robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence
to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose
gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into
intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts
the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively
activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module.
This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without
compromising the generalization capability of SAM. Our model, GaRA-SAM,
significantly outperforms prior work on all robust segmentation benchmarks. In
particular, it surpasses the previous best IoU score by up to 21.3\%p on ACDC,
a challenging real corrupted image dataset.

### [165] [Dense Match Summarization for Faster Two-view Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02893)
*Jonathan Astermark,Anders Heyden,Viktor Larsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的匹配总结方案，显著加速了基于密集匹配的两视图相对位姿估计，同时保持了与完整密集匹配相当的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集匹配虽然提高了位姿估计的精度和鲁棒性，但增加了RANSAC中的运行时间。

Method: 提出了一种高效的匹配总结方案，减少匹配数量但保持精度。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上验证，运行时间快10-100倍，精度与完整密集匹配相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we speed up robust two-view relative pose from dense
correspondences. Previous work has shown that dense matchers can significantly
improve both accuracy and robustness in the resulting pose. However, the large
number of matches comes with a significantly increased runtime during robust
estimation in RANSAC. To avoid this, we propose an efficient match
summarization scheme which provides comparable accuracy to using the full set
of dense matches, while having 10-100x faster runtime. We validate our approach
on standard benchmark datasets together with multiple state-of-the-art dense
matchers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂、非结构化环境中的表现，发现其无法可靠完成任务，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在真实、复杂环境中的表现，填补其在主动探索任务中的能力空白。

Method: 引入FlySearch，一个3D户外逼真环境，定义三种难度场景，评估VLMs表现，并分析失败原因。

Result: 现有VLMs无法可靠完成任务，与人类表现差距随任务难度增加而扩大；部分问题可通过微调解决。

Conclusion: VLMs在复杂探索任务中存在显著局限性，需进一步改进；公开了基准和代码。

Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information
often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot
tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In
this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor,
photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex
scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe
that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration
tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We
identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through
context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of
them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark,
scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

### [167] [Towards Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines: A Benchmark through 3D LiDAR Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02914)
*Yechi Ma,Wei Hua,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出新基准AnnoGuide，通过专家定义的标注指南自动标注数据，减少人工标注需求，并在nuScenes数据集上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注是机器学习应用中的关键但繁琐且昂贵的步骤，研究旨在通过自动化方法直接从标注指南生成标注，减少人工干预。

Method: 采用开源基础模型（FMs）进行RGB图像目标检测与分割，将2D检测结果投影到3D空间，并通过聚类LiDAR点生成3D边界框。

Result: 方法显著提升了3D检测性能，mAP从12.1提升至21.9，但仍显示AnnoGuide是一个开放且具挑战性的问题。

Conclusion: AnnoGuide为自动化数据标注提供了新方向，但需进一步开发LiDAR基础模型以解决现有挑战。

Abstract: A crucial yet under-appreciated prerequisite in machine learning solutions
for real-applications is data annotation: human annotators are hired to
manually label data according to detailed, expert-crafted guidelines. This is
often a laborious, tedious, and costly process. To study methods for
facilitating data annotation, we introduce a new benchmark AnnoGuide:
Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines. It aims to evaluate automated
methods for data annotation directly from expert-defined annotation guidelines,
eliminating the need for manual labeling. As a case study, we repurpose the
well-established nuScenes dataset, commonly used in autonomous driving
research, which provides comprehensive annotation guidelines for labeling LiDAR
point clouds with 3D cuboids across 18 object classes. These guidelines include
a few visual examples and textual descriptions, but no labeled 3D cuboids in
LiDAR data, making this a novel task of multi-modal few-shot 3D detection
without 3D annotations. The advances of powerful foundation models (FMs) make
AnnoGuide especially timely, as FMs offer promising tools to tackle its
challenges. We employ a conceptually straightforward pipeline that (1) utilizes
open-source FMs for object detection and segmentation in RGB images, (2)
projects 2D detections into 3D using known camera poses, and (3) clusters LiDAR
points within the frustum of each 2D detection to generate a 3D cuboid.
Starting with a non-learned solution that leverages off-the-shelf FMs, we
progressively refine key components and achieve significant performance
improvements, boosting 3D detection mAP from 12.1 to 21.9! Nevertheless, our
results highlight that AnnoGuide remains an open and challenging problem,
underscoring the urgent need for developing LiDAR-based FMs. We release our
code and models at GitHub: https://annoguide.github.io/annoguide3Dbenchmark

### [168] [MIND: Material Interface Generation from UDFs for Non-Manifold Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02938)
*Xuhui Chen,Fei Hou,Wencheng Wang,Hong Qin,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIND算法直接从无符号距离场（UDFs）生成材料界面，支持非流形网格提取，解决了现有方法在拓扑结构和非流形几何上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法从UDFs提取网格时存在拓扑伪影和非流形几何无法表示的问题，MIND旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过从UDFs推导空间分区，构建多标签全局场，结合UDFs生成材料界面，支持多标签Marching Cubes算法提取非流形网格。

Result: 实验表明，MIND能鲁棒处理复杂非流形表面，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MIND为从UDFs提取非流形网格提供了一种全局视角的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) are widely used in 3D deep learning due to
their ability to represent shapes with arbitrary topology. While prior work has
largely focused on learning UDFs from point clouds or multi-view images,
extracting meshes from UDFs remains challenging, as the learned fields rarely
attain exact zero distances. A common workaround is to reconstruct signed
distance fields (SDFs) locally from UDFs to enable surface extraction via
Marching Cubes. However, this often introduces topological artifacts such as
holes or spurious components. Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of
representing non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases.
To address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold
Distance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly
from UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The
core of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the
UDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct
regions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two
sides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field
capable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this
multi-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that
support non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes
algorithm. Extensive experiments on UDFs generated from diverse data sources,
including point cloud reconstruction, multi-view reconstruction, and medial
axis transforms, demonstrate that our approach robustly handles complex
non-manifold surfaces and significantly outperforms existing methods.

*Guiqiu Liao,Matjaz Jogan,Eric Eaton,Daniel A. Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FORLA是一个联邦学习框架，通过无监督槽注意力学习跨客户端的对象中心表示和特征适应，优于集中式基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构无标签数据集中高效视觉表示的联邦学习挑战，需要跨客户端联合信息特征并解耦领域特定因素。

Method: 使用共享特征适配器和槽注意力模块，设计双分支师生架构，优化适配器并跨客户端对齐对象级表示。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，FORLA在对象发现任务中优于集中式基线，并学习到紧凑、通用的跨域表示。

Conclusion: 联邦槽注意力是分布式概念跨域数据中可扩展无监督视觉表示学习的有效工具。

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled
datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated
representations require features that are jointly informative across clients
while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce
FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning
and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the
core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across
clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention
module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this
adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a
student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models,
while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional
counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by
aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple
real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized
baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal
representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights
federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual
representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

generation have made significant strides, with model architectures evolving
from separated components to unified single-model frameworks. This paper
explores an efficient training paradigm to build a single transformer for
unified multimodal understanding and generation. Specifically, we propose a

and multimodal AdaLN techniques. Integrating the proposed technologies, we
present the HaploOmni, a new single multimodal transformer. With limited
training costs, HaploOmni achieves competitive performance across multiple
image and video understanding and generation benchmarks over advanced unified
models. All codes will be made public at https://github.com/Tencent/HaploVLM.

Motivation: 推动AMD的自动化监测技术发展，评估AI在AMD检测和预测中的表现。

Method: 使用多模态数据集（主数据集来自法国Brest，辅助数据集来自阿尔及利亚），设计了两项任务：分类连续OCT B扫描的演变和预测未来三个月AMD的进展。

Result: AI在AMD进展测量（任务1）上与医生表现相当，但在预测未来进展（任务2）上仍有不足。

Conclusion: MARIO挑战赛为AMD监测设定了基准，展示了AI在部分任务中的潜力，但也揭示了其在预测任务中的局限性。

Abstract: The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated
detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the
analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate
algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD,
the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset,
sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test
their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this
dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate
population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved
in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution
between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of
future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with
the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the
challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies,
setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and
clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of
this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a
physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of
predicting future evolution (Task 2).

Conclusion: AstroDiff是一种有效的天文图像湍流修复方法，尤其在严重湍流条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Photography is the cornerstone of modern astronomical and space research.
However, most astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes suffer
from atmospheric turbulence, resulting in degraded imaging quality. While
multi-frame strategies like lucky imaging can mitigate some effects, they
involve intensive data acquisition and complex manual processing. In this
paper, we propose AstroDiff, a generative restoration method that leverages
both the high-quality generative priors and restoration capabilities of
diffusion models to mitigate atmospheric turbulence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AstroDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art learning-based
methods in astronomical image turbulence mitigation, providing higher
perceptual quality and better structural fidelity under severe turbulence
conditions. Our code and additional results are available at

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, the realism of AI-generated
images has significantly improved, posing critical challenges for verifying
digital content authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods often depend
on datasets with limited generation models and content diversity that fail to
keep pace with the evolving complexity and increasing realism of the
AI-generated content. Large multimodal models (LMMs), widely adopted in various
vision tasks, have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities, yet their
potential in deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap,
we present \textbf{DFBench}, a large-scale DeepFake Benchmark featuring (i)
broad diversity, including 540,000 images across real, AI-edited, and
AI-generated content, (ii) latest model, the fake images are generated by 12
state-of-the-art generation models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and
evaluating for both the detection accuracy of deepfake detectors and the
evasion capability of generative models. Based on DFBench, we propose
\textbf{MoA-DF}, Mixture of Agents for DeepFake detection, leveraging a
combined probability strategy from multiple LMMs. MoA-DF achieves
state-of-the-art performance, further proving the effectiveness of leveraging
LMMs for deepfake detection. Database and codes are publicly available at

Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video
generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant
inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video
Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns:
diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\%
attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong
layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the
input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity
acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels
that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for
each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search
algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and
head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal
configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same
attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into
state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1),
Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical
FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$,
and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with
PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent
structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video
synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved
significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic
images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying
the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant
potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and
watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme
to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though
challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning
models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable
prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a
prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models,
which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning
model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and
converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on
the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our
method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual
alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate
the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image
synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and
unsupervised segmentation.

Conclusion: LEG-SLAM在实时语义3D SLAM中表现优异，适用于机器人、AR等领域。

Abstract: Modern Gaussian Splatting methods have proven highly effective for real-time
photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, integrating semantic
information into this representation remains a significant challenge,
especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM --
a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with
visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature
compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online
dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic
images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene
reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on
ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive
rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data
preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps.
With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and
other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in
real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM. Project page:

Conclusion: ORV通过占用表示实现了仿真数据到逼真机器人视频的高质量转换，具有高时间一致性和精确可控性。

Abstract: Acquiring real-world robotic simulation data through teleoperation is
notoriously time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently, action-driven
generative models have gained widespread adoption in robot learning and
simulation, as they eliminate safety concerns and reduce maintenance efforts.
However, the action sequences used in these methods often result in limited
control precision and poor generalization due to their globally coarse
alignment. To address these limitations, we propose ORV, an Occupancy-centric
Robot Video generation framework, which utilizes 4D semantic occupancy
sequences as a fine-grained representation to provide more accurate semantic
and geometric guidance for video generation. By leveraging occupancy-based
representations, ORV enables seamless translation of simulation data into
photorealistic robot videos, while ensuring high temporal consistency and
precise controllability. Furthermore, our framework supports the simultaneous
generation of multi-view videos of robot gripping operations - an important
capability for downstream robotic learning tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that ORV consistently outperforms existing baseline methods
across various datasets and sub-tasks. Demo, Code and Model:

Conclusion: SG2VID为手术模拟提供了高真实感和可控性，适用于罕见手术场景的生成。

Abstract: Surgical simulation plays a pivotal role in training novice surgeons,
accelerating their learning curve and reducing intra-operative errors. However,
conventional simulation tools fall short in providing the necessary
photorealism and the variability of human anatomy. In response, current methods
are shifting towards generative model-based simulators. Yet, these approaches
primarily focus on using increasingly complex conditioning for precise
synthesis while neglecting the fine-grained human control aspect. To address
this gap, we introduce SG2VID, the first diffusion-based video model that
leverages Scene Graphs for both precise video synthesis and fine-grained human
control. We demonstrate SG2VID's capabilities across three public datasets
featuring cataract and cholecystectomy surgery. While SG2VID outperforms
previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, it also enables precise
synthesis, providing accurate control over tool and anatomy's size and
movement, entrance of new tools, as well as the overall scene layout. We
qualitatively motivate how SG2VID can be used for generative augmentation and
present an experiment demonstrating its ability to improve a downstream phase
detection task when the training set is extended with our synthetic videos.
Finally, to showcase SG2VID's ability to retain human control, we interact with
the Scene Graphs to generate new video samples depicting major yet rare
intra-operative irregularities.

Abstract: Human-human interaction generation has garnered significant attention in
motion synthesis due to its vital role in understanding humans as social
beings. However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based
architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and
efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human
interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet
the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing
real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal
Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive
mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences.
To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within
individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual
sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba
module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient
feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality
and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only
improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only
36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds,
which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.

Conclusion: EVNets展示了架构改进与数据增强的互补优势，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve
high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of
visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological
vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a
front-end block (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1)
can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early
Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock
with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational
models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with
subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without
being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the
VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better
modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit
stronger emergent shape bias and overperform the base CNN architecture by 8.5%
on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial
perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that
EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data
augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data
augmentation approach by 7.3% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals
complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology
and training-based machine learning approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 现有对比语言-图像预训练方法无法原生处理多模态输入，需额外模块融合特征。FuseLIP旨在通过早期融合提升多模态交互和表示能力。

Method: 利用离散图像标记器，扩展词汇表为文本和图像标记，使用单一Transformer模型进行编码，实现早期融合。

Result: FuseLIP在多模态任务（如VQA和文本引导图像转换检索）中优于其他方法，在单模态任务中与基线相当。

Conclusion: FuseLIP通过早期融合架构提升了多模态表示能力，为多模态预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image
pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While
this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it
cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a
single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional
modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work,
we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding.
Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a
single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and
image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to
interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared
to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and
evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show
that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as
VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to
baselines on unimodal tasks.

Abstract: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous
agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video
streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to
integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric
video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with
human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly
tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought
(CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering
benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves
performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on
non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by
14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By
explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability,
making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide
reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising
avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object contacts is essential for realistic
manipulation in AI character animation, XR, and robotics, yet it remains
challenging due to heavy occlusions, complex surface details, and limitations
in existing capture techniques. In this paper, we introduce DyTact, a
markerless capture method for accurately capturing dynamic contact in
hand-object manipulations in a non-intrusive manner. Our approach leverages a
dynamic, articulated representation based on 2D Gaussian surfels to model
complex manipulations. By binding these surfels to MANO meshes, DyTact
harnesses the inductive bias of template models to stabilize and accelerate
optimization. A refinement module addresses time-dependent high-frequency
deformations, while a contact-guided adaptive sampling strategy selectively
increases surfel density in contact regions to handle heavy occlusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyTact not only achieves
state-of-the-art dynamic contact estimation accuracy but also significantly
improves novel view synthesis quality, all while operating with fast
optimization and efficient memory usage. Project Page:

Conclusion: 图像token连续性对ViT泛化能力有重要影响，破坏连续性可提升跨域少样本学习性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success due to its
large-scale pretraining on general domains, but it still faces challenges when
applying it to downstream distant domains that have only scarce training data,
which gives rise to the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) task. Inspired
by Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting
phenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image
tokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads
to a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a
marginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of
image tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In
this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find
continuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to
transfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances. Meanwhile, it implies
that only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme
domain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet
effective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens,
encouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain
gaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works. Codes and models are available

Abstract: Large-scale delineation of individual trees from remote sensing imagery is
crucial to the advancement of ecological research, particularly as climate
change and other environmental factors rapidly transform forest landscapes
across the world. Current RGB tree segmentation methods rely on training
specialized machine learning models with labeled tree datasets. While these
learning-based approaches can outperform manual data collection when accurate,
the existing models still depend on training data that's hard to scale. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art image
segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in a zero-shot manner for
individual tree detection and segmentation. We evaluate a pretrained SAM2 model
on two tasks in this domain: (1) zero-shot segmentation and (2) zero-shot
transfer by using predictions from an existing tree detection model as prompts.
Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization
capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods
trained on in-domain labeled data. We find that applying large pretrained
models to problems in remote sensing is a promising avenue for future progress.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了细粒度遗忘问题，无需预训练数据，且保持模型性能，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot
performance across various tasks by leveraging large-scale, unsupervised
pre-training. However, they often inherit harmful or unwanted knowledge from
noisy internet-sourced datasets, compromising their reliability in real-world
applications. Existing model unlearning methods either rely on access to
pre-trained datasets or focus on coarse-grained unlearning (e.g., entire
classes), leaving a critical gap for fine-grained unlearning. In this paper, we
address the challenging scenario of selectively forgetting specific portions of
knowledge within a class, without access to pre-trained data, while preserving
the model's overall performance. We propose a novel three-stage approach that
progressively unlearns targeted knowledge while mitigating over-forgetting. It
consists of (1) a forgetting stage to fine-tune the CLIP on samples to be
forgotten, (2) a reminding stage to restore performance on retained samples,
and (3) a restoring stage to recover zero-shot capabilities using model
souping. Additionally, we introduce knowledge distillation to handle the
distribution disparity between forgetting, retaining samples, and unseen
pre-trained data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and style
datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively unlearns specific subgroups
while maintaining strong zero-shot performance on semantically similar
subgroups and other categories, significantly outperforming baseline unlearning
methods, which lose effectiveness under the CLIP unlearning setting.

Motivation: 现有插值方法缺乏3D几何引导，难以处理复杂人体动作且控制性有限。

Method: 提出PoseFuse3D-KI框架，结合3D人体信号（SMPL-X编码器）和2D姿态嵌入，通过融合网络生成插值。

Result: 在CHKI-Video数据集上，PSNR提升9%，LPIPS降低38%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseFuse3D-KI通过3D引导显著提升了插值质量和控制性，适用于复杂人体动作。

Abstract: Existing interpolation methods use pre-trained video diffusion priors to
generate intermediate frames between sparsely sampled keyframes. In the absence
of 3D geometric guidance, these methods struggle to produce plausible results
for complex, articulated human motions and offer limited control over the
synthesized dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PoseFuse3D Keyframe
Interpolator (PoseFuse3D-KI), a novel framework that integrates 3D human
guidance signals into the diffusion process for Controllable Human-centric
Keyframe Interpolation (CHKI). To provide rich spatial and structural cues for
interpolation, our PoseFuse3D, a 3D-informed control model, features a novel
SMPL-X encoder that transforms 3D geometry and shape into the 2D latent
conditioning space, alongside a fusion network that integrates these 3D cues
with 2D pose embeddings. For evaluation, we build CHKI-Video, a new dataset
annotated with both 2D poses and 3D SMPL-X parameters. We show that
PoseFuse3D-KI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
CHKI-Video, achieving a 9% improvement in PSNR and a 38% reduction in LPIPS.
Comprehensive ablations demonstrate that our PoseFuse3D model improves
interpolation fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双专家一致性模型（DCM），通过语义专家和细节专家的分工，解决了视频扩散模型蒸馏中的梯度冲突问题，显著提升了时间一致性和细节质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视频合成中表现优异，但计算开销大。一致性模型虽能加速，但直接应用于视频会导致时间一致性和细节退化。研究发现梯度冲突是主要原因。

Method: 提出DCM模型，包含语义专家和细节专家，分别优化语义布局与运动、细节细化。引入时间相干损失和GAN/特征匹配损失以提升效果。

Result: DCM在显著减少采样步数的同时，达到了最先进的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 专家分工策略有效解决了视频扩散模型蒸馏中的问题，提升了时间一致性和细节质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable results in video synthesis but
require iterative denoising steps, leading to substantial computational
overhead. Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating
diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models
often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance
details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency
Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation
process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and
loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the
distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised
temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we
propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)},
where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a
detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce
Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert
and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the
detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with
significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert
specialization in video diffusion model distillation. Our code and models are

TL;DR: AnimeShooter是一个参考引导的多镜头动画数据集，填补了现有数据集的不足，通过自动化流程提供层次化注释和视觉一致性，并展示了其在连贯动画生成中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集缺乏角色参考图像和连贯的多镜头视频生成能力，限制了AI生成内容在动画制作中的应用。

Method: 提出AnimeShooter数据集，包含故事级和镜头级注释，以及同步音频子集；并开发AnimeShooterGen模型，结合MLLM和视频扩散模型生成连贯视频。

Result: 实验表明，基于AnimeShooter训练的模型在多镜头视觉一致性和参考视觉引导方面表现优异。

Conclusion: AnimeShooter为连贯动画视频生成提供了有价值的资源，并展示了其在多镜头视频生成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated
animation production. To produce engaging animations, it is essential to
generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character
references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world
scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent
character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a
reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features
comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across
shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an
overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main
character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations
decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene,
characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a
dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each
shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided
multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The
reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to
produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then
used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot.
Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves
superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual
guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video
generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种原生分辨率图像合成方法，克服了传统固定分辨率方法的限制，支持任意分辨率和宽高比的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定分辨率的图像生成方法无法灵活处理不同分辨率和宽高比的图像，限制了生成模型的实用性。

Method: 提出了Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT)，通过显式建模不同分辨率和宽高比的视觉标记，实现灵活的图像生成。

Result: NiT在ImageNet-256x256和512x512基准测试中达到最先进性能，并展示了出色的零样本泛化能力，支持高分辨率和多样宽高比的图像生成。

Conclusion: 原生分辨率建模在视觉生成模型与高级语言模型方法之间具有重要潜力。

Abstract: We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling
paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and
aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional
fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length
visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we
introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture
designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its
denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns
intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of
resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512
benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in
advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates
excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates
high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536)
and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These
findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a
bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基础空间关系理解上表现有限，缺乏对复杂空间推理的评估，因此提出了OmniSpatial基准。

Method: 通过互联网数据爬取和人工标注构建了1.5K问答对，涵盖动态推理、复杂空间逻辑、空间交互和视角转换四大类。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在综合空间理解上表现不佳，存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: OmniSpatial为未来研究提供了方向，揭示了模型在复杂空间推理上的不足。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major
bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research
has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial
relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object
counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial
reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology.
OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial
logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained
subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we
construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both
open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial
understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial
understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential
directions for future research.

Method: SVGenius基于24个应用领域的真实数据，通过8个任务类别和18个指标评估模型，涵盖不同规模、架构和训练范式的22个模型。

Result: 专有模型显著优于开源模型，但所有模型在复杂度增加时性能下降；推理增强训练比单纯扩展更有效，风格迁移仍是最具挑战性的能力。

Conclusion: SVGenius为SVG处理建立了首个系统评估框架，为开发更强大的向量图形模型和自动化图形设计应用提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising
capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited
real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented
evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding,
editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains
with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8
task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning
different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels.
Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform
open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation
with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current
approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than
pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains
the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes
the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial
insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing
automated graphic design applications. Appendix and supplementary materials

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式相机参数序列，用户操作繁琐，尤其是复杂相机运动。

Method: 提出CamCloneMaster框架，利用参考视频复制相机运动，无需相机参数或微调，并构建Camera Clone数据集。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，CamCloneMaster在相机可控性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CamCloneMaster提供了一种更直观的相机控制方法，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Camera control is crucial for generating expressive and cinematic videos.
Existing methods rely on explicit sequences of camera parameters as control
conditions, which can be cumbersome for users to construct, particularly for
intricate camera movements. To provide a more intuitive camera control method,
we propose CamCloneMaster, a framework that enables users to replicate camera
movements from reference videos without requiring camera parameters or
test-time fine-tuning. CamCloneMaster seamlessly supports reference-based
camera control for both Image-to-Video and Video-to-Video tasks within a
unified framework. Furthermore, we present the Camera Clone Dataset, a
large-scale synthetic dataset designed for camera clone learning, encompassing
diverse scenes, subjects, and camera movements. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that CamCloneMaster outperforms existing methods in terms
of both camera controllability and visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Context-as-Memory的方法，通过利用历史上下文作为记忆来提升长视频生成的场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成长视频时因历史上下文利用不足而缺乏场景一致性记忆能力。

Method: 设计了Context-as-Memory，包括直接存储上下文帧和通过帧维度拼接上下文与预测帧的方法，并引入Memory Retrieval模块以减少计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在长视频生成中表现出卓越的记忆能力，并能泛化到未训练过的开放域场景。

Conclusion: Context-as-Memory在交互式长视频生成中优于现有技术，且计算高效。

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results,
yet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in
long video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work,
we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for
video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing
context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by
concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at
the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the
enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we
propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by
determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which
significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial
information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves
superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to
SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during
training. The link of our project page is https://context-as-memory.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UniWorld的统一生成框架，基于强大的视觉语言模型和对比语义编码器提供的语义特征，显著提升了图像编辑性能，同时保持了图像理解和生成的竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一模型在视觉语言理解和文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在图像感知和操作任务上存在局限，用户对此有广泛需求。

Method: 通过观察GPT-4o-Image的表现，推断其使用语义编码器而非VAE提取特征，并基于此设计了UniWorld框架。

Result: UniWorld仅使用1%的BAGEL数据，便在图像编辑基准上超越BAGEL，同时在图像理解和生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: UniWorld是一个高效且强大的统一模型，支持图像感知、操作和生成，并已完全开源。

Abstract: Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on
vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are
limited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are
urgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released
their powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and
manipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community
interests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully
constructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features
extracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered
essential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such
inspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named
UniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models
and contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model
using only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on
image editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image
understanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across
multiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including
model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets.

Motivation: 解决不同视觉模态（如RGB与深度图）间像素对应问题，避免显式光一致性假设。

Method: 扩展对比随机游走框架，学习跨模态和模态内匹配的循环一致特征表示。

Result: 在RGB-深度、RGB-热成像、照片-素描和跨风格图像对齐任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 方法简单有效，无需标注数据，适用于多种跨模态匹配任务。

Abstract: We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given
two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth
map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical
points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random
walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations
for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple
and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely
using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal
image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic
correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks
such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic
matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our
method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.

Motivation: 探索对称性在数学结构和优化问题中的作用，特别是在神经网络之外的更广泛空间中。

Result: 所有观察到的临界点均具有非平凡对称性，并揭示了新的对称性结构。

Conclusion: 对称性在更广泛空间中普遍存在，新度量能揭示更多对称性结构。

Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of mathematical
structures and optimization problems. Recent work has explored this phenomenon
in the context of neural networks, where the loss function is invariant under
column and row permutations of the network weights. It has been observed that
local minima exhibit significant symmetry with respect to the network weights
(invariance to row and column permutations). And moreover no critical point was
found that lacked symmetry. We extend this line of inquiry by investigating
symmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions defined on a broader class of
spaces. We will introduce four more cases: the projective case over a finite
field, the octahedral graph case, the perfect matching case, and the particle
attraction case. We show that as in the neural network case, all the critical
points observed have non-trivial symmetry. Finally we introduce a new measure
of symmetry in the system and show that it reveals additional symmetry
structures not captured by the previous measure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在跨用户泛化上表现不佳，主要由于用户行为、传感器放置和数据分布的差异。

Method: GNN-ADG通过构建三种解剖单元（互联单元、类比单元和侧向单元）的图结构，并结合对抗学习，动态融合空间、功能和区域相关性。

Result: 该方法能够在不依赖目标用户数据的情况下，学习到用户无关的特征表示，实现跨用户泛化。

Conclusion: GNN-ADG为传感器基人类活动识别提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-user variability poses a significant challenge in sensor-based Human
Activity Recognition (HAR) systems, as traditional models struggle to
generalize across users due to differences in behavior, sensor placement, and
data distribution. To address this, we propose GNN-ADG (Graph Neural Network
with Adversarial Domain Generalization), a novel method that leverages both the
strength from both the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and adversarial learning to
achieve robust cross-user generalization. GNN-ADG models spatial relationships
between sensors on different anatomical body parts, extracting three types of
Anatomical Units: (1) Interconnected Units, capturing inter-relations between
neighboring sensors; (2) Analogous Units, grouping sensors on symmetrical or
functionally similar body parts; and (3) Lateral Units, connecting sensors
based on their position to capture region-specific coordination. These units
information are fused into an unified graph structure with a cyclic training
strategy, dynamically integrating spatial, functional, and lateral correlations
to facilitate a holistic, user-invariant representation. Information fusion
mechanism of GNN-ADG occurs by iteratively cycling through edge topologies
during training, allowing the model to refine its understanding of inter-sensor
relationships across diverse perspectives. By representing the spatial
configuration of sensors as an unified graph and incorporating adversarial
learning, Information Fusion GNN-ADG effectively learns features that
generalize well to unseen users without requiring target user data during
training, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present a novel non attention based architecture for large language models
(LLMs) that efficiently handles very long context windows, on the order of
hundreds of thousands to potentially millions of tokens. Unlike traditional
Transformer designs, which suffer from quadratic memory and computation
overload due to the nature of the self attention mechanism, our model avoids
token to token attention entirely. Instead, it combines the following
complementary components: State Space blocks (inspired by S4) that learn
continuous time convolution kernels and scale near linearly with sequence
length, Multi Resolution Convolution layers that capture local context at
different dilation levels, a lightweight Recurrent Supervisor to maintain a
global hidden state across sequential chunks, and Retrieval Augmented External
Memory that stores and retrieves high-level chunk embeddings without

Conclusion: 研究表明，整合多样化数据和先进算法能为交通模型带来显著改进，为城市规划者和政策制定者提供更可靠的预测和决策工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of trips between zones is critical for transportation
planning, as it supports resource allocation and infrastructure development
across various modes of transport. Although the gravity model has been widely
used due to its simplicity, it often inadequately represents the complex
factors influencing modern travel behavior. This study introduces a data-driven
approach to enhance the gravity model by integrating geographical, economic,
social, and travel data from the counties in Tennessee and New York state.
Using machine learning techniques, we extend the capabilities of the
traditional model to handle more complex interactions between variables. Our
experiments demonstrate that machine learning-enhanced models significantly
outperform the traditional model. Our results show a 51.48% improvement in
R-squared, indicating a substantial enhancement in the model's explanatory
power. Also, a 63.59% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reflects a
significant increase in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a 44.32% increase in
Common Part of Commuters (CPC) demonstrates improved prediction reliability.
These findings highlight the substantial benefits of integrating diverse
datasets and advanced algorithms into transportation models. They provide urban
planners and policymakers with more reliable forecasting and decision-making
tools.

Conclusion: TaskVAE在内存限制、任务特定生成和长期稳定性之间取得了平衡，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning based systems become more integrated into daily life,
they unlock new opportunities but face the challenge of adapting to dynamic
data environments. Various forms of data shift-gradual, abrupt, or
cyclic-threaten model accuracy, making continual adaptation essential.
Continual Learning (CL) enables models to learn from evolving data streams
while minimizing forgetting of prior knowledge. Among CL strategies,
replay-based methods have proven effective, but their success relies on
balancing memory constraints and retaining old class accuracy while learning
new classes. This paper presents TaskVAE, a framework for replay-based CL in
class-incremental settings. TaskVAE employs task-specific Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, which
are then used to train the classifier alongside new task data. In contrast to
traditional methods that require prior knowledge of the total class count or
rely on a single VAE for all tasks, TaskVAE adapts flexibly to increasing tasks
without such constraints. We focus on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using
IMU sensor-equipped devices. Unlike previous HAR studies that combine data
across all users, our approach focuses on individual user data, better
reflecting real-world scenarios where a person progressively learns new
activities. Extensive experiments on 5 different HAR datasets show that TaskVAE
outperforms experience replay methods, particularly with limited data, and
exhibits robust performance as dataset size increases. Additionally, memory
footprint of TaskVAE is minimal, being equivalent to only 60 samples per task,
while still being able to generate an unlimited number of synthetic samples.
The contributions lie in balancing memory constraints, task-specific
generation, and long-term stability, making it a reliable solution for
real-world applications in domains like HAR.

Abstract: Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential
and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying
commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts
convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix
multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix
performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a
lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally
as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with
standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical
evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet),
time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language
modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that
sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while
converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to
sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism
and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a
mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens
avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.

Abstract: Quantization effectively reduces the serving costs of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by speeding up data movement through compressed parameters and enabling
faster operations via integer arithmetic. However, activating integer
arithmetic requires quantizing both weights and activations, which poses
challenges due to the significant outliers in LLMs that increase quantization
error. In this work, we investigate these outliers with an emphasis on their
effect on layer-wise quantization error, then examine how smoothing and
rotation transform the observed values. Our primary contributions include
introducing a new metric to measure and visualize quantization difficulty based
on channel magnitudes, as well as proposing a hybrid approach that applies
channel-wise scaling before rotation, supported by a mathematical formulation
of its benefits.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance
in numerous tasks, but deployment in resource-constrained environments remains
a challenge due to their high computational and memory requirements. Spiking
neural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior
energy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current
ANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased
inference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and
uneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework
based on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold
clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential
initialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these
techniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically
reduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the
non-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential.
Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our
method achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion
methods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the
inference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75% on CIFAR-10
dataset under ResNet-18 structure. This research promotes the practical
application of SNNs on low-power hardware, making efficient real-time
processing possible.

Conclusion: 新方法为提升AI抽象推理能力提供了创新方案。

Abstract: This paper thoroughly investigates the challenges of enhancing AI's abstract
reasoning capabilities, with a particular focus on Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) tasks involving complex human-like concepts. Firstly, it dissects the
empirical reality that traditional end-to-end RPM-solving models heavily rely
on option pool configurations, highlighting that this dependency constrains the
model's reasoning capabilities. To address this limitation, the paper proposes
the Johnny architecture - a novel representation space-based framework for
RPM-solving. Through the synergistic operation of its Representation Extraction
Module and Reasoning Module, Johnny significantly enhances reasoning
performance by supplementing primitive negative option configurations with a
learned representation space. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capacity
for capturing positional relationships among local features, the paper
introduces the Spin-Transformer network architecture, accompanied by a
lightweight Straw Spin-Transformer variant that reduces computational overhead
through parameter sharing and attention mechanism optimization. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that both Johnny and Spin-Transformer achieve superior
performance on RPM tasks, offering innovative methodologies for advancing AI's
abstract reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically
meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as
road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning,
development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However,
traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human
experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to
confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning
approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode
critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference,
enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses
concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs
to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract
interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in
regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis
testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient
significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously
overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental
evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full
interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose
framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from
unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental
outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications
and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable
knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.

Result: Bob的成功与任务相关性密切相关；即使任务无关，预训练网络和优化器选择仍能带来显著提升。

Conclusion: 任务语义相关性是模型复用的关键，低相关性时复用底层网络更优。

Abstract: Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine
learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of
her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great
effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an
experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical
success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might
just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation
between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and
input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly
better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer.
When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained
layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number
of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we
show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's
pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's
task.

Abstract: Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify
agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental
aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when
these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles
indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a
lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to
evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety
principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting
lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes
the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of
LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers
preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and
discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing
controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles
is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI
systems.

Result: Fusion DeepONet在非断裂情况下表现更优，但在涉及位移和裂纹演化的断裂驱动场景中仍有挑战。

Conclusion: Fusion DeepONet在复杂几何和时间依赖的裂纹传播现象中展现出泛化潜力。

Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in
engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and
cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such
as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent
developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on
constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation
and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use
data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train
operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets),
which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional
vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for
predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying
geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height
without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and
hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The
models are trained on 32 to 45 samples, using geometric inputs in the branch
network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show
that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more
accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven
scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging.
These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across
complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.

Abstract: This study critically examines the methodological rigor in credit card fraud
detection research, revealing how fundamental evaluation flaws can overshadow
algorithmic sophistication. Through deliberate experimentation with improper
evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that even simple models can achieve
deceptively impressive results when basic methodological principles are
violated. Our analysis identifies four critical issues plaguing current
approaches: (1) pervasive data leakage from improper preprocessing sequences,
(2) intentional vagueness in methodological reporting, (3) inadequate temporal
validation for transaction data, and (4) metric manipulation through recall
optimization at precision's expense. We present a case study showing how a
minimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many
sophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\% recall despite
fundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation
methodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research. The
study serves as a cautionary example of how methodological rigor must precede
architectural sophistication, with implications for improving research
practices across machine learning applications.

Conclusion: GEDRanker为GED计算提供了一种高效且无需真实标签的新方法。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely
used in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem.
Recent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by
formulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a
generative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from
which both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a
traditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on
ground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth labels are often costly to
obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker, a novel
unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically, GEDRanker
consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an interpretable
preference-aware discriminator with an effective training strategy to guide the
matching-based GED solver toward generating high-quality node matching without
the need for ground-truth labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based GED solver to achieve
near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth supervision.

Conclusion: SpecMemo为资源受限环境下的LLM应用提供了高效部署方案，实现了更快、更经济的实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speculative decoding have demonstrated considerable
speedup across a wide array of large language model (LLM) tasks. Speculative
decoding inherently relies on sacrificing extra memory allocations to generate
several candidate tokens, of which acceptance rate drives the speedup. However,
deploying speculative decoding on memory-constrained devices, such as mobile
GPUs, remains as a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. In this work,
we present a device-aware inference engine named SpecMemo that can smartly
control memory allocations at finer levels to enable multi-turn chatbots with
speculative decoding on such limited memory devices. Our methodology stems from
theoretically modeling memory footprint of speculative decoding to determine a
lower bound on the required memory budget while retaining speedup. SpecMemo
empirically acquires a careful balance between minimizing redundant memory
allocations for rejected candidate tokens and maintaining competitive
performance gains from speculation. Notably, with SpecMemo's memory management,
we maintain 96% of overall throughput from speculative decoding on MT-Bench,
with reduced generation-memory by 65% on single Nvidia Titan RTX. Given
multiple constrained GPUs, we build on top of previous speculative decoding
architectures to facilitate big-model inference by distributing
Llama-2-70B-Chat model, on which we provide novel batched speculative decoding
to increase usability of multiple small server GPUs. This novel framework
demonstrates 2x speedup over distributed and batched vanilla decoding with the
base model on eight AMD MI250 GPUs. Moreover, inference throughput increases
remarkably 8x with batch size 10. Our work contributes to democratized LLM
applications in resource-constrained environments, providing a pathway for
faster and cheaper deployment of real-world LLM applications with robust
performance.

Abstract: Data inherently possesses dual attributes: samples and targets. For targets,
knowledge distillation has been widely employed to accelerate model
convergence, primarily relying on teacher-generated soft target supervision.
Conversely, recent advancements in data-efficient learning have emphasized
sample optimization techniques, such as dataset distillation, while neglected
the critical role of target. This dichotomy motivates our investigation into
understanding how both sample and target collectively influence training
dynamic. To address this gap, we first establish a taxonomy of existing
paradigms through the lens of sample-target interactions, categorizing them
into distinct sample-to-target mapping strategies. Building upon this
foundation, we then propose a novel unified loss framework to assess their
impact on training efficiency. Through extensive empirical studies on our
proposed strategies, we comprehensively analyze how variations in target and
sample types, quantities, and qualities influence model training, providing six
key insights to enhance training efficacy.

Abstract: The field of health informatics has been profoundly influenced by the
development of random forest models, which have led to significant advances in
the interpretability of feature interactions. These models are characterized by
their robustness to overfitting and parallelization, making them particularly
useful in this domain. However, the increasing number of features and
estimators in random forests can prevent domain experts from accurately
interpreting global feature interactions, thereby compromising trust and
regulatory compliance. A method called the surrogate interpretability graph has
been developed to address this issue. It uses graphs and mixed-integer linear
programming to analyze and visualize feature interactions. This improves their
interpretability by visualizing the feature usage per
decision-feature-interaction table and the most dominant hierarchical decision
feature interactions for predictions. The implementation of a surrogate
interpretable graph enhances global interpretability, which is critical for
such a high-stakes domain.

Motivation: 现有分布式学习方法在面对拜占庭攻击时，由于设备间梯度差异较大，导致鲁棒聚合规则（RBA）效果不佳，学习性能下降。

Method: 在训练前冗余分配数据，训练中诚实设备传输编码梯度，服务器使用RBA规则聚合信息，近似恢复全局梯度以更新模型。

Conclusion: CRA-DL通过编码梯度缩小差异，显著提升了对抗拜占庭攻击的能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributed learning (DL) in the
presence of Byzantine attacks. For this problem, various robust bounded
aggregation (RBA) rules have been proposed at the central server to mitigate
the impact of Byzantine attacks. However, current DL methods apply RBA rules
for the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information
from Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly
when the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each
other. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with
Byzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training
begins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During
training, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the
server computed from the allocated training data, and the server then
aggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices
using RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately
recovered at the server to update the global model. Compared with current DL
methods applying RBA rules, the improvement of CRA-DL is attributed to the fact
that the coded gradients sent by the honest devices are closer to each other.
This closeness enhances the robustness of the aggregation against Byzantine
attacks, since Byzantine messages tend to be significantly different from those
of honest devices in this case. We theoretically analyze the convergence

Result: 在离散网格环境中，DcHRL-SA在探索效率、收敛速度、累积奖励和策略稳定性上优于PPO。

Conclusion: DcHRL-SA为大规模离散状态空间的探索提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Effective agent exploration remains a core challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL) for complex discrete state-space environments, particularly under
partial observability. This paper presents a decoupled hierarchical RL
framework integrating state abstraction (DcHRL-SA) to address this issue. The
proposed method employs a dual-level architecture, consisting of a high level
RL-based actor and a low-level rule-based policy, to promote effective
exploration. Additionally, state abstraction method is incorporated to cluster
discrete states, effectively lowering state dimensionality. Experiments
conducted in two discrete customized grid environments demonstrate that the
proposed approach consistently outperforms PPO in terms of exploration
efficiency, convergence speed, cumulative reward, and policy stability. These
results demonstrate a practical approach for integrating decoupled hierarchical
policies and state abstraction in discrete grids with large-scale exploration
space. Code will be available at https://github.com/XQY169/DcHRL-SA.

Abstract: Ensemble clustering has demonstrated great success in practice; however, its
theoretical foundations remain underexplored. This paper examines the
generalization performance of ensemble clustering, focusing on generalization
error, excess risk and consistency. We derive a convergence rate of
generalization error bound and excess risk bound both of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{m}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, with $n$ and $m$
being the numbers of samples and base clusterings. Based on this, we prove that
when $m$ and $n$ approach infinity and $m$ is significantly larger than log
$n$, i.e., $m,n\to \infty, m\gg \log n$, ensemble clustering is consistent.
Furthermore, recognizing that $n$ and $m$ are finite in practice, the
generalization error cannot be reduced to zero. Thus, by assigning varying
weights to finite clusterings, we minimize the error between the empirical
average clusterings and their expectation. From this, we theoretically
demonstrate that to achieve better clustering performance, we should minimize
the deviation (bias) of base clustering from its expectation and maximize the
differences (diversity) among various base clusterings. Additionally, we derive
that maximizing diversity is nearly equivalent to a robust (min-max)
optimization model. Finally, we instantiate our theory to develop a new
ensemble clustering algorithm. Compared with SOTA methods, our approach
achieves average improvements of 6.1%, 7.3%, and 6.0% on 10 datasets w.r.t.
NMI, ARI, and Purity. The code is available at https://github.com/xuz2019/GPEC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索指纹模式与血型之间的潜在关联，以简化个人身份识别方法。

Method: 分析200人的指纹（分为环、涡、弓）和血型，使用卡方检验和Pearson相关性分析。

Result: 环是最常见的指纹模式，O+是最常见的血型，但两者无显著相关性（p > 0.05）。

Conclusion: 研究未发现显著相关性，但建议未来扩大样本、结合机器学习，以完善身份识别方法。

Abstract: Introduction: Personal identification is a critical aspect of forensic
sciences, security, and healthcare. While conventional biometrics systems such
as DNA profiling and iris scanning offer high accuracy, they are time-consuming
and costly. Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between
fingerprint patterns and ABO blood group classification to explore potential
correlations between these two traits. Methods: The study analyzed 200
individuals, categorizing their fingerprints into three types: loops, whorls,
and arches. Blood group classification was also recorded. Statistical analysis,
including chi-square and Pearson correlation tests, was used to assess
associations between fingerprint patterns and blood groups. Results: Loops were
the most common fingerprint pattern, while blood group O+ was the most
prevalent among the participants. Statistical analysis revealed no significant
correlation between fingerprint patterns and blood groups (p > 0.05),
suggesting that these traits are independent. Conclusions: Although the study
showed limited correlation between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood groups,
it highlights the importance of future research using larger and more diverse
populations, incorporating machine learning approaches, and integrating
multiple biometric signals. This study contributes to forensic science by
emphasizing the need for rigorous protocols and comprehensive investigations in
personal identification.

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of
human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general
intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards
achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context
switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic
forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned
task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task
contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the
interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper
introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context
switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an
additional network that generates the weights of the primary network
dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is
input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer
vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of
previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks,
Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient
Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding
dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in
enabling continual learning for improved performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ODLRI的方法，通过结构化分解权重矩阵为量化和低秩两部分，以更好地平衡两者，提升模型压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联合优化量化和低秩近似时，往往偏重一方而忽略另一方，导致分解效果不佳。

Method: 引入Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI)，让低秩部分专门捕获激活敏感的权重，从而减轻异常值对量化的负面影响。

Result: 实验表明，ODLRI能有效减少激活感知误差、降低量化尺度，并在低比特设置下提升困惑度和零样本准确率。

Conclusion: ODLRI通过结构化分解优化了权重矩阵的压缩效果，为大型语言模型的高效压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Decomposing weight matrices into quantization and low-rank components
($\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$) is a widely used
technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing joint
optimization methods iteratively alternate between quantization and low-rank
approximation. However, these methods tend to prioritize one component at the
expense of the other, resulting in suboptimal decompositions that fail to
leverage each component's unique strengths. In this work, we introduce
Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI), which assigns low-rank
components the specific role of capturing activation-sensitive weights. This
structured decomposition mitigates outliers' negative impact on quantization,
enabling more effective balance between quantization and low-rank
approximation. Experiments on Llama2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Llama3-8B, and Mistral-7B
demonstrate that incorporating ODLRI into the joint optimization framework
consistently reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and
improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy in low-bit settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MaskedOptim的两阶段优化框架，用于解决联邦学习中的复杂标签噪声问题，通过检测噪声客户端和标签校正机制提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中不同客户端的标签噪声问题严重影响模型性能，需要开发有效的优化策略。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段检测高噪声率客户端，第二阶段通过端到端标签校正机制修正噪声标签，并使用几何中位数模型聚合增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架在不同场景下表现鲁棒，并有效提升了噪声客户端的数据质量。

Conclusion: MaskedOptim框架能有效缓解联邦学习中的标签噪声问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in
privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL
participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding
annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying
levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of
the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely
attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an
effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy
clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework,
MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is
designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise
rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients'
data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the
negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by
learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via
backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the
geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla
averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct
evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label
noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results
indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different
scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances
the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes
will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities. Our codes are

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型在不同领域和任务中表现不一，且无法自然利用示例或指令进行测试时适应。

Method: 提出RATFM，通过检索增强机制使预训练模型能够结合测试时适应的示例。

Result: RATFM在UCR Anomaly Archive多领域数据集上表现优异，性能接近领域内微调。

Conclusion: RATFM有效解决了时间序列基础模型在测试时适应中的局限性，无需领域依赖的微调。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation
models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and
anomaly detection. However, their performances vary between different domains
and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based
prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the
context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing
normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time
series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or
utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used
during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this
limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model
(RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate
examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance
comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent
fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset
including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为TCS的框架，用于生成真实的时间序列数据及其因果图，通过三个阶段实现，并展示了其灵活性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法依赖合成数据，但模拟数据质量不足，尤其在时间序列数据中更明显。TCS旨在生成更真实的时态因果数据。

Method: TCS分为三个阶段：估计数据的滞后因果结构、近似变量间的函数依赖关系、学习因果模型的噪声分布。此外，还引入了Min-max优化阶段。

Result: 实验表明，TCS能生成更真实的时态因果数据，并通过多数据集验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TCS为生成真实的时态因果数据提供了灵活且模型无关的解决方案，并揭示了数据生成中的挑战。

Abstract: Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among
observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of
CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training,
these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even
more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified
assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and
diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal
Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic
time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is
structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the
data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning
the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which
can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics.
Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection
methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as
a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that
draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible,
model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a
thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets
and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through
experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely
synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data
remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible
causal-based temporal data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative capabilities for hardware

pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data
contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of
malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment
that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach
enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and
design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without
requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how
machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in
LLM-aided hardware design.

Abstract: To increase the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, it is critical to
improve the understanding of how they make decisions. This paper introduces a
novel unsupervised concept-based model for image classification, named
Learnable Concept-Based Model (LCBM) which models concepts as random variables
within a Bernoulli latent space. Unlike traditional methods that either require
extensive human supervision or suffer from limited scalability, our approach
employs a reduced number of concepts without sacrificing performance. We
demonstrate that LCBM surpasses existing unsupervised concept-based models in
generalization capability and nearly matches the performance of black-box
models. The proposed concept representation enhances information retention and
aligns more closely with human understanding. A user study demonstrates the
discovered concepts are also more intuitive for humans to interpret. Finally,
despite the use of concept embeddings, we maintain model interpretability by
means of a local linear combination of concepts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with

training. SynthRL comprises three key stages: (1) selecting seed questions with
appropriate distribution, (2) augmenting them into more challenging variants
while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage
that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical
experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied
to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable,
challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with
our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual
math reasoning benchmarks, with a significant improvement over baseline models
trained on seed data alone. Notably, detailed analysis reveals that the gains
are more pronounced on the most challenging evaluation samples, highlighting
SynthRL's effectiveness in eliciting deeper and more complex reasoning

Conclusion: 公开解释与去噪机制结合，即使在辅助数据受隐私保护的情况下，仍能有效恢复图结构。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance across many
applications but function as black-box models, limiting their use in critical
domains like healthcare and criminal justice. Explainability methods address
this by providing feature-level explanations that identify important node
attributes for predictions. These explanations create privacy risks. Combined
with auxiliary information, feature explanations can enable adversaries to
reconstruct graph structure, exposing sensitive relationships. Existing graph
reconstruction attacks assume access to original auxiliary data, but practical
systems use differential privacy to protect node features and labels while
providing explanations for transparency. We study a threat model where
adversaries access public feature explanations along with privatized node
features and labels. We show that existing explanation-based attacks like GSEF
perform poorly with privatized data due to noise from differential privacy
mechanisms. We propose ReconXF, a graph reconstruction attack for scenarios
with public explanations and privatized auxiliary data. Our method adapts
explanation-based frameworks by incorporating denoising mechanisms that handle
differential privacy noise while exploiting structural signals in explanations.
Experiments across multiple datasets show ReconXF outperforms SoTA methods in
privatized settings, with improvements in AUC and average precision. Results
indicate that public explanations combined with denoising enable graph
structure recovery even under the privacy protection of auxiliary data. Code is
available at (link to be made public after acceptance).

Motivation: 现有基于LRP的Transformer可解释性方法完全忽略了位置编码（PE），导致守恒性质被破坏，且丢失了与结构和位置特征相关的重要相关性。

Method: 将Transformer的输入空间重新定义为位置-标记对，并提出专门的理论基础LRP规则，适用于多种位置编码方法（如Rotary、Learnable和Absolute PE）。

Conclusion: 通过解决位置编码问题，提出的方法显著提升了Transformer的可解释性，代码已公开。

Abstract: The development of effective explainability tools for Transformers is a
crucial pursuit in deep learning research. One of the most promising approaches
in this domain is Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which propagates
relevance scores backward through the network to the input space by
redistributing activation values based on predefined rules. However, existing
LRP-based methods for Transformer explainability entirely overlook a critical
component of the Transformer architecture: its positional encoding (PE),
resulting in violation of the conservation property, and the loss of an
important and unique type of relevance, which is also associated with
structural and positional features. To address this limitation, we reformulate
the input space for Transformer explainability as a set of position-token
pairs. This allows us to propose specialized theoretically-grounded LRP rules
designed to propagate attributions across various positional encoding methods,
including Rotary, Learnable, and Absolute PE. Extensive experiments with both
fine-tuned classifiers and zero-shot foundation models, such as LLaMA 3,
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in
both vision and NLP explainability tasks. Our code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常值在训练中传播错误梯度，影响模型表现和泛化能力。

Method: 提出Z-Error Loss，利用批次统计自动检测并排除异常样本，专注于真实数据结构。

Result: 方法鲁棒、适应数据质量，并提供数据清洗的诊断工具。

Conclusion: Z-Error Loss有效减少异常值干扰，提升训练效果和数据质量分析。

Abstract: Outliers introduce significant training challenges in neural networks by
propagating erroneous gradients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. We propose the Z-Error Loss, a statistically principled
approach that minimizes outlier influence during training by masking the
contribution of data points identified as out-of-distribution within each
batch. This method leverages batch-level statistics to automatically detect and
exclude anomalous samples, allowing the model to focus its learning on the true
underlying data structure. Our approach is robust, adaptive to data quality,
and provides valuable diagnostics for data curation and cleaning.

Abstract: A central problem in machine learning is often formulated as follows: Given a
dataset $\{(x_j, y_j)\}_{j=1}^M$, which is a sample drawn from an unknown
probability distribution, the goal is to construct a functional model $f$ such
that $f(x) \approx y$ for any $(x, y)$ drawn from the same distribution. Neural
networks and kernel-based methods are commonly employed for this task due to
their capacity for fast and parallel computation. The approximation
capabilities, or expressive power, of these methods have been extensively
studied over the past 35 years. In this paper, we will present examples of key
ideas in this area found in the literature. We will discuss emerging trends in
machine learning including the role of shallow/deep networks, approximation on
manifolds, physics-informed neural surrogates, neural operators, and
transformer architectures. Despite function approximation being a fundamental
problem in machine learning, approximation theory does not play a central role
in the theoretical foundations of the field. One unfortunate consequence of
this disconnect is that it is often unclear how well trained models will
generalize to unseen or unlabeled data. In this review, we examine some of the
shortcomings of the current machine learning framework and explore the reasons
for the gap between approximation theory and machine learning practice. We will
then introduce our novel research to achieve function approximation on unknown
manifolds without the need to learn specific manifold features, such as the
eigen-decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator or atlas construction. In
many machine learning problems, particularly classification tasks, the labels
$y_j$ are drawn from a finite set of values.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过在学习低维表示时显式结合工具变量，解决了传统IV估计器在处理高维内生变量时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IV估计器在处理高维、非结构化内生变量时受限，通常需要先进行无监督降维，但这种方法可能因隐式正则化导致遗漏变量偏差。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，在表示学习过程中显式结合工具变量，以优化低维表示的构建。

Result: 理论和实验表明，该方法能够识别优化结果预测的方向，优于传统两阶段方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理高维内生变量提供了更有效的框架，显著提升了IV回归分析的性能。

Abstract: Traditional instrumental variable (IV) estimators face a fundamental
constraint: they can only accommodate as many endogenous treatment variables as
available instruments. This limitation becomes particularly challenging in
settings where the treatment is presented in a high-dimensional and
unstructured manner (e.g. descriptions of patient treatment pathways in a
hospital). In such settings, researchers typically resort to applying
unsupervised dimension reduction techniques to learn a low-dimensional
treatment representation prior to implementing IV regression analysis. We show
that such methods can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias due to
implicit regularization in the representation learning step. We propose a novel
approach to construct treatment representations by explicitly incorporating
instrumental variables during the representation learning process. Our approach
provides a framework for handling high-dimensional endogenous variables with
limited instruments. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
fitting IV models on these instrument-informed representations ensures
identification of directions that optimize outcome prediction. Our experiments
show that our proposed methodology improves upon the conventional two-stage
approaches that perform dimension reduction without incorporating instrument
information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种约束学习方法，用于优化Sliced Wasserstein (SW)距离的切片方向，通过约束1D传输计划来近似原始空间中的最优计划，从而提高切片方向的信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维概率度量比较中，SW距离需要大量切片才能达到理想性能，计算复杂度高，因此需要优化切片方向以提高效率。

Method: 采用约束学习方法，约束1D传输计划近似原始空间的最优计划，利用梯度对偶方法训练切片参数。

Result: 在图像、点云和蛋白质序列等基础模型上的数值结果表明，该方法能学习到更具信息量的切片方向。

Conclusion: 提出的约束学习方法有效优化了SW距离的切片方向，提升了性能。

Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances offer an efficient method for comparing
high-dimensional probability measures by projecting them onto multiple
1-dimensional probability distributions. However, identifying informative
slicing directions has proven challenging, often necessitating a large number
of slices to achieve desirable performance and thereby increasing computational
complexity. We introduce a constrained learning approach to optimize the
slicing directions for SW distances. Specifically, we constrain the 1D
transport plans to approximate the optimal plan in the original space, ensuring
meaningful slicing directions. By leveraging continuous relaxations of these
transport plans, we enable a gradient-based primal-dual approach to train the
slicer parameters, alongside the remaining model parameters. We demonstrate how
this constrained slicing approach can be applied to pool high-dimensional
embeddings into fixed-length permutation-invariant representations. Numerical
results on foundation models trained on images, point clouds, and protein
sequences showcase the efficacy of the proposed constrained learning approach
in learning more informative slicing directions. Our implementation code can be
found at https://github.com/Stranja572/constrainedswe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CEM的单峰采样策略在多模态环境中容易过早收敛，限制了其优化能力。

Method: 利用Bregman centroid进行信息聚合和多样性控制，通过性能加权更新贡献最小的CEM worker。

Result: 在合成基准、导航任务和MBRL管道中，BC-EvoCEM显著提升了收敛速度和解决方案质量。

Conclusion: BC-EvoCEM是一种轻量级改进，能无缝集成到标准CEM流程中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in
model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy
often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we
propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight
enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for
principled information aggregation and diversity control.
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman
centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling
within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between
Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM
pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks,
a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution
quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.

Motivation: RL在复杂推理行为中表现优异但样本效率低，KD学习效率高但泛化能力差，因此需要一种统一的框架结合两者优势。

Method: KDRL通过策略梯度优化，同时最小化学生与教师分布的反向KL散度（RKL）并最大化基于规则的奖励，整合了GRPO和KD。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，KDRL优于GRPO和多种KD基线，同时平衡了性能和推理效率。

Conclusion: 结合KD和RL是一种高效且有效的训练推理型大语言模型的策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) post-training have leveraged
two distinct paradigms to enhance reasoning capabilities: reinforcement
learning (RL) and knowledge distillation (KD). While RL enables the emergence
of complex reasoning behaviors, it often suffers from low sample efficiency
when the initial policy struggles to explore high-reward trajectories.
Conversely, KD improves learning efficiency via mimicking the teacher model but
tends to generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we present
\textbf{KDRL}, a \textit{unified post-training framework} that jointly
optimizes a reasoning model through teacher supervision (KD) and
self-exploration (RL). Specifically, KDRL leverages policy gradient
optimization to simultaneously minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence
(RKL) between the student and teacher distributions while maximizing the
expected rule-based rewards. We first formulate a unified objective that
integrates GRPO and KD, and systematically explore how different KL
approximations, KL coefficients, and reward-guided KD strategies affect the
overall post-training dynamics and performance. Empirical results on multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KDRL outperforms GRPO and various KD
baselines while achieving a favorable balance between performance and reasoning
token efficiency. These findings indicate that integrating KD and RL serves as
an effective and efficient strategy to train reasoning LLMs.

Motivation: 神经网络参数冗余问题日益突出，现有方法如剪枝或量化未充分利用对称性冗余。

Method: 基于交换性统计特性，提出动态剪枝算法ExPrune，通过预测ReLU负输入实现神经元级剪枝。

Conclusion: ExPrune有效利用对称性冗余，动态剪枝效果显著，且可与静态剪枝结合进一步优化。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are equipped with increasingly many parameters and
require more and more resource for deployment. Researchers have explored
various ways to improve the efficiency of NNs by identifying and reducing the
redundancy, such as pruning or quantizing unimportant weights. Symmetry in the
NN architectures has been identified by prior work as a possible type of
redundancy, but exploiting it for efficient inference is not yet explored. In
this work, we formalize the symmetry of parameters and intermediate values in
NNs using the statistical property of exchangeablility. We identify that
exchangeable values in NN computation may contain overlapping information,
leading to redundancy. Exploiting the insight, we derive a principled general
dynamic pruning algorithm ExPrune to remove symmetry-induced redundancy on a
per-input basis. We also provide an instantiation of ExPrune that performs
neuron-level dynamic pruning by predicting negative inputs to ReLU activations.
We evaluate ExPrune on two computer vision models, one graph model and one
language model. ExPrune provides 10.98--26.3% reduction in FLOPs with
negligible accuracy drop and 21.01--39.05% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1%
accuracy drop. We also demonstrate that ExPrune composes with static pruning.
On models that have been aggressively pruned statically, ExPrune provides
additional 10.24--11.11% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and
13.91--14.39% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop.

Abstract: Learning on small data is a challenge frequently encountered in many
real-world applications. In this work we study how effective quantum ensemble
models are when trained on small data problems in healthcare and life sciences.
We constructed multiple types of quantum ensembles for binary classification
using up to 26 qubits in simulation and 56 qubits on quantum hardware. Our
ensemble designs use minimal trainable parameters but require long-range
connections between qubits. We tested these quantum ensembles on synthetic
datasets and gene expression data from renal cell carcinoma patients with the
task of predicting patient response to immunotherapy. From the performance
observed in simulation and initial hardware experiments, we demonstrate how
quantum embedding structure affects performance and discuss how to extract
informative features and build models that can learn and generalize
effectively. We present these exploratory results in order to assist other
researchers in the design of effective learning on small data using ensembles.
Incorporating quantum computing in these data constrained problems offers hope
for a wide range of studies in healthcare and life sciences where biological
samples are relatively scarce given the feature space to be explored.

Result: 实验表明，auGraph优于基于模式或启发式的图构建方法，提升了预测任务的性能。

Conclusion: auGraph通过任务感知的图增强，有效提升了表格和关系数据的机器学习性能。

Abstract: Tabular and relational data remain the most ubiquitous formats in real-world
machine learning applications, spanning domains from finance to healthcare.
Although both formats offer structured representations, they pose distinct
challenges for modern deep learning methods, which typically assume flat,
feature-aligned inputs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
promising solution by capturing structural dependencies within and between
tables. However, existing GNN-based approaches often rely on rigid,
schema-derived graphs -- such as those based on primary-foreign key links --
thereby underutilizing rich, predictive signals in non key attributes. In this
work, we introduce auGraph, a unified framework for task-aware graph
augmentation that applies to both tabular and relational data. auGraph enhances
base graph structures by selectively promoting attributes into nodes, guided by
scoring functions that quantify their relevance to the downstream prediction
task. This augmentation preserves the original data schema while injecting
task-relevant structural signal. Empirically, auGraph outperforms schema-based
and heuristic graph construction methods by producing graphs that better
support learning for relational and tabular prediction tasks.

Abstract: Most existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks focus on robotics
and control tasks, offering limited relevance to high-stakes domains that
involve structured constraints, mixed-integer decisions, and industrial
complexity. This gap hinders the advancement and deployment of safe RL in
critical areas such as energy systems, manufacturing, and supply chains. To
address this limitation, we present SafeOR-Gym, a benchmark suite of nine
operations research (OR) environments tailored for safe RL under complex
constraints. Each environment captures a realistic planning, scheduling, or
control problems characterized by cost-based constraint violations, planning
horizons, and hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces. The suite integrates
seamlessly with the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) interface
provided by OmniSafe. We evaluate several state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms
across these environments, revealing a wide range of performance: while some
tasks are tractable, others expose fundamental limitations in current
approaches. SafeOR-Gym provides a challenging and practical testbed that aims
to catalyze future research in safe RL for real-world decision-making problems.

Conclusion: HHISS在广泛数据范围内表现优异，具备可行性和可扩展性，适用于敏感场景的移动压力检测。

Abstract: Stress affects physical and mental health, and wearable devices have been
widely used to detect daily stress through physiological signals. However,
these signals vary due to factors such as individual differences and health
conditions, making generalizing machine learning models difficult. To address
these challenges, we present Human Heterogeneity Invariant Stress Sensing
(HHISS), a domain generalization approach designed to find consistent patterns
in stress signals by removing person-specific differences. This helps the model
perform more accurately across new people, environments, and stress types not
seen during training. Its novelty lies in proposing a novel technique called
person-wise sub-network pruning intersection to focus on shared features across
individuals, alongside preventing overfitting by leveraging continuous labels
while training. The study focuses especially on people with opioid use disorder
(OUD)-a group where stress responses can change dramatically depending on their
time of daily medication taking. Since stress often triggers cravings, a model
that can adapt well to these changes could support better OUD rehabilitation
and recovery. We tested HHISS on seven different stress datasets-four of which
we collected ourselves and three public ones. Four are from lab setups, one
from a controlled real-world setting, driving, and two are from real-world
in-the-wild field datasets without any constraints. This is the first study to
evaluate how well a stress detection model works across such a wide range of
data. Results show HHISS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baseline
methods, proving both effective and practical for real-world use. Ablation
studies, empirical justifications, and runtime evaluations confirm HHISS's
feasibility and scalability for mobile stress sensing in sensitive real-world
applications.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective for tasks with known
underlying symmetries. However, optimizing equivariant networks can be tricky
and best training practices are less established than for standard networks. In
particular, recent works have found small training benefits from relaxing
equivariance constraints. This raises the question: do equivariance constraints
introduce fundamental obstacles to optimization? Or do they simply require
different hyperparameter tuning? In this work, we investigate this question
through a theoretical analysis of the loss landscape geometry. We focus on
networks built using permutation representations, which we can view as a subset
of unconstrained MLPs. Importantly, we show that the parameter symmetries of
the unconstrained model has nontrivial effects on the loss landscape of the
equivariant subspace and under certain conditions can provably prevent learning
of the global minima. Further, we empirically demonstrate in such cases,
relaxing to an unconstrained MLP can sometimes solve the issue. Interestingly,
the weights eventually found via relaxation corresponds to a different choice
of group representation in the hidden layer. From this, we draw 3 key
takeaways. (1) Viewing any class of networks in the context of larger
unconstrained function space can give important insights on loss landscape
structure. (2) Within the unconstrained function space, equivariant networks
form a complicated union of linear hyperplanes, each associated with a specific
choice of internal group representation. (3) Effective relaxation of
equivariance may require not only adding nonequivariant degrees of freedom, but
also rethinking the fixed choice of group representations in hidden layers.

Motivation: 传统随机插值（SI）方法需要直接访问两个分布的样本，限制了其在联合优化的潜在变量模型中的应用。LSI旨在解决这一问题。

Result: LSI在标准大规模ImageNet生成基准测试中表现出色，能够学习有效的潜在表示和生成过程。

Conclusion: LSI不仅避免了简单先验的限制，还保留了SI框架的生成灵活性，同时降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Stochastic Interpolants (SI) are a powerful framework for generative
modeling, capable of flexibly transforming between two probability
distributions. However, their use in jointly optimized latent variable models
remains unexplored as they require direct access to the samples from the two
distributions. This work presents Latent Stochastic Interpolants (LSI) enabling
joint learning in a latent space with end-to-end optimized encoder, decoder and
latent SI models. We achieve this by developing a principled Evidence Lower
Bound (ELBO) objective derived directly in continuous time. The joint
optimization allows LSI to learn effective latent representations along with a
generative process that transforms an arbitrary prior distribution into the
encoder-defined aggregated posterior. LSI sidesteps the simple priors of the
normal diffusion models and mitigates the computational demands of applying SI
directly in high-dimensional observation spaces, while preserving the
generative flexibility of the SI framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of LSI
through comprehensive experiments on the standard large scale ImageNet
generation benchmark.

Motivation: 当前强化微调（RFT）范式因均匀数据采样导致样本效率低下，而现有方法忽略了模型自身的学习信号。

Result: GAIN-RL在数学和编程任务上实现2.5倍训练效率提升，且仅需一半数据即可优于传统方法。

Conclusion: GAIN-RL通过动态数据选择显著提升训练效率和性能，为LLM微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) paradigms for Large Language Models
(LLMs) suffer from sample inefficiency due to the redundant exposure of
identical queries under uniform data sampling. While previous work has explored
curriculum learning via heuristic difficulty metrics, these strategies exhibit
limitations by neglecting the intrinsic learning signals generated by the model
itself, thus leading to suboptimal training regimes. In this paper, we identify
a model-inherent signal termed angle concentration that effectively reflects an
LLM's capacity to learn from specific data. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate a correlation between the angular distribution of token hidden
state vectors and the resulting gradient, revealing a learning preference for
data exhibiting higher angle concentration. Inspired by this finding, we
propose GAIN-RL, a Gradient-driven Angle-Informed Navigated RL framework. By
leveraging the model's intrinsic angle concentration signal, GAIN-RL
dynamically selects training data in each epoch, ensuring consistently
impactful gradient updates and thus significantly enhancing overall training
efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that GAIN-RL (GRPO) achieves over a 2.5x
acceleration in training efficiency across diverse mathematical and coding
tasks and varying model scales. Furthermore, GAIN-RL (GRPO)'s efficient
sampling yields data-efficient training, achieving better performance with half
the original data compared to vanilla GRPO with full training data. Code is

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks provide a principled framework for incorporating
symmetry into learning architectures and have been extensively analyzed through
the lens of their separation power, that is, the ability to distinguish inputs
modulo symmetry. This notion plays a central role in settings such as graph
learning, where it is often formalized via the Weisfeiler-Leman hierarchy. In
contrast, the universality of equivariant models-their capacity to approximate
target functions-remains comparatively underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the approximation power of equivariant neural networks beyond
separation constraints. We show that separation power does not fully capture
expressivity: models with identical separation power may differ in their
approximation ability. To demonstrate this, we characterize the universality
classes of shallow invariant networks, providing a general framework for
understanding which functions these architectures can approximate. Since
equivariant models reduce to invariant ones under projection, this analysis
yields sufficient conditions under which shallow equivariant networks fail to
be universal. Conversely, we identify settings where shallow models do achieve
separation-constrained universality. These positive results, however, depend
critically on structural properties of the symmetry group, such as the
existence of adequate normal subgroups, which may not hold in important cases
like permutation symmetry.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成语义明确、空间一致的变形，揭示了分类器最敏感的方向及其决策边界的几何特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经分类器的内部表示提供了新的可解释视角。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations and decision mechanisms of deep
neural networks remains a critical open challenge. While existing
interpretability methods often identify influential input regions, they may not
elucidate how a model distinguishes between classes or what specific changes
would transition an input from one category to another. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel framework that visualizes the implicit path
between classes by treating the network gradient as a form of infinitesimal
motion. Drawing inspiration from phase-based motion magnification, we first
decompose images using invertible transforms-specifically the Complex Steerable
Pyramid-then compute class-conditional gradients in the transformed space.
Rather than iteratively integrating the gradient to trace a full path, we
amplify the one-step gradient to the input and perform a linear extrapolation
to expose how the model moves from source to target class. By operating in the
steerable pyramid domain, these amplified gradients produce semantically
meaningful, spatially coherent morphs that highlight the classifier's most
sensitive directions, giving insight into the geometry of its decision
boundaries. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our phase-focused extrapolation yields perceptually aligned, semantically
meaningful transformations, offering a novel, interpretable lens into neural
classifiers' internal representations.

Abstract: We present CACTI, a masked autoencoding approach for imputing tabular data
that leverages the structure in missingness patterns and contextual
information. Our approach employs a novel median truncated copy masking
training strategy that encourages the model to learn from empirical patterns of
missingness while incorporating semantic relationships between features -
captured by column names and text descriptions - to better represent feature
dependence. These dual sources of inductive bias enable CACTI to outperform
state-of-the-art methods - an average $R^2$ gain of 7.8% over the next best
method (13.4%, 6.1%, and 5.3% under missing not at random, at random and
completely at random, respectively) - across a diverse range of datasets and
missingness conditions. Our results highlight the value of leveraging
dataset-specific contextual information and missingness patterns to enhance

Motivation: 探索如何通过任务分组优化多模态基础模型的指令微调性能，而非简单地增加任务数量。

Method: 提出MINT策略，根据多模态交互类型（如冗余共享信息、独特信息优先选择或协同融合）对任务进行分组。

Result: MINT在多模态指令微调中显著优于现有任务分组基线，平衡了泛化与专业化。

Conclusion: 任务分组策略比单纯增加任务数量更有效，MINT为多模态指令微调提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have achieved
state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks. These breakthroughs are
largely driven by new pre-training paradigms that leverage large-scale,
unlabeled multimodal data, followed by instruction fine-tuning on curated
labeled datasets and high-quality prompts. While there is growing interest in
scaling instruction fine-tuning to ever-larger datasets in both quantity and
scale, our findings reveal that simply increasing the number of
instruction-tuning tasks does not consistently yield better performance.
Instead, we observe that grouping tasks by the common interactions across
modalities, such as discovering redundant shared information, prioritizing
modality selection with unique information, or requiring synergistic fusion to
discover new information from both modalities, encourages the models to learn
transferrable skills within a group while suppressing interference from
mismatched tasks. To this end, we introduce MINT, a simple yet surprisingly
effective task-grouping strategy based on the type of multimodal interaction.
We demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms existing task
grouping baselines for multimodal instruction tuning, striking an effective
balance between generalization and specialization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种消除测试点的新方法，通过高保真数字模型生成降阶模型（ROM），利用机器学习动态更新模型，以飞行测试数据验证和优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试点方法因飞行员偏离预设条件而失效，且数据带和容差的存在是更根本的问题，需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 使用高保真数字模型生成ROM，通过机器学习（如高斯过程回归）动态更新模型，利用飞行测试数据验证和优化。

Result: 通过T-38C飞行测试数据验证，ROM能够动态更新并生成符合MIL-STD-1797B标准的参数。

Conclusion: 提出的“无测试点”架构通过ROM动态更新和验证高保真模型，解决了传统测试点方法的局限性。

Abstract: The justification for the "test point" derives from the test pilot's
obligation to reproduce faithfully the pre-specified conditions of some model
prediction. Pilot deviation from those conditions invalidates the model
assumptions. Flight test aids have been proposed to increase accuracy on more
challenging test points. However, the very existence of databands and
tolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We
propose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a
high-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to
generate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a
reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can
generate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second,
if the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can
be updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM
at whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the
high-fidelity model. We present a single example of this "point-less"
architecture, using T-38C flight test data. We first use a generic aircraft
model to build a ROM of longitudinal pitching motion as a hypersurface. We then
ingest unconstrained flight test data and use Gaussian Process Regression to
update and condition the hypersurface. By proposing a second-order equivalent
system for the T-38C, this hypersurface then generates parameters necessary to
assess MIL-STD-1797B compliance for longitudinal dynamics.

Result: 首次证明了吸收率矩阵下τ-leaping和均匀化采样器的收敛性，且在某些假设下无需提前停止。

Conclusion: 本文填补了吸收扩散模型的理论空白，为实际应用提供了更可靠的理论基础。

Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in
applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has
also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of
rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While
empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better
generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical
works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably,
convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are
still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and
convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate
matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the
forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address
the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a
singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the
first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization
samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their
counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable
assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our
analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to
absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding
forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score
functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization
that removes the need of early-stopping.

Abstract: We formulate an optimization problem to estimate probability densities in the
context of multidimensional problems that are sampled with uneven probability.
It considers detector sensitivity as an heterogeneous density and takes
advantage of the computational speed and flexible boundary conditions offered
by splines on a grid. We choose to regularize the Hessian of the spline via the
nuclear norm to promote sparsity. As a result, the method is spatially adaptive
and stable against the choice of the regularization parameter, which plays the
role of the bandwidth. We test our computational pipeline on standard densities
and provide software. We also present a new approach to PET rebinning as an
application of our framework.

Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations
across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and
fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning
Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for
problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying
partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus
and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge
values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty
quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a
subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel
complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces
conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two
representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood
flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity,
highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and
reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.

Conclusion: 新方法在定理证明任务中表现优异，提供了有效的RL训练方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective framework for training
large language models on structured language-conditioned tasks. We identify a
critical flaw of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a widely used RL
algorithm in this setting. For tasks that require multi-sample performance,
such as formal theorem proving, GRPO biasedly reinforces already probable
solutions and neglects rare but correct proofs. This implicit bias impairs
performance on pass@$N$ metrics at large sample sizes, limiting its
practicality for training theorem provers. To address this, we introduce the
unlikeliness reward, a straightforward method that explicitly encourages
reinforcing rare correct solutions. Additionally, we find that increasing the
number of PPO epochs further mitigates this bias. Our experiments confirm that
incorporating the unlikeliness reward significantly improves pass@$N$ across a
large range of N, outperforming standard GRPO and substantially increasing
sample diversity. Applying our revised recipe to Lean, we achieve competitive
performance with DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL on the miniF2F-test benchmark. We
release our implementation, providing a simple yet effective recipe for
training formal theorem provers with RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零阶随机梯度下降（ZO-SGD）方法在联邦学习中通信效率高，但梯度估计的高方差导致收敛缓慢。利用Hessian信息可以加速优化，但将其整合到联邦学习中面临数据限制和通信维度自由的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种广义的标量通信联邦学习框架，将维度自由通信与标准ZO-SGD解耦，并在此基础上开发了HiSo方法，利用全局曲率信息加速收敛，同时保持每轮最低通信成本。

Result: 理论分析表明，HiSo的收敛速度与全局Lipschitz常数无关，且在全局Hessian低有效秩时更快。实验证明，HiSo在收敛速度和通信效率上显著优于现有基于ZO的联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: HiSo通过结合Hessian信息和标量通信，成功解决了联邦学习中高方差和低收敛速度的问题，为LLM微调提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent dimension-free communication frameworks in Federated Learning (FL),
such as DeComFL, significantly reduce per-round communication by transmitting
only scalars via zeroth-order stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD). This method
is particularly advantageous for federated fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Yet, the high variance in ZO gradient estimation typically leads to
slow convergence. Although leveraging Hessian information is known to enhance
optimization speed, integrating this into FL presents significant challenges.
These include clients' restrictions on local data and the critical need to
maintain the dimension-free communication property. To overcome this
limitation, we first introduce a generalized scalar-only communication FL
framework that decouples dimension-free communication from standard ZO-SGD,
enabling the integration of more advanced optimization strategies. Building on
this framework, we propose HiSo, a fast federated fine-tuning method via
Hessian-informed zeroth-order optimization and Scalar-only communication.
Specifically, it leverages global curvature information to accelerate
convergence while preserving the same minimal communication cost per round.
Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees that are independent of the
global Lipschitz constant, and further show that HiSo achieves faster rates
when the global Hessian exhibits a low effective rank -- a common phenomenon in
LLMs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and LLM fine-tuning tasks
confirm that HiSo significantly outperforms existing ZO-based FL methods in
both convergence speed and communication efficiency.

Conclusion: SFBD flow简化了SFBD的实现流程，并在性能上表现优异，为解决扩散模型的隐私问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve strong generative performance but often rely on
large datasets that may include sensitive content. This challenge is compounded
by the models' tendency to memorize training data, raising privacy concerns.
SFBD (Lu et al., 2025) addresses this by training on corrupted data and using
limited clean samples to capture local structure and improve convergence.
However, its iterative denoising and fine-tuning loop requires manual
coordination, making it burdensome to implement. We reinterpret SFBD as an
alternating projection algorithm and introduce a continuous variant, SFBD flow,
that removes the need for alternating steps. We further show its connection to
consistency constraint-based methods, and demonstrate that its practical
instantiation, Online SFBD, consistently outperforms strong baselines across
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 马尔可夫纠缠可作为值分解质量的实用评估指标。

Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent
dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value
function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the
sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$.
This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit
problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the
theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively
remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables
value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process
(MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not
"entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics.
Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we
introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and
show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general
multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class
of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal
O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we
show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice,
providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value
decomposition.

Abstract: The challenge of identifying the best feasible arm within a fixed budget has
attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains
in the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability
approaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple
setting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address
this gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We
introduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that
guarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay
rate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound
derived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a
posterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule
involving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations
with Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the
identification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate
the effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations
across various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The
results corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method
outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world
dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and
ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their
effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data
remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances
LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text
and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data
pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition
to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences.
Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data
using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with
smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B
demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared
to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study
highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.

Abstract: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) faces significant challenges posed by label
noise, especially in multiclass classification tasks. Existing methods either
lack mechanisms to handle label noise effectively or suffer from high
computational costs due to redundant data usage. Inspired by granular
computing, this paper proposes granular adaptive boosting (GAdaBoost), a novel
two-stage framework comprising a data granulation stage and an adaptive
boosting stage, to enhance efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions. To
validate its feasibility, an extension of SAMME, termed GAdaBoost.SA, is
proposed. Specifically, first, a granular-ball generation method is designed to
compress data while preserving diversity and mitigating label noise. Second,
the granular ball-based SAMME algorithm focuses on granular balls rather than
individual samples, improving efficiency and reducing sensitivity to noise.
Experimental results on some noisy datasets show that the proposed approach
achieves superior robustness and efficiency compared with existing methods,
demonstrating that this work effectively extends AdaBoost and SAMME.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising
learning-based paradigm for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by
minimizing the need for extensive manual engineering. While existing NCO
methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated
considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance
significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation
arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data,
rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by
Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the
training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the
scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that
necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates
exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model
retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a
backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance
on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出将随机傅里叶特征作为表格数据深度学习的预处理步骤，通过固定频率的正弦和余弦投影改善训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据深度学习流程存在不足，通过神经切线核（NTK）分析发现随机傅里叶映射可作为参数无关、架构无关的改进方法。

Method: 使用初始化时随机生成的频率对输入进行正弦和余弦投影，固定特征空间映射，无需额外学习嵌入或归一化。

Result: 该方法在NTK框架下优化了初始NTK谱，缩短优化轨迹，加速训练；实验显示训练更快且性能更稳定。

Conclusion: 随机傅里叶预处理是一种理论支持、即插即用的表格深度学习增强方法。

Abstract: While random Fourier features are a classic tool in kernel methods, their
utility as a pre-processing step for deep learning on tabular data has been
largely overlooked. Motivated by shortcomings in tabular deep learning
pipelines - revealed through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis - we revisit
and repurpose random Fourier mappings as a parameter-free,
architecture-agnostic transformation. By projecting each input into a fixed
feature space via sine and cosine projections with frequencies drawn once at
initialization, this approach circumvents the need for ad hoc normalization or
additional learnable embeddings. We show within the NTK framework that this
mapping (i) bounds and conditions the network's initial NTK spectrum, and (ii)
introduces a bias that shortens the optimization trajectory, thereby
accelerating gradient-based training. These effects pre-condition the network
with a stable kernel from the outset. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep
networks trained on Fourier-transformed inputs converge more rapidly and
consistently achieve strong final performance, often with fewer epochs and less
hyperparameter tuning. Our findings establish random Fourier pre-processing as
a theoretically motivated, plug-and-play enhancement for tabular deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法在动态非线性系统中难以保持稳定性和适应性，尤其是在不确定性环境下。

Method: AERO基于15条相互关联的公理，包括对抗校正、能量守恒和扰动感知学习，通过梯度投影、不确定性驱动动态和学习能量管理实现优化。

Result: 在概率太阳能预测中，AERO显著提高了预测准确性、可靠性和适应性，特别是在噪声和不确定环境中。

Conclusion: AERO为优化理论和实践提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Optimization remains a fundamental pillar of machine learning, yet existing
methods often struggle to maintain stability and adaptability in dynamic, non
linear systems, especially under uncertainty. We introduce AERO (Adversarial
Energy-based Redirection Optimization), a novel framework inspired by the
redirection principle in Judo, where external disturbances are leveraged rather
than resisted. AERO reimagines optimization as a redirection process guided by
15 interrelated axioms encompassing adversarial correction, energy
conservation, and disturbance-aware learning. By projecting gradients,
integrating uncertainty driven dynamics, and managing learning energy, AERO
offers a principled approach to stable and robust model updates. Applied to
probabilistic solar energy forecasting, AERO demonstrates substantial gains in
predictive accuracy, reliability, and adaptability, especially in noisy and
uncertain environments. Our findings highlight AERO as a compelling new
direction in the theoretical and practical landscape of optimization.

Result: 在三个真实数据集和合成基准上，WSNET的F1分数比现有方法高出15%。

Conclusion: 弱监督对比学习在图数据中有效，利用不完美标签具有潜力。

Abstract: Node classification in real world graphs often suffers from label scarcity
and noise, especially in high stakes domains like human trafficking detection
and misinformation monitoring. While direct supervision is limited, such graphs
frequently contain weak signals, noisy or indirect cues, that can still inform
learning. We propose WSNET, a novel weakly supervised graph contrastive
learning framework that leverages these weak signals to guide robust
representation learning. WSNET integrates graph structure, node features, and
multiple noisy supervision sources through a contrastive objective tailored for
weakly labeled data. Across three real world datasets and synthetic benchmarks
with controlled noise, WSNET consistently outperforms state of the art
contrastive and noisy label learning methods by up to 15% in F1 score. Our
results highlight the effectiveness of contrastive learning under weak
supervision and the promise of exploiting imperfect labels in graph based
settings.

Motivation: 研究动机是改进现有序列建模方法（如Gated DeltaNet、TTT和RWKV-7）的局限性，通过Delta学习规则优化递归内存管理。

Method: 基于闭环控制理论，提出了一种名为Comba的非线性RNN变体，采用标量加低秩状态转移，并结合状态反馈和输出反馈修正。

Result: 在340M/1.3B参数的大规模语料库上训练，Comba在语言和视觉建模中表现出优越性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: Comba通过非线性递归结构和硬件高效实现，为序列建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and
RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent
memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space
models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models
introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector,
resulting in a nonlinear recursive structure. In this paper, we first introduce
the concept of Nonlinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages
and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we
propose a novel Nonlinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a
scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output
feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise
parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on
large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates its superior performance and computation
efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法在非光滑FCCO中存在高迭代复杂度和不适用于深度学习的局限性，需要更高效的算法。

Method: 提出随机动量方法，优化非光滑FCCO，并应用于平滑铰链惩罚公式的多不等式约束问题。

Result: 将迭代复杂度提升至$O(1/\epsilon^5)$，并在实验中验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法显著提升了非光滑FCCO的优化效率，并在实际任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Finite-sum Coupled Compositional Optimization (FCCO), characterized by its
coupled compositional objective structure, emerges as an important optimization
paradigm for addressing a wide range of machine learning problems. In this
paper, we focus on a challenging class of non-convex non-smooth FCCO, where the
outer functions are non-smooth weakly convex or convex and the inner functions
are smooth or weakly convex. Existing state-of-the-art result face two key
limitations: (1) a high iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^6)$ under the
assumption that the stochastic inner functions are Lipschitz continuous in
expectation; (2) reliance on vanilla SGD-type updates, which are not suitable
for deep learning applications. Our main contributions are two fold: (i) We
propose stochastic momentum methods tailored for non-smooth FCCO that come with
provable convergence guarantees; (ii) We establish a new state-of-the-art
iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^5)$. Moreover, we apply our algorithms to
multiple inequality constrained non-convex optimization problems involving
smooth or weakly convex functional inequality constraints. By optimizing a
smoothed hinge penalty based formulation, we achieve a new state-of-the-art
complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^5)$ for finding an (nearly) $\epsilon$-level KKT
solution. Experiments on three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms.

Motivation: 解决计算机代理因记忆积累导致的虚假学习问题，特别是在生产力软件等特定领域。

Method: 结合专家知识、迭代记忆优化和人工事实核查的三步框架。

Result: 在OSWorld生产力任务中，VerificAgent比基线方法提升了111.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: VerificAgent能有效管理记忆，显著提升代理性能。

Abstract: Continual memory augmentation allows computer-use agents (CUAs) to learn from
past interactions and refine their task-solving strategies over time. However,
unchecked memory accumulation can introduce spurious or hallucinated
"learnings" that degrade agent performance, particularly in domain-specific
workflows such as productivity software. We present a novel framework,
VerificAgent, that effectively manages memory for CUAs through (1) an
expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory
refinement during training, and (3) a post-hoc fact-checking pass by human
experts to sanitize accumulated memory before deployment. On OSWorld
productivity tasks, VerificAgent achieves a 111.1% relative improvement in
success rate over baseline CUA without any additional fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法在大型视觉语言模型中未能妥善选择替代输出，导致遗忘后产生不良行为。论文强调需关注遗忘后响应的质量和信息性。

Method: 提出PUBG方法，明确引导遗忘后的行为朝向理想的输出分布，确保隐私保护且信息丰富的响应。

Result: 实验表明，PUBG有效缓解了遗忘副作用，生成视觉基础和信息丰富的响应，且无隐私泄露。

Conclusion: PUBG为LVLMs提供了一种更优的遗忘方法，兼顾隐私保护和响应质量。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data.
However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute
outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable
behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses.
We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider
the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than
relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new
unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving
yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel
unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a
desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods
suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy
violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually
grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten
targets.

Conclusion: HIEGNet为肾小球健康分类提供了一种有效方法，其公开实现有助于进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in
histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have
not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an
important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties,
particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes,
edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed
of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques
to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a
heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN
architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both
glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to
consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our
HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney
transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms
several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all
baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决LLM强化学习中非终端动作（中间token生成）无即时奖励的问题，提供理论支持以减少对精确token级奖励的依赖。

Method: 引入轨迹策略梯度定理，分析现有算法（如PPO、GRPO）的理论基础，并提出新算法TRePO。

Result: 证明响应级奖励足以无偏估计token级奖励，新算法TRePO在理论和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM微调提供了更实用的方法，开发者可专注于改进响应级奖励模型，同时TRePO展现出广泛适用性。

Abstract: We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language
models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e.,
intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward,
while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This
assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are
often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we
provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy
Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown
token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level
reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not,
for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals
that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess
the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical
justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way
for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat
training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level
reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of
popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and
practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new
algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically
grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency,
and holds promise for broad applicability.

Conclusion: 扩展了差分隐私在联邦学习中的应用，为部分参与的分布式系统提供了一种高效且实用的隐私保护学习解决方案。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of achieving Differential Privacy (DP) in
Federated Learning (FL) under partial-participation, where only a subset of the
machines participate in each time-step. While previous work achieved optimal
performance in full-participation settings, these methods struggled to extend
to partial-participation scenarios. Our approach fills this gap by introducing
a novel noise-cancellation mechanism that preserves privacy without sacrificing
convergence rates or computational efficiency. We analyze our method within the
Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) framework and show that it delivers
optimal performance for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.
This work expands the applicability of DP in FL, offering an efficient and
practical solution for privacy-preserving learning in distributed systems with
partial participation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Top-k注意力机制在效率和准确性之间难以平衡，HATA通过哈希技术解决这一问题。

Method: HATA将查询和键映射为二进制哈希码，以低成本获取相对qk分数顺序，实现Top-k注意力。

Result: 实验表明，HATA比传统注意力快7.2倍，且在主流LLM模型和任务中优于现有Top-k方法。

Conclusion: HATA在效率和准确性上均表现优异，为LLM推理提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a pivotal research area, yet the
attention module remains a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, even with
techniques like KVCache to mitigate redundant computations. While various
top-$k$ attention mechanisms have been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by
exploiting the inherent sparsity of attention, they often struggled to strike a
balance between efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HATA
(Hash-Aware Top-$k$ Attention), a novel approach that systematically integrates
low-overhead learning-to-hash techniques into the Top-$k$ attention process.
Different from the existing top-k attention methods which are devoted to
seeking an absolute estimation of qk score, typically with a great cost, HATA
maps queries and keys into binary hash codes, and acquires the relative qk
score order with a quite low cost, which is sufficient for realizing top-k
attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HATA achieves up to
7.2$\times$ speedup compared to vanilla full attention while maintaining model
accuracy. In addition, HATA outperforms the state-of-the-art top-$k$ attention
methods in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple mainstream LLM models
and diverse tasks. HATA is open source at https://github.com/gpzlx1/HATA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习中，均匀采样方法需要大量数据且会产生许多不可达的状态-目标-动作对，影响策略性能。

Method: 提出RWS方法，通过可到达性分类器（基于PU学习）为状态-动作对分配采样优先级。

Result: 在六个复杂机器人操作任务中，RWS显著提升性能，其中HandBlock-Z任务性能提升近50%。

Conclusion: RWS是一种即插即用的模块，能有效提升离线目标条件强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) relies on fixed datasets
where many potential goals share the same state and action spaces. However,
these potential goals are not explicitly represented in the collected
trajectories. To learn a generalizable goal-conditioned policy, it is common to
sample goals and state-action pairs uniformly using dynamic programming methods
such as Q-learning. Uniform sampling, however, requires an intractably large
dataset to cover all possible combinations and creates many unreachable
state-goal-action pairs that degrade policy performance. Our key insight is
that sampling should favor transitions that enable goal achievement. To this
end, we propose Reachability Weighted Sampling (RWS). RWS uses a reachability
classifier trained via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning on goal-conditioned
state-action values. The classifier maps these values to a reachability score,
which is then used as a sampling priority. RWS is a plug-and-play module that
integrates seamlessly with standard offline RL algorithms. Experiments on six
complex simulated robotic manipulation tasks, including those with a robot arm
and a dexterous hand, show that RWS significantly improves performance. In one
notable case, performance on the HandBlock-Z task improved by nearly 50 percent
relative to the baseline. These results indicate the effectiveness of
reachability-weighted sampling.

Abstract: The ability to operate safely in increasingly complex traffic scenarios is a
fundamental requirement for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the safe
release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring
traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline
for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category
completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder
(CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and
utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario
categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the
completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The
results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work.
The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to
maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD
dataset.

capabilities in processing heterogeneous information networks. Self-supervised
learning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised
strategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this
approach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies
and the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level
of similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we
propose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal
Transport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised
learning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies.
Different from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs
the optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of
positive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view
(central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views
represented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an
optimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the
semantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the
optimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations,
forcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the
graph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node
classification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in
accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Siamese网络代理模型的NAS方法SiamNAS，显著降低了计算成本，并在实验中高效找到Pareto最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代NAS是多目标的，计算成本高且需要高效近似方法，因此提出轻量级代理模型来预测架构间的支配关系。

Method: 使用Siamese网络块集成作为代理模型，替代拥挤距离计算，并基于模型大小设计启发式规则。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-201上，SiamNAS以0.01 GPU天找到CIFAR-10最佳架构和ImageNet第二佳架构。

Conclusion: Siamese网络代理模型在多任务优化中潜力显著，并可扩展用于生成多样Pareto最优解。

Abstract: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective,
balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost.
This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to
solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel
surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network
blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures.
Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces
the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a
heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS,
this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process.
Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify
Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The
proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best
architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in
terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study
highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to
generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation
across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for
generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal
solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出HAM（Hyperbolic Aware Minimization）方法，通过交替优化步骤和双曲镜像步骤，解决过参数化导致的收敛慢问题，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解优化算法的隐式偏差对解释深度学习模型的泛化行为至关重要。过参数化虽能促进稀疏性，但会导致有效学习率降低，影响收敛速度。

Method: HAM方法结合梯度下降和双曲镜像步骤，推导其黎曼梯度流，并与自然梯度下降关联，提供隐式偏差的精确描述。

Result: HAM在多种任务中表现优异，尤其与稀疏化方法结合时，性能超越现有技术，且计算开销小。

Conclusion: HAM通过双曲几何优化，显著提升模型性能，适用于多种任务，且易于实现。

Abstract: Understanding the implicit bias of optimization algorithms has become central
to explaining the generalization behavior of deep learning models. For
instance, the hyperbolic implicit bias induced by the overparameterization $m
\odot w$--though effective in promoting sparsity--can result in a small
effective learning rate, which slows down convergence. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose HAM (Hyperbolic Aware Minimization), which alternates
between an optimizer step and a new hyperbolic mirror step. We derive the
Riemannian gradient flow for its combination with gradient descent, leading to
improved convergence and a similar beneficial hyperbolic geometry as $m \odot
w$ for feature learning. We provide an interpretation of the the algorithm by
relating it to natural gradient descent, and an exact characterization of its
implicit bias for underdetermined linear regression. HAM's implicit bias
consistently boosts performance--even of dense training, as we demonstrate in
experiments across diverse tasks, including vision, graph and node
classification, and large language model fine-tuning. HAM is especially
effective in combination with different sparsification methods, improving upon
the state of the art. The hyperbolic step requires minimal computational and
memory overhead, it succeeds even with small batch sizes, and its
implementation integrates smoothly with existing optimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市交通流量预测在智能交通系统中至关重要，但现有方法因数据不完整和确定性预测而受限，且缺乏跨城市泛化能力。

Method: 提出TrafficPPT框架，结合实时观测、历史轨迹和路网拓扑数据，通过预训练和微调实现不确定性建模和跨城市适应。

Result: 实验表明TrafficPPT在数据稀疏条件下优于现有方法，具有更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TrafficPPT通过概率建模和多源数据融合，解决了交通预测中的不确定性和泛化问题，为智能交通提供了有效工具。

Abstract: City-scale traffic volume prediction plays a pivotal role in intelligent
transportation systems, yet remains a challenge due to the inherent
incompleteness and bias in observational data. Although deep learning-based
methods have shown considerable promise, most existing approaches produce
deterministic point estimates, thereby neglecting the uncertainty arising from
unobserved traffic flows. Furthermore, current models are typically trained in
a city-specific manner, which hinders their generalizability and limits
scalability across diverse urban contexts. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TrafficPPT, a Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer designed to model
traffic volume as a distributional aggregation of trajectories. Our framework
fuses heterogeneous data sources-including real-time observations, historical
trajectory data, and road network topology-enabling robust and
uncertainty-aware traffic inference. TrafficPPT is initially pretrained on
large-scale simulated data spanning multiple urban scenarios, and later
fine-tuned on target cities to ensure effective domain adaptation. Experiments
on real-world datasets show that TrafficPPT consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under conditions of extreme data
sparsity. Code will be open.

Motivation: 随着AI技术的发展，版权内容面临未经授权使用的风险增加，现有方法仅提供短期保护，需针对模型架构变化重新训练。

Method: 基于概率和逆问题的框架，嵌入可见且难以去除的水印，通过最大化最优重建与原始内容的差异实现保护。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种场景下表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为长期版权保护提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI advances, copyrighted content faces growing risk of unauthorized use,
whether through model training or direct misuse. Building upon invisible
adversarial perturbation, recent works developed copyright protections against
specific AI techniques such as unauthorized personalization through DreamBooth
that are misused. However, these methods offer only short-term security, as
they require retraining whenever the underlying model architectures change. To
establish long-term protection aiming at better robustness, we go beyond
invisible perturbation, and propose a universal approach that embeds
\textit{visible} watermarks that are \textit{hard-to-remove} into images.
Grounded in a new probabilistic and inverse problem-based formulation, our
framework maximizes the discrepancy between the \textit{optimal} reconstruction
and the original content. We develop an effective and efficient approximation
algorithm to circumvent a intractable bi-level optimization. Experimental
results demonstrate superiority of our approach across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 现有注意力机制在捕捉时间序列数据中的非线性依赖方面存在不足，需要改进。

Method: 用Chatterjee秩相关系数替代标准注意力机制中的矩阵乘法，并引入可微分的SoftSort和SoftRank近似计算。

Result: 在真实数据集上，XicorAttention将预测准确性提高了约9.1%。

Conclusion: XicorAttention通过引入非线性相关性，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series
forecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture
long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can
be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by
making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate
temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately
capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving
room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism
based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear
dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix
multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to
measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation
coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a
differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed
mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art
Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate
that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves
forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.

Result: 实验表明WARMPOT与现有方法竞争，且提出的权重优于现有方案。

Conclusion: 理论推导和实验验证了部分最优传输在PDA中的有效性，为权重设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In many scenarios of practical interest, labeled data from a target
distribution are scarce while labeled data from a related source distribution
are abundant. One particular setting of interest arises when the target label
space is a subset of the source label space, leading to the framework of
partial domain adaptation (PDA). Typical approaches to PDA involve minimizing a
domain alignment term and a weighted empirical loss on the source data, with
the aim of transferring knowledge between domains. However, a theoretical basis
for this procedure is lacking, and in particular, most existing weighting
schemes are heuristic. In this work, we derive generalization bounds for the
PDA problem based on partial optimal transport. These bounds corroborate the
use of the partial Wasserstein distance as a domain alignment term, and lead to
theoretically motivated explicit expressions for the empirical source loss
weights. Inspired by these bounds, we devise a practical algorithm for PDA,
termed WARMPOT. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that WARMPOT
is competitive with recent approaches, and that our proposed weights improve on
existing schemes.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在现实应用中受限于固定知识截止和输出控制问题，多智能体系统（MAS）提供了一种解决方案，但优化这些系统仍面临挑战。

Result: 实验表明，MHGPO在多智能体LLM搜索系统中表现优于MAPPO，任务性能和计算效率均有提升。

Conclusion: MHGPO为复杂LLM-based MAS的稳定和可扩展优化提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world
applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in
generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference. Multi-agent
systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution,
enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing
these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt
engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and
limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent
policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL
algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on
Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase
computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical
Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group
Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy
updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of
rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability
and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group
rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and
effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate
that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and
computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential
for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.

Result: 实验表明，WeightLoRA显著减少参数数量，同时性能优于或与现有方法相当，WeightLoRA+表现更优。

Conclusion: WeightLoRA是一种高效且性能优越的参数高效微调方法。

Abstract: The widespread utilization of language models in modern applications is
inconceivable without Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques, such as
low-rank adaptation ($\texttt{LoRA}$), which adds trainable adapters to
selected layers. Although $\texttt{LoRA}$ may obtain accurate solutions, it
requires significant memory to train large models and intuition on which layers
to add adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\texttt{WeightLoRA}$, which overcomes this issue by adaptive selection of the
most critical $\texttt{LoRA}$ heads throughout the optimization process. As a
result, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while
maintaining the capability to obtain consistent or even superior metric values.
We conduct experiments for a series of competitive benchmarks and DeBERTa,
BART, and Llama models, comparing our method with different adaptive
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of
$\texttt{WeightLoRA}$ and the superior performance of $\texttt{WeightLoRA+}$ in
almost all cases.

Conclusion: 新正则化方法适用于多数TDB模型，能有效减少过拟合，提升性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) can be framed as a 3-order binary tensor
completion task. Tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models have demonstrated
strong performance in KGC. In this paper, we provide a summary of existing TDB
models and derive a general form for them, serving as a foundation for further
exploration of TDB models. Despite the expressiveness of TDB models, they are
prone to overfitting. Existing regularization methods merely minimize the norms
of embeddings to regularize the model, leading to suboptimal performance.
Therefore, we propose a novel regularization method for TDB models that
addresses this limitation. The regularization is applicable to most TDB models
and ensures tractable computation. Our method minimizes the norms of
intermediate variables involved in the different ways of computing the
predicted tensor. To support our regularization method, we provide a
theoretical analysis that proves its effect in promoting low trace norm of the
predicted tensor to reduce overfitting. Finally, we conduct experiments to
verify the effectiveness of our regularization technique as well as the
reliability of our theoretical analysis. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了表格异常检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection, which aims at identifying deviant samples, has
been crucial in a variety of real-world applications, such as medical disease
identification, financial fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, etc. Although
recent deep learning-based methods have achieved competitive performances,
these methods suffer from representation entanglement and the lack of global
correlation modeling, which hinders anomaly detection performance. To tackle
the problem, we incorporate mask modeling and prototype learning into tabular
anomaly detection. The core idea is to design learnable masks by disentangled
representation learning within a projection space and extracting normal
dependencies as explicit global prototypes. Specifically, the overall model
involves two parts: (i) During encoding, we perform mask modeling in both the
data space and projection space with orthogonal basis vectors for learning
shared disentangled normal patterns; (ii) During decoding, we decode multiple
masked representations in parallel for reconstruction and learn association
prototypes to extract normal characteristic correlations. Our proposal derives
from a distribution-matching perspective, where both projection space learning
and association prototype learning are formulated as optimal transport
problems, and the calibration distances are utilized to refine the anomaly
scores. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 20 tabular benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model.

Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control (MC-PILCO), a state-of-the-art

Abstract: Handling imbalanced target distributions in regression tasks remains a
significant challenge in tabular data settings where underrepresented regions
can hinder model performance. Among data-level solutions, some proposals, such
as random sampling and SMOTE-based approaches, propose adapting classification
techniques to regression tasks. However, these methods typically rely on crisp,
artificial thresholds over the target variable, a limitation inherited from
classification settings that can introduce arbitrariness, often leading to
non-intuitive and potentially misleading problem formulations. While recent
generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, provide flexible sample synthesis,
they come with high computational costs and limited interpretability. In this
study, we propose adapting an existing CART-based synthetic data generation
method, tailoring it for imbalanced regression. The new method integrates
relevance and density-based mechanisms to guide sampling in sparse regions of
the target space and employs a threshold-free, feature-driven generation
process. Our experimental study focuses on the prediction of extreme target
values across benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method
is competitive with other resampling and generative strategies in terms of
performance, while offering faster execution and greater transparency. These
results highlight the method's potential as a transparent, scalable data-level
strategy for improving regression models in imbalanced domains.

Conclusion: DSNN通过引入方向性信息，显著提升了SNN的性能。

Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a powerful generalization of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) that significantly improve our ability to model complex
relational data. While directionality has been shown to substantially boost
performance in graph learning tasks and is key to many real-world applications,
existing SNNs fall short in representing it. To address this limitation, we
introduce the Directed Cellular Sheaf, a special type of cellular sheaf
designed to explicitly account for edge orientation. Building on this
structure, we define a new sheaf Laplacian, the Directed Sheaf Laplacian, which
captures both the graph's topology and its directional information. This
operator serves as the backbone of the Directed Sheaf Neural Network (DSNN),
the first SNN model to embed a directional bias into its architecture.
Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmarks show that DSNN consistently
outperforms baseline methods.

Result: 实验证明BNPO在推理任务上达到最优性能，理论分析显示其能降低梯度估计方差。

Conclusion: BNPO通过自适应奖励归一化提升了训练稳定性，适用于复杂奖励系统。

Abstract: Recent studies, including DeepSeek-R1 and Kimi-k1.5, have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with rule-based, binary-valued reward functions can
significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
These models primarily utilize REINFORCE-based policy optimization techniques,
such as REINFORCE with baseline and group relative policy optimization (GRPO).
However, a key limitation remains: current policy optimization methods either
neglect reward normalization or employ static normalization strategies, which
fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of policy updates during training. This may
result in unstable gradient estimates and hinder training stability. To address
this issue, we propose Beta Normalization Policy Optimization (BNPO), a novel
policy optimization method that adaptively normalizes rewards using a Beta
distribution with dynamically updated parameters. BNPO aligns the normalization
with the changing policy distribution, enabling more precise and lower-variance
gradient estimation, which in turn promotes stable training dynamics. We
provide theoretical analysis demonstrating BNPO's variance-reducing properties
and show that it generalizes both REINFORCE and GRPO under binary-valued reward
settings. Furthermore, we introduce an advantage decomposition mechanism to
extend BNPO's applicability to more complex reward systems. Experimental
results confirm that BNPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among policy
optimization methods on reasoning tasks. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多假设客户端完全参与，而实际场景中部分参与更为常见，却缺乏系统研究。

Result: 提供了对现有方法的全面分析，揭示了其优缺点。

Conclusion: 部分客户端参与是联邦学习的重要挑战，需进一步研究以优化方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a learning mechanism that falls under the
distributed training umbrella, which collaboratively trains a shared global
model without disclosing the raw data from different clients. This paper
presents an extensive survey on the impact of partial client participation in
federated learning. While much of the existing research focuses on addressing
issues such as generalization, robustness, and fairness caused by data
heterogeneity under the assumption of full client participation, limited
attention has been given to the practical and theoretical challenges arising
from partial client participation, which is common in real-world scenarios.
This survey provides an in-depth review of existing FL methods designed to cope
with partial client participation. We offer a comprehensive analysis supported
by theoretical insights and empirical findings, along with a structured
categorization of these methods, highlighting their respective advantages and
disadvantages.

Result: 细粒度MoE在最大规模下表现出更优的验证损失和下游任务准确率。

Conclusion: 细粒度MoE为未来大规模模型开发提供了实用见解和实证基础。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as pivotal for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently. Fine-grained MoE approaches -
utilizing more numerous, smaller experts - have demonstrated potential in
improving model convergence and quality. This work proposes a set of training
recipes and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of fine-grained MoE,
directly comparing its scaling properties against standard MoE configurations
for models with up to 56B total (17B active) parameters. We investigate
convergence speed, model performance on downstream benchmarks, and practical
training considerations across various setups. Overall, at the largest scale we
show that fine-grained MoE achieves better validation loss and higher accuracy
across a set of downstream benchmarks. This study offers empirical grounding
and practical insights for leveraging fine-grained MoE in the development of
future large-scale models.

Method: 采用动态非重叠聚类和方差最小化选择客户端的方法，结合Boltzmann探索策略。

Result: 在异构场景下，算法优于现有联邦学习方法，提供更准确结果和更快收敛。

Conclusion: 通过动态聚类和方差优化，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model
training, yet its practical strength is often undermined by client data
heterogeneity, which severely degrades model performance. This paper proposes
that data heterogeneity across clients' distributions can be effectively
addressed by adopting an approach inspired by opinion dynamics over temporal
social networks. We introduce \shortname (Federated Coalition Variance
Reduction with Boltzmann Exploration), a variance-reducing selection algorithm
in which (1) clients dynamically organize into non-overlapping clusters based
on asymptotic agreements, and (2) from each cluster, one client is selected to
minimize the expected variance of its model update. Our experiments show that
in heterogeneous scenarios our algorithm outperforms existing FL algorithms,
yielding more accurate results and faster convergence, validating the efficacy
of our approach.

Result: 在理论和实验中均优于UCB1和UCB-V，表现出更紧的遗憾界限和实际鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RAVEN-UCB在非静态环境中表现出色，兼具理论优势和实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is challenging in non-stationary
environments where reward distributions evolve dynamically. We introduce
RAVEN-UCB, a novel algorithm that combines theoretical rigor with practical
efficiency via variance-aware adaptation. It achieves tighter regret bounds
than UCB1 and UCB-V, with gap-dependent regret of order $K \sigma_{\max}^2 \log
T / \Delta$ and gap-independent regret of order $\sqrt{K T \log T}$. RAVEN-UCB
incorporates three innovations: (1) variance-driven exploration using
$\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}_k^2 / (N_k + 1)}$ in confidence bounds, (2) adaptive
control via $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 / \log(t + \epsilon)$, and (3) constant-time
recursive updates for efficiency. Experiments across non-stationary patterns -
distributional changes, periodic shifts, and temporary fluctuations - in
synthetic and logistics scenarios demonstrate its superiority over
state-of-the-art baselines, confirming theoretical and practical robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识蒸馏的多任务学习方法（MTL-KD），用于训练具有强泛化能力的重型解码器模型，以解决多任务神经组合优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的多任务方法只能在小规模问题上训练轻量解码器模型，泛化能力有限。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏将多个单任务模型的政策知识转移到单一重型解码器模型中，并引入随机重排序重构（R3C）推理策略。

Result: 在6个已知和10个未知的VRP变体上实验，模型在1000节点规模下表现优异，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: MTL-KD方法显著提升了多任务模型的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a
promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle
Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on
small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving
large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel
multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which
enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong
generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge
from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder
model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's
generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a
flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C),
which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the
performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10
unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method
consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world
benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PAMM的张量压缩技术，显著减少注意力层中Q、K、V投影的内存占用，同时保持或提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注近似点积计算，而忽略了Q、K、V投影的内存消耗问题。

Method: 提出Point-Approximate Matrix Multiplication (PAMM)，通过张量压缩技术减少内存占用。

Result: PAMM能将内存消耗降低高达512倍，同时保持或提升最终困惑度。

Conclusion: PAMM是一种实用且互补的方法，可与高效注意力技术（如FlashAttention）结合使用，实现内存高效的LLM训练。

Abstract: The Multi-Head Attention mechanism is central to LLM operation, and multiple
works target its compute and memory efficiency during training. While most
works focus on approximating the scaled dot product, the memory consumption of
the linear projections that compute the $Q$, $K$, and $V$ tensors from the
input $x$ is often overlooked. To address this, we propose Point-Approximate
Matrix Multiplication (PAMM), a novel tensor compression technique that reduces
memory consumption of the $Q,K,V$ projections in attention layers by a factor
of up to $\times 512$, effectively erasing their memory footprint, while
achieving similar or better final perplexity. PAMM is fully composable with
efficient attention techniques such as FlashAttention, making it a practical
and complementary method for memory-efficient LLM training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“抽象反事实”的框架，用于解决语言模型（LM）代理中反事实推理的挑战，避免了传统基于标记的方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于标记的反事实方法在处理LM代理时存在不足，因为LM代理的动作空间开放且难以定义，标记的含义也随上下文变化，容易产生偏差或无意义的反事实。

Method: 提出“抽象反事实”框架，强调动作和交互的高层特征，结合用户相关特征进行反事实推理。实验包括文本游戏和反事实文本生成，同时考虑了标记级和潜在空间的干预。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成一致且有意义的反事实，同时最小化了标记级方法的副作用。

Conclusion: 抽象反事实框架为LM代理的反事实推理提供了更有效的解决方案，适用于开放动作空间和复杂上下文环境。

Abstract: Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool for analysing and evaluating
autonomous agents, but its application to language model (LM) agents remains
challenging. Existing work on counterfactuals in LMs has primarily focused on
token-level counterfactuals, which are often inadequate for LM agents due to
their open-ended action spaces. Unlike traditional agents with fixed, clearly
defined action spaces, the actions of LM agents are often implicit in the
strings they output, making their action spaces difficult to define and
interpret. Furthermore, the meanings of individual tokens can shift depending
on the context, adding complexity to token-level reasoning and sometimes
leading to biased or meaningless counterfactuals. We introduce \emph{Abstract
Counterfactuals}, a framework that emphasises high-level characteristics of
actions and interactions within an environment, enabling counterfactual
reasoning tailored to user-relevant features. Our experiments demonstrate that
the approach produces consistent and meaningful counterfactuals while
minimising the undesired side effects of token-level methods. We conduct
experiments on text-based games and counterfactual text generation, while
considering both token-level and latent-space interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为交互场匹配（IFM）的新方法，作为静电匹配（EFM）的扩展，解决了EFM中建模复杂静电场的问题，并通过物理启发的强相互作用场设计提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静电匹配（EFM）在数据生成和传输中表现出潜力，但建模复杂静电场的挑战限制了其应用。本文旨在通过引入更通用的交互场来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了交互场匹配（IFM），扩展了EFM的框架，允许使用非静电的通用交互场，并设计了一种基于强相互作用的物理场实现。

Result: 在玩具和图像数据传输问题上展示了IFM的性能，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: IFM不仅解决了EFM的局限性，还通过物理启发的设计提升了数据生成和传输的效果。

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel
physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an
electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using
neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into
account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we
propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows
using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore,
inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we
design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems
which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance
on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

TL;DR: PC-MoE是一种隐私保护的协作式混合专家模型，通过稀疏性实现高效内存的分布式LLM训练，同时保护数据隐私，性能接近集中式模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参与方在有限GPU内存和数据资源下协作训练更强大LLM的需求，同时保护训练数据隐私。

Method: 利用MoE架构的稀疏性，将训练数据、部分前向信号和梯度保留在本地，实现分布式计算与隐私保护的结合。

Result: 在七个LLM基准测试中，性能接近集中式模型，GPU内存峰值降低70%，且完全抵御重构攻击。

Conclusion: PC-MoE打破了隐私保护与任务准确性之间的权衡，为协作训练提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful
adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce
Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages
the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized
collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory
and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could
achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data
privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the
forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE
synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong
confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay
for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that
trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and
sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized
model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against
reconstruction attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算和通信高效的在线空中联邦学习算法（2CEOAFL），用于处理空中连接车辆（ACV）的持续数据流和资源限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空中连接车辆（ACV）的持续数据流和资源限制需要高效的机器学习解决方案，同时保护隐私。

Method: 通过建模ACV的轨迹，提出2CEOAFL算法，包括模型剪枝、训练和概率量化梯度卸载。

Result: 仿真结果表明，2CEOAFL在性能上与计算和通信效率较低的非剪枝和非量化版本相当。

Conclusion: 2CEOAFL算法在资源受限的ACV环境中实现了高效的分布式机器学习。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected
vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately.
Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their
trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online
learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical
ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and
communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a
computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning
(2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited
onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned
ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories
according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose
a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense
ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c)
probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to
the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the
proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned
and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient
counterparts.

Motivation: 尽管表格FM（如TabPFN和TabICL）在无梯度更新或微调的情况下表现优异，但其对抗性鲁棒性尚未被充分探索。

Method: 论文通过测试时攻击和对抗性工具滥用研究表格FM的脆弱性，并提出两种改进方法：对抗性微调和对抗性上下文学习。

Conclusion: 表格FM既是攻击目标也是攻击来源，强调了在这一新兴范式中加强鲁棒性训练和评估的紧迫性。

Abstract: Recent tabular Foundational Models (FM) such as TabPFN and TabICL, leverage
in-context learning to achieve strong performance without gradient updates or
fine-tuning. However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the
adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to
targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We
show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small,
structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction
accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate
that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to
conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent
to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification
problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the
context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context
adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with
adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach
improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these
findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial
threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation
practices in this emerging paradigm.

Conclusion: 该研究为自监督神经网络在逆问题中的应用提供了理论支持，展示了惯性算法的有效性。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with neural networks benefits from very few
theoretical guarantees when it comes to the recovery guarantees. We provide in
this work convergence and recovery guarantees for self-supervised neural
networks applied to inverse problems, such as Deep Image/Inverse Prior, and
trained with inertia featuring both viscous and geometric Hessian-driven
dampings. We study both the continuous-time case, i.e., the trajectory of a
dynamical system, and the discrete case leading to an inertial algorithm with
an adaptive step-size. We show in the continuous-time case that the network can
be trained with an optimal accelerated exponential convergence rate compared to
the rate obtained with gradient flow. We also show that training a network with
our inertial algorithm enjoys similar recovery guarantees though with a less
sharp linear convergence rate.

Result: 在CATH 4.2测试集上，DPO微调将平均TM-Score从0.77提升至0.81，迭代应用后提升达79.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过偏好优化从结构反馈中增强蛋白质序列设计能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The inverse folding problem, aiming to design amino acid sequences that fold
into desired three-dimensional structures, is pivotal for various
biotechnological applications. Here, we introduce a novel approach leveraging
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune an inverse folding model
using feedback from a protein folding model. Given a target protein structure,
we begin by sampling candidate sequences from the inverse-folding model, then
predict the three-dimensional structure of each sequence with the folding model
to generate pairwise structural-preference labels. These labels are used to
fine-tune the inverse-folding model under the DPO objective. Our results on the
CATH 4.2 test set demonstrate that DPO fine-tuning not only improves sequence
recovery of baseline models but also leads to a significant improvement in
average TM-Score from 0.77 to 0.81, indicating enhanced structure similarity.
Furthermore, iterative application of our DPO-based method on challenging
protein structures yields substantial gains, with an average TM-Score increase
of 79.5\% with regard to the baseline model. This work establishes a promising
direction for enhancing protein sequence design ability from structure feedback
by effectively utilizing preference optimization.

Conclusion: 通过标准化和明确可信赖UQ的维度，可以更好地设计和评估不确定性感知的机器学习系统。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainties for machine learning (ML) models is a foundational
challenge in modern data analysis. This challenge is compounded by at least two
key aspects of the field: (a) inconsistent terminology surrounding uncertainty
and estimation across disciplines, and (b) the varying technical requirements
for establishing trustworthy uncertainties in diverse problem contexts. In this
position paper, we aim to clarify the depth of these challenges by identifying
these inconsistencies and articulating how different contexts impose distinct
epistemic demands. We examine the current landscape of estimation targets
(e.g., prediction, inference, simulation-based inference), uncertainty
constructs (e.g., frequentist, Bayesian, fiducial), and the approaches used to
map between them. Drawing on the literature, we highlight and explain examples
of problematic mappings. To help address these issues, we advocate for
standards that promote alignment between the \textit{intent} and
\textit{implementation} of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. We
discuss several axes of trustworthiness that are necessary (if not sufficient)
for reliable UQ in ML models, and show how these axes can inform the design and
evaluation of uncertainty-aware ML systems. Our practical recommendations focus
on scientific ML, offering illustrative cases and use scenarios, particularly
in the context of simulation-based inference (SBI).

Abstract: We address the problem of Schr\"odinger potential estimation, which plays a
crucial role in modern generative modelling approaches based on Schr\"odinger
bridges and stochastic optimal control for SDEs. Given a simple prior diffusion
process, these methods search for a path between two given distributions
$\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ requiring minimal efforts. The optimal drift in this
case can be expressed through a Schr\"odinger potential. In the present paper,
we study generalization ability of an empirical Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk
minimizer over a class of admissible log-potentials aimed at fitting the
marginal distribution at time $T$. Under reasonable assumptions on the target
distribution $\rho_T^*$ and the prior process, we derive a non-asymptotic
high-probability upper bound on the KL-divergence between $\rho_T^*$ and the
terminal density corresponding to the estimated log-potential. In particular,
we show that the excess KL-risk may decrease as fast as $O(\log^2 n / n)$ when
the sample size $n$ tends to infinity even if both $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ have
unbounded supports.

Motivation: 传统A/B测试在多候选和多指标场景下统计功效不足，而自适应实验设计（AED）又难以推断实验统计量（如平均处理效应）。

Method: 提出SHRVar方法，结合相对方差采样和奖励z值淘汰策略，扩展了序贯减半（SH）和SHVar方法，适用于异方差场景。

Result: 理论证明其错误概率呈指数下降，数值实验验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在多指标和异方差场景下表现优异，为在线实验提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Standard A/B tests in online experiments face statistical power challenges
when testing multiple candidates simultaneously, while adaptive experimental
designs (AED) alone fall short in inferring experiment statistics such as the
average treatment effect, especially with many metrics (e.g., revenue, safety)
and heterogeneous variances. This paper proposes a fixed-budget multi-metric
AED framework with a two-phase structure: an adaptive exploration phase to
identify the best treatment, and a validation phase with an A/B test to verify
the treatment's quality and infer statistics. We propose SHRVar, which
generalizes sequential halving (SH) (Karnin et al., 2013) with a novel
relative-variance-based sampling and an elimination strategy built on reward
z-values. It achieves a provable error probability that decreases
exponentially, where the exponent generalizes the complexity measure for SH
(Karnin et al., 2013) and SHVar (Lalitha et al., 2023) with homogeneous and
heterogeneous variances, respectively. Numerical experiments verify our

### [313] [Provable Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with an Unknown Link Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03066)
*Qining Zhang,Lei Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了RLHF问题中未知链接函数的情况，提出了一种基于零阶策略优化的新算法ZSPO，通过估计价值函数差异的符号而非梯度，避免了链接函数误设问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF算法假设链接函数已知，但人类偏好的复杂性使得这种假设不现实。本文旨在解决链接函数未知的问题。

Method: 提出ZSPO算法，利用人类偏好构造与真实策略梯度方向正相关的参数更新方向，无需知道链接函数。

Result: 在温和条件下，ZSPO以多项式收敛率收敛到平稳策略，数值结果显示了其在链接函数不匹配时的优越性。

Conclusion: ZSPO是一种有效的RLHF算法，适用于链接函数未知的场景，具有理论和实际优势。

Abstract: Link functions, which characterize how human preferences are generated from
the value function of an RL problem, are a crucial component in designing RLHF
algorithms. Almost all RLHF algorithms, including state-of-the-art ones in
empirical studies such as DPO and PPO, assume the link function is known to the
agent (e.g., a logistic function according to the Bradley-Terry model), which
is arguably unrealistic considering the complex nature of human preferences. To
avoid link function mis-specification, this paper studies general RLHF problems
with unknown link functions. We propose a novel policy optimization algorithm
called ZSPO based on a new zeroth-order policy optimization method, where the
key is to use human preference to construct a parameter update direction that
is positively correlated with the true policy gradient direction. ZSPO achieves
it by estimating the sign of the value function difference instead of
estimating the gradient from the value function difference, so it does not
require knowing the link function. Under mild conditions, ZSPO converges to a
stationary policy with a polynomial convergence rate depending on the number of
policy iterations and trajectories per iteration. Numerical results also show
the superiority of ZSPO under link function mismatch.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of learning in the presence of an adversary that can
corrupt an $\eta$ fraction of the training examples with the goal of causing
failure on a specific test point. In the realizable setting, prior work
established that the optimal error under such instance-targeted poisoning
attacks scales as $\Theta(d\eta)$, where $d$ is the VC dimension of the
hypothesis class arXiv:2210.02713. In this work, we resolve the corresponding
question in the agnostic setting. We show that the optimal excess error is
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\eta})$, answering one of the main open problems left by
Hanneke et al. To achieve this rate, it is necessary to use randomized
learners: Hanneke et al. showed that deterministic learners can be forced to
suffer error close to 1, even under small amounts of poisoning. Perhaps
surprisingly, our upper bound remains valid even when the learner's random bits
are fully visible to the adversary . In the other direction, our lower bound is
stronger than standard PAC-style bounds: instead of tailoring a hard
distribution separately for each sample size, we exhibit a single fixed
distribution under which the adversary can enforce an excess error of
$\Omega(\sqrt{d\eta})$ infinitely often.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StreamBP是一种内存高效且精确的反向传播方法，通过序列维度的线性分解显著减少激活值和logits的内存开销，适用于SFT、GRPO和DPO等常见目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列训练语言模型对复杂任务（如长链推理）至关重要，但传统反向传播方法在长序列下内存开销巨大。

Method: 提出StreamBP，通过层级的序列维度线性分解减少内存开销，并利用语言模型的因果结构降低计算FLOPs和加速反向传播。

Result: StreamBP将反向传播的最大序列长度扩展了2.8-5.5倍，同时保持或减少反向传播时间。

Conclusion: StreamBP适用于多GPU训练，可轻松集成到任何Transformer模型的训练流程中。

Abstract: Training language models on long sequence data is a demanding requirement for
enhancing the model's capability on complex tasks, e.g., long-chain reasoning.
However, as the sequence length scales up, the memory cost for storing
activation values becomes huge during the Backpropagation (BP) process, even
with the application of gradient checkpointing technique. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a memory-efficient and exact BP method called StreamBP,
which performs a linear decomposition of the chain rule along the sequence
dimension in a layer-wise manner, significantly reducing the memory cost of
activation values and logits. The proposed method is applicable to common
objectives such as SFT, GRPO, and DPO. From an implementation perspective,
StreamBP achieves less computational FLOPs and faster BP speed by leveraging
the causal structure of the language model. Compared to gradient checkpointing,
StreamBP scales up the maximum sequence length of BP by 2.8-5.5 times larger,
while using comparable or even less BP time. Note that StreamBP's sequence
length scaling ability can be directly transferred to batch size scaling for
accelerating training. We further develop a communication-efficient distributed
StreamBP to effectively support multi-GPU training and broaden its
applicability. Our code can be easily integrated into the training pipeline of
any transformer models and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/StreamBP.

Motivation: 研究学习算法在训练集以外的更长输入上的泛化能力。

Method: 形式化非渐近长度泛化框架，分析不同函数类的长度复杂度，包括最小复杂度插值算法、上下文无关文法和确定性有限自动机。

Result: 证明了确定性有限自动机的长度复杂度为2n-2，C-RASP函数类的长度复杂度分别为O(T^2)和O(T^{O(K)})。

Conclusion: 长度泛化与语言等价问题的可判定性相关，某些函数类（如上下文无关文法）无法计算长度复杂度的上界。

Abstract: Length generalization is the ability of a learning algorithm to learn a
hypothesis which generalizes to longer inputs than the inputs in the training
set. In this paper, we provide provable guarantees of length generalization for
various classes of functions in an idealized setting. First, we formalize the
framework of non-asymptotic length generalization, which requires a computable
upper bound for the minimum input length that guarantees length generalization,
as a function of the complexity of ground-truth function under some given
complexity measure. We refer to this minimum input length to length generalize
as length complexity. We show the Minimum-Complexity Interpolator learning
algorithm achieves optimal length complexity. We further show that whether a
function class admits non-asymptotic length generalization is equivalent to the
decidability of its language equivalence problem, which implies that there is
no computable upper bound for the length complexity of Context-Free Grammars.
On the positive side, we show that the length complexity of Deterministic
Finite Automata is $2n - 2$ where $n$ is the number of states of the
ground-truth automaton. Our main results are upper bounds of length complexity
for a subset of a transformer-related function class called C-RASP (Yang &
Chiang, 2024). We show that the length complexity of 1-layer C-RASP functions
is $O(T^2)$ when the ground-truth function has precision $T$, and that the
length complexity of 2-layer C-RASP functions is $O(T^{O(K)})$ when the
ground-truth function has precision $T$ and $K$ heads.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for analyzing
graph-structured data in domains such as drug discovery and financial analysis,
leading to growing demands for model transparency. Recent advances in
explainable GNNs have addressed this need by revealing important subgraphs that
influence predictions, but these explanation mechanisms may inadvertently
expose models to security risks. This paper investigates how such explanations
potentially leak critical decision logic that can be exploited for model
stealing. We propose {\method}, a novel stealing framework that integrates
explanation alignment for capturing decision logic with guided data
augmentation for efficient training under limited queries, enabling effective
replication of both the predictive behavior and underlying reasoning patterns
of target models. Experiments on molecular graph datasets demonstrate that our
approach shows advantages over conventional methods in model stealing. This
work highlights important security considerations for the deployment of
explainable GNNs in sensitive domains and suggests the need for protective
measures against explanation-based attacks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机是验证神经网络表示是否包含非线性、层次化特征，并探讨稀疏自编码器（SAE）是否能捕捉这些特征。

Method: 提出了一种基于匹配追踪（MP）算法的MP-SAE方法，通过逐步残差引导捕捉非线性、层次化特征。

Result: 实验表明，MP-SAE能有效捕捉条件正交特征和非线性特征，揭示了视觉-语言模型中共享结构。

Conclusion: 结论是解释性方法应从表示的现象学出发，MP-SAE为捕捉复杂特征提供了新思路。

Abstract: Motivated by the hypothesis that neural network representations encode
abstract, interpretable features as linearly accessible, approximately
orthogonal directions, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a popular tool in
interpretability. However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model
representations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing
signatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This
raises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds
with their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help
identify said features and gain further insights into neural network
representations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based
approach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from
sparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a
sequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and
nonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs
on a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical
concepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are
unable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE
recovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the
seemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a
vision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features
are solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the
sequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of
adaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest.
Overall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that
interpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with
methods emerging from assumptions that fit it.

Method: 将检索文本视为查询相关的噪声上下文示例，构建框架分析RAG的泛化界，并引入均匀和非均匀RAG噪声模型。

Result: 理论分析表明RAG存在泛化误差上限，并通过实验验证了ICL和RAG在常见QA基准上的样本效率。

Conclusion: 本文为RAG提供了理论支持，揭示了其与ICL的差异及其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in
recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its
theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose
the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear
regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the
retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the
classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our
analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on
RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model
retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing
uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample
efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks,
such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有W2SG方法需要额外弱模型或复杂流程，导致计算和内存开销大，而$f$-散度在机器学习中表现优异，因此引入其作为损失函数框架。

Method: 使用$f$-散度作为信息理论损失函数，理论分析了其在W2SG中的局限性和等价性，并提供了样本复杂度界限和信息理论见解。

Result: 实验证明$f$-散度损失（如KL散度）能有效提升强模型的泛化能力和噪声容忍度。

Conclusion: $f$-散度损失为W2SG提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
stimulating the capabilities of strong pre-trained models by leveraging
supervision from weaker supervisors. To improve the performance of the strong
model, existing methods often require additional weak models or complex
procedures, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. Motivated
by the effectiveness of $f$-divergence loss in various machine learning
domains, we introduce $f$-divergence as an information-theoretic loss function
framework in W2SG. Our theoretical analysis reveals fundamental limitations and
equivalence of different $f$-divergence losses in W2SG, supported by sample
complexity bounds and information-theoretic insights. We empirically
demonstrate that $f$-divergence loss, which generalizes widely-used metrics
like KL divergence, effectively improves generalization and noise tolerance of
the strong model in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体流动的统计建模因多尺度动态和初始条件敏感性而极具挑战性，现有扩散模型需要大量采样步骤。

Method: 引入修正流框架，学习时间依赖的速度场，沿近乎直线轨迹传输输入到输出分布，将采样转化为ODE求解。

Result: 实验表明，修正流在8步内即可达到与128步扩散模型相同的后验分布，且保留细尺度特征，推理时间大幅缩短。

Conclusion: 修正流框架在高效性和保真度上均优于传统扩散模型，适用于多尺度流动建模。

Abstract: The statistical modeling of fluid flows is very challenging due to their
multiscale dynamics and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. While
recently proposed conditional diffusion models achieve high fidelity, they
typically require hundreds of stochastic sampling steps at inference. We
introduce a rectified flow framework that learns a time-dependent velocity
field, transporting input to output distributions along nearly straight
trajectories. By casting sampling as solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) along this straighter flow field, our method makes each integration step
much more effective, using as few as eight steps versus (more than) 128 steps
in standard score-based diffusion, without sacrificing predictive fidelity.
Experiments on challenging multiscale flow benchmarks show that rectified flows
recover the same posterior distributions as diffusion models, preserve
fine-scale features that MSE-trained baselines miss, and deliver
high-resolution samples in a fraction of inference time.

Abstract: Pretrained time series models, capable of zero-shot forecasting, have
demonstrated significant potential in enhancing both the performance and
accessibility of time series forecasting. However, existing pretrained models
either do not support covariates or fail to incorporate them effectively. We
introduce COSMIC, a zero-shot forecasting model that utilizes covariates via
in-context learning. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose
Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC
without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without
covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC
effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.

Motivation: 大模型低秩适应中存在稳定秩低于子空间线性代数秩的问题，导致微调性能下降。

Method: 提出PoLAR方法，将低秩更新分解为两个受限于Stiefel流形的方向矩阵和一个无约束的尺度矩阵。

Result: 理论证明PoLAR在典型低秩适应问题上具有指数级更快的收敛速度，实验在三个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: PoLAR通过极分解参数化和黎曼优化，显著提升了低秩适应的性能。

Abstract: We show that low-rank adaptation of large-scale models suffers from a low
stable rank that is well below the linear algebraic rank of the subspace,
degrading fine-tuning performance. To mitigate the underutilization of the
allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar
decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices
constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory
shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical
low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian
optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing
general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem
solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.

Motivation: LLMs在预训练过程中会记忆不需要的信息（如隐私或受版权保护的内容），引发隐私和法律问题。现有遗忘方法存在过度遗忘问题，导致模型效用下降。

Method: TIF框架包括目标信息标识器和目标偏好优化方法，通过区分不需要的单词（UW）和一般单词（GW），分别应用Logit Preference Loss和Preservation Loss来优化遗忘过程。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，TIF框架显著提升了遗忘效果，同时保持了模型效用，取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: TIF框架有效解决了LLMs中信息遗忘的挑战，为隐私保护和法律合规提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on massive text corpora, exhibit
remarkable human-level language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making
abilities. However, they tend to memorize unwanted information, such as private
or copyrighted content, raising significant privacy and legal concerns.
Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, but existing methods face a
significant challenge of over-forgetting. This issue arises because they
indiscriminately suppress the generation of all the tokens in forget samples,
leading to a substantial loss of model utility. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce the Targeted Information Forgetting (TIF) framework, which consists
of (1) a flexible targeted information identifier designed to differentiate
between unwanted words (UW) and general words (GW) in the forget samples, and
(2) a novel Targeted Preference Optimization approach that leverages Logit
Preference Loss to unlearn unwanted information associated with UW and
Preservation Loss to retain general information in GW, effectively improving
the unlearning process while mitigating utility degradation. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TIF
framework enhances unlearning effectiveness while preserving model utility and
achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing
and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the
classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of
training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or
unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading
to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used
in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of
diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored
in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory
retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong
memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction
around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the
critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where
an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new
attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples.
Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to
emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the
same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings
provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in
diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of
spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used
diffusion models.

Abstract: The de novo generation of drug-like molecules capable of inducing desirable
phenotypic changes is receiving increasing attention. However, previous methods
predominantly rely on expression profiles to guide molecule generation, but
overlook the perturbative effect of the molecules on cellular contexts. To
overcome this limitation, we propose SmilesGEN, a novel generative model based
on variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to generate molecules with
potential therapeutic effects. SmilesGEN integrates a pre-trained drug VAE
(SmilesNet) with an expression profile VAE (ProfileNet), jointly modeling the
interplay between drug perturbations and transcriptional responses in a common
latent space. Specifically, ProfileNet is imposed to reconstruct pre-treatment
expression profiles when eliminating drug-induced perturbations in the latent
space, while SmilesNet is informed by desired expression profiles to generate
drug-like molecules. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that SmilesGEN
outperforms current state-of-the-art models in generating molecules with higher
degree of validity, uniqueness, novelty, as well as higher Tanimoto similarity
to known ligands targeting the relevant proteins. Moreover, we evaluate
SmilesGEN for scaffold-based molecule optimization and generation of
therapeutic agents, and confirmed its superior performance in generating
molecules with higher similarity to approved drugs. SmilesGEN establishes a
robust framework that leverages gene signatures to generate drug-like molecules
that hold promising potential to induce desirable cellular phenotypic changes.

Abstract: Recently, extensive deep learning architectures and pretraining strategies
have been explored to support downstream protein applications. Additionally,
domain-specific models incorporating biological knowledge have been developed
to enhance performance in specialized tasks. In this work, we introduce
$\textbf{Protap}$, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically compares
backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and domain-specific models
across diverse and realistic downstream protein applications. Specifically,
Protap covers five applications: three general tasks and two novel specialized
tasks, i.e., enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage site prediction and targeted
protein degradation, which are industrially relevant yet missing from existing
benchmarks. For each application, Protap compares various domain-specific
models and general architectures under multiple pretraining settings. Our
empirical studies imply that: (i) Though large-scale pretraining encoders
achieve great results, they often underperform supervised encoders trained on
small downstream training sets. (ii) Incorporating structural information
during downstream fine-tuning can match or even outperform protein language
models pretrained on large-scale sequence corpora. (iii) Domain-specific
biological priors can enhance performance on specialized downstream tasks. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种数据驱动建模方法，用于直接从频域数据构建具有二阶微分结构的动态系统，并扩展了经典的Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动建模方法在构建动态系统时往往忽略物理现象的微分结构，导致模型难以从物理意义上解释。

Method: 基于二阶结构化的重心形式，扩展Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson算法，提出两种变体以平衡计算速度和建模精度。

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在建模精度和性能上优于传统的非结构化数据驱动建模。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了动态系统建模中微分结构缺失的问题，为物理现象的数据驱动建模提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: The data-driven modeling of dynamical systems has become an essential tool
for the construction of accurate computational models from real-world data. In
this process, the inherent differential structures underlying the considered
physical phenomena are often neglected making the reinterpretation of the
learned models in a physically meaningful sense very challenging. In this work,
we present three data-driven modeling approaches for the construction of
dynamical systems with second-order differential structure directly from
frequency domain data. Based on the second-order structured barycentric form,
we extend the well-known Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm to the case of
second-order systems. Depending on the available computational resources, we
propose variations of the proposed method that prioritize either higher
computation speed or greater modeling accuracy, and we present a theoretical
analysis for the expected accuracy and performance of the proposed methods.
Three numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new structured
approaches in comparison to classical unstructured data-driven modeling.

TL;DR: SA-Radar是一种雷达模拟方法，结合生成式和物理模拟，通过波形参数化属性嵌入实现可控高效的雷达立方体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有雷达模拟方法在可控性和效率上的不足，支持多样化的传感器设置和场景需求。

Method: 设计ICFAR-Net（基于波形参数的条件3D U-Net），通过混合真实-模拟数据集训练网络。

Result: 模拟数据在多种下游任务（如目标检测和语义分割）中表现真实且有效，显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: SA-Radar可作为自动驾驶雷达数据的通用引擎，支持新视角和场景编辑。

Abstract: We present SA-Radar (Simulate Any Radar), a radar simulation approach that
enables controllable and efficient generation of radar cubes conditioned on
customizable radar attributes. Unlike prior generative or physics-based
simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized
attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar
attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations
induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need
for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of
range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further
construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly
train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including
2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that
SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently
improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real
data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and
edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine
for autonomous driving applications. Code and additional materials are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统递归最小二乘法无法提供参数和预测的不确定性信息，而贝叶斯方法能够量化这些不确定性并支持在线模型证据计算。

Method: 采用因子图消息传递技术，递归估计多变量自回归模型的自回归系数和噪声精度，并传播不确定性到预测中。

Result: 在合成自回归系统和双质量-弹簧-阻尼器系统上验证了方法的收敛性和竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效量化参数和预测的不确定性，适用于在线模型证据计算和实际系统建模。

Abstract: We propose a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for multivariate
autoregressive models with exogenous inputs based on message passing in a
factor graph. Unlike recursive least-squares, our method produces full
posterior distributions for both the autoregressive coefficients and noise
precision. The uncertainties regarding these estimates propagate into the
uncertainties on predictions for future system outputs, and support online
model evidence calculations. We demonstrate convergence empirically on a
synthetic autoregressive system and competitive performance on a double
mass-spring-damper system.

*Christian Marius Lillelund,Sanjay Kalra,Russell Greiner*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种预测ALS患者功能衰退时间的新方法，通过多事件生存模型分析五项功能，结果显示协变量模型优于Kaplan-Meier估计，并可进行个体化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALS是一种导致渐进性瘫痪的疾病，现有治疗难以确定最佳干预时机，需个性化预测方法。

Method: 将任务建模为多事件生存问题，使用PRO-ACT数据集训练五个协变量生存模型，预测个体生存分布（ISD）。

Result: 协变量模型优于Kaplan-Meier估计，发现Riluzole对功能衰退影响小，延髓起病ALS患者言语和吞咽功能衰退更快。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于临床数据评估功能衰退风险，支持个性化治疗计划。

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of motor
neurons that causes progressive paralysis in patients. Current treatment
options aim to prolong survival and improve quality of life; however, due to
the heterogeneity of the disease, it is often difficult to determine the
optimal time for potential therapies or medical interventions. In this study,
we propose a novel method to predict the time until a patient with ALS
experiences significant functional impairment (ALSFRS-R<=2) with respect to
five common functions: speaking, swallowing, handwriting, walking and
breathing. We formulate this task as a multi-event survival problem and
validate our approach in the PRO-ACT dataset by training five covariate-based
survival models to estimate the probability of an event over a 500-day period
after a baseline visit. We then predict five event-specific individual survival
distributions (ISDs) for each patient, each providing an interpretable and
meaningful estimate of when that event will likely take place in the future.
The results show that covariate-based models are superior to the Kaplan-Meier
estimator at predicting time-to-event outcomes. Additionally, our method
enables practitioners to make individual counterfactual predictions, where
certain features (covariates) can be changed to see their effect on the
predicted outcome. In this regard, we find that Riluzole has little to no
impact on predicted functional decline. However, for patients with bulbar-onset
ALS, our method predicts considerably shorter counterfactual time-to-event
estimates for tasks related to speech and swallowing compared to limb-onset
ALS. The proposed method can be applied to current clinical examination data to
assess the risk of functional decline and thus allow more personalized
treatment planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过多算法异常检测和选择性重实验提升数据集质量的方法，显著提高了聚合物材料性能预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决聚合物材料性能预测中因实验数据异常导致的机器学习模型偏差问题。

Method: 整合多算法异常检测与选择性重实验，构建包含701个测量值的新数据集，验证方法在多种机器学习模型中的效果。

Result: 方法显著降低了预测误差（RMSE），仅需重测约5%的数据即可显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 数据质量提升对聚合物科学中机器学习应用的可靠性至关重要，该方法为材料科学提供了一种可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven
approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant
experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in
empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to
erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently
by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective
re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical
effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset
containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass
transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density
($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance
improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net,
SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method
reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy
with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the
dataset to be re-measured.These findings highlight the importance of data
quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in
polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive
reliability in materials science.

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用大型语言模型（LLM）嵌入改进深度主动学习（AL）的实用性，发现嵌入质量和查询策略选择对性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用冻结的LLM嵌入，减少深度AL中迭代微调大型模型的成本，并研究嵌入质量对AL策略的影响。

Method: 使用MTEB排行榜上的五个高性能模型和两个基线模型，在十个文本分类任务中评估不同查询策略的效果。

Result: 多样性采样与高质量嵌入协同提升早期AL性能；嵌入质量影响最优策略选择，Badge策略更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AL策略的效果高度依赖嵌入质量和目标任务，需进行上下文特定评估。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of producing
general-purpose representations lets us revisit the practicality of deep active
learning (AL): By leveraging frozen LLM embeddings, we can mitigate the
computational costs of iteratively fine-tuning large backbones. This study
establishes a benchmark and systematically investigates the influence of LLM
embedding quality on query strategies in deep AL. We employ five top-performing
models from the massive text embedding benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard and two
baselines for ten diverse text classification tasks. Our findings reveal key
insights: First, initializing the labeled pool using diversity-based sampling
synergizes with high-quality embeddings, boosting performance in early AL
iterations. Second, the choice of the optimal query strategy is sensitive to
embedding quality. While the computationally inexpensive Margin sampling can
achieve performance spikes on specific datasets, we find that strategies like
Badge exhibit greater robustness across tasks. Importantly, their effectiveness
is often enhanced when paired with higher-quality embeddings. Our results
emphasize the need for context-specific evaluation of AL strategies, as
performance heavily depends on embedding quality and the target task.

Conclusion: FinS-Pilot为金融NLP系统研究提供了实用的评估框架和数据集，推动了该领域的进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated
through standardized benchmarks. However, the development of financial RAG
benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of
dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduces FinS-Pilot, a
novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications.
Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark
incorporates both real-time API data and structured text sources, organized
through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains
such as equity analysis and macroeconomic forecasting. The benchmark enables
comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both
static knowledge and time-sensitive market information. Through systematic
experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's
effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while
addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial
domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a
curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and
dataset are accessible on

TL;DR: 论文提出BranchLoRA框架，解决多模态持续指令调优中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MoELoRA）在多模态持续指令调优中易导致灾难性遗忘，且参数效率低。

Method: 提出BranchLoRA框架，采用非对称设计和调优-冻结机制，结合任务特定路由器和任务选择器。

Result: 实验表明BranchLoRA显著优于MoELoRA，并在不同规模MLLM中保持优势。

Conclusion: BranchLoRA有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，提升了多模态持续指令调优的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to finetune Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to continually align with human intent across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However,
these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all
LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In
this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA
framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose
BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance.
To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within
BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while
fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate
task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time,
rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we
introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the
appropriate router without requiring task identity. Extensive experiments on
the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that BranchLoRA significantly outperforms
MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across various MLLM sizes.

Motivation: 尽管ASR技术取得显著进展，但模型依赖的具体声学线索仍不明确。此前研究仅限于少量音素和过时模型。

Method: 应用特征归因技术，分析元音、摩擦音和爆破音的声学特性在时间和频率域中的表现。

Result: 模型更关注元音的整个时间跨度（特别是前两个共振峰）、摩擦音的频谱特性（尤其是擦音），以及爆破音的释放阶段（特别是爆破特性）。

Conclusion: 研究增强了ASR模型的可解释性，并指出了未来研究的方向，以揭示模型鲁棒性的潜在不足。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in ASR, the specific acoustic cues models rely
on remain unclear. Prior studies have examined such cues on a limited set of
phonemes and outdated models. In this work, we apply a feature attribution
technique to identify the relevant acoustic cues for a modern Conformer-based
ASR system. By analyzing plosives, fricatives, and vowels, we assess how
feature attributions align with their acoustic properties in the time and
frequency domains, also essential for human speech perception. Our findings
show that the ASR model relies on vowels' full time spans, particularly their
first two formants, with greater saliency in male speech. It also better
captures the spectral characteristics of sibilant fricatives than non-sibilants
and prioritizes the release phase in plosives, especially burst
characteristics. These insights enhance the interpretability of ASR models and
highlight areas for future research to uncover potential gaps in model
robustness.

LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery
of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action

LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena,
highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with
self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance
gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR
requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM

*Russell Scheinberg,Ameeta Agrawal,Amber Shore,So Young Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'grammar prompting'的方法，通过让大语言模型（LLM）首先生成语法规则的解释，再将解释作为额外上下文输入目标模型，显著提升了模型在判断句子可接受性时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）能够解释语法规则，但在实际判断句子可接受性时往往无法正确应用这些规则。本文旨在解决这一差距。

Method: 提出'grammar prompting'方法，即先让LLM生成语法现象的解释，再将解释作为上下文输入目标模型（LLM或小语言模型SLM），以判断句子是否合乎语法。

Result: 在多个语言基准测试中，该方法显著优于基线模型，缩小了LLM与SLM之间的性能差距，尤其在结合链式思考（chain-of-thought）时效果更佳。

Conclusion: 'grammar prompting'是一种轻量级、语言无关的方法，能够帮助低成本SLM在多语言环境中接近前沿LLM的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain grammatical rules, yet they often
fail to apply those rules when judging sentence acceptability. We present
"grammar prompting", an explain-then-process paradigm: a large LLM first
produces a concise explanation of the relevant syntactic phenomenon, then that
explanation is fed back as additional context to the target model -- either an
LLM or a smaller language model (SLM) -- before deciding which sentence of a
minimal pair is grammatical. On the English BLiMP, Chinese SLING, and Russian
RuBLiMP benchmarks, this simple prompt design yields substantial improvements
over strong baselines across many syntactic phenomena. Feeding an LLM's
metalinguistic explanation back to the target model bridges the gap between
knowing a rule and using it. On SLMs, grammar prompting alone trims the average
LLM-SLM accuracy gap by about 20%, and when paired with chain-of-thought, by
56% (13.0 pp -> 5.8 pp), all at negligible cost. The lightweight,
language-agnostic cue lets low-cost SLMs approach frontier-LLM performance in
multilingual settings.

TL;DR: TRuST数据集整合了现有数据，标注了毒性、目标社会群体和毒性片段，用于改进毒性检测。研究发现微调模型优于零样本和少样本提示，但某些社会群体表现仍不佳，且大语言模型的社会推理能力较弱。


<details>

Motivation: 在线内容中的毒性问题对心理和社会有负面影响，需要更好的检测方法。

Method: 整合现有数据集，标注毒性、目标群体和毒性片段，并评估大语言模型在毒性检测、目标群体识别和毒性片段提取上的表现。

Result: 微调模型表现优于零样本和少样本提示，但对某些社会群体效果不佳，且社会推理能力有限。

Conclusion: TRuST数据集有助于改进毒性检测，但大语言模型在社会推理方面仍需提升。

Abstract: Toxicity in online content, including content generated by language models,
has become a critical concern due to its potential for negative psychological
and social impact. This paper introduces TRuST, a comprehensive dataset
designed to improve toxicity detection that merges existing datasets, and has
labels for toxicity, target social group, and toxic spans. It includes a
diverse range of target groups such as ethnicity, gender, religion, disability,
and politics, with both human/machine-annotated and human machine-generated
data. We benchmark state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on toxicity
detection, target group identification, and toxic span extraction. We find that
fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot and few-shot prompting,
though performance remains low for certain social groups. Further, reasoning
capabilities do not significantly improve performance, indicating that LLMs
have weak social reasoning skills.

often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual
curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable.
We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight
summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language
reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and
Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances
selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures
both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of
purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean
Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9%

Motivation: 传统ICL方法在超出演示数据分布时表现不佳，X-ICL通过引入解释提升了可靠性，但仍需进一步优化。

Method: 提出X²-ICL框架，系统探索所有可能标签的解释，以增强决策的全面性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个自然语言理解数据集上验证，X²-ICL对分布外数据的鲁棒性显著优于现有ICL方法。

Conclusion: X²-ICL通过全面解释标签，显著提升了上下文学习的鲁棒性，为LLM的应用提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a successful paradigm for leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, it often struggles to generalize beyond
the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in
enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves
prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the
reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an
advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations
for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and
robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language
understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL, demonstrating
significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the
existing ICL approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的协同机制Consultant Decoding (CD)，通过改进验证机制显著提升了大型语言模型(LLM)的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Speculative Decoding (SD)机制因高拒绝率导致效率提升有限，需要改进验证机制以优化整体效率。

Method: 提出CD机制，利用LLM计算的token级似然性验证候选草案，而非SD的重要性采样指标。

Result: CD实现了推理速度最高2.5倍的提升，生成质量接近目标模型的100%，且大幅减少对大模型的调用频率。

Conclusion: CD不仅显著提升了效率，其性能甚至超越了理论上限，展示了协同机制的巨大潜力。

Abstract: The synergistic mechanism based on Speculative Decoding (SD) has garnered
considerable attention as a simple yet effective approach for accelerating the
inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the high rejection
rates require repeated LLMs calls to validate draft tokens, undermining the
overall efficiency gain of SD. In this work, we revisit existing verification
mechanisms and propose a novel synergetic mechanism Consultant Decoding (CD).
Unlike SD, which relies on a metric derived from importance sampling for
verification, CD verifies candidate drafts using token-level likelihoods
computed solely by the LLM. CD achieves up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference
speed compared to the target model, while maintaining comparable generation
quality (around 100% of the target model's performance). Interestingly, this is
achieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of
magnitude. In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model
to below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks. CD's performance was even
found to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents
the upper bound for speculative decoding.

Motivation: 当前GraphRAG模型的评估主要依赖传统问答数据集，其问题和评估指标范围有限，无法全面评估模型在复杂推理能力上的提升。

Method: 设计了GraphRAG-Bench基准测试，包含大学水平的领域特定问题、多样化任务类型（如多跳推理、数学推理等），并覆盖16个学科的20本核心教材。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench为研究社区提供了关于图架构、检索效果和推理能力的关键见解，并提出了可操作的指导。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing
recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by
structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex
reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely
on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions
and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity
improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce
GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\)
Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions
that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content
retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions
require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage.
The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice,
true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16
disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework.
GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG
pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer
generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence
of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to
GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based
structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals
critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning
capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

captioning, multilingual dialogic interaction, speech understanding, and
engaging speech generation to create an immersive learning environment in four
languages: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. We further improve the system
through multilingual pre-training, task-specific tuning, and scaffolding
optimization. Empirical studies with elementary school students demonstrate
that SingaKids provides effective dialogic teaching, benefiting learners at

Conclusion: 为模块化、通用性强的大语言模型关系提取系统设计提供指导。

Abstract: Entity relationship classification remains a challenging task in information
extraction, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data and complex
relational structures. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of
three distinct AI agent architectures designed to perform relation
classification using large language models (LLMs). The agentic architectures
explored include (1) reflective self-evaluation, (2) hierarchical task
decomposition, and (3) a novel multi-agent dynamic example generation
mechanism, each leveraging different modes of reasoning and prompt adaptation.
In particular, our dynamic example generation approach introduces real-time
cooperative and adversarial prompting. We systematically compare their
performance across multiple domains and model backends. Our experiments
demonstrate that multi-agent coordination consistently outperforms standard
few-shot prompting and approaches the performance of fine-tuned models. These
findings offer practical guidance for the design of modular, generalizable
LLM-based systems for structured relation extraction. The source codes and

Motivation: 当前对LLMs的评估方法未能全面反映其实际能力，尤其是忽略了未被观察到的知识，导致评估危机。

Result: 实验表明，KnowSum在估计总知识、评估信息检索效果和测量输出多样性方面有效，揭示了传统评估方法遗漏了大量知识。

Conclusion: KnowSum显著改变了常见LLMs的排名，强调了全面评估未被观察到知识的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
understanding their capabilities and guiding their development. However,
current evaluations often inconsistently reflect the actual capacities of these
models. In this paper, we demonstrate that one of many contributing factors to
this \textit{evaluation crisis} is the oversight of unseen knowledge --
information encoded by LLMs but not directly observed or not yet observed
during evaluations. We introduce KnowSum, a statistical framework designed to
provide a more comprehensive assessment by quantifying the unseen knowledge for
a class of evaluation tasks. KnowSum estimates the unobserved portion by
extrapolating from the appearance frequencies of observed knowledge instances.
We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of KnowSum across three critical
applications: estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval
effectiveness, and measuring output diversity. Our experiments reveal that a
substantial volume of knowledge is omitted when relying solely on observed LLM
performance. Importantly, KnowSum yields significantly different comparative
rankings for several common LLMs based on their internal knowledge.

Motivation: 现有深度研究框架主要生成纯文本内容，而自动化生成结合文本与可视化的多模态报告尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出FDV作为可视化结构化表示，并设计Multimodal DeepResearcher框架，分四阶段（研究、文本化、规划、多模态生成）完成任务。

Result: 实验表明，Multimodal DeepResearcher在相同模型下比基线方法总体胜率高出82%。

Conclusion: FDV和Multimodal DeepResearcher框架有效解决了多模态报告生成的挑战，为自动化研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and
information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation
have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate
comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks
primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated
generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel
task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and
effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we
propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual
representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse,
high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce
Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into
four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning,
and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated
multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100
diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive
experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness
of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet
model, Multimodal DeepResearcher achieves an 82\% overall win rate over the
baseline method.

Motivation: 探讨短形式测试与长形式输出中LLM价值偏好是否一致，以填补实际应用中价值相关风险的空白。

Method: 比较短形式反应和长形式响应中提取的价值偏好，分析不同参数设置下的相关性，并研究长形式生成属性与偏好的关系。

Result: 短形式与长形式偏好相关性弱；长形式生成设置间偏好一致性低；对齐方法对一致性提升有限。

Conclusion: 需开发更稳健的方法以确保LLM在不同应用中价值表达的一致性。

Abstract: Evaluations of LLMs' ethical risks and value inclinations often rely on
short-form surveys and psychometric tests, yet real-world use involves
long-form, open-ended responses -- leaving value-related risks and preferences
in practical settings largely underexplored. In this work, we ask: Do value
preferences inferred from short-form tests align with those expressed in
long-form outputs? To address this question, we compare value preferences
elicited from short-form reactions and long-form responses, varying the number
of arguments in the latter to capture users' differing verbosity preferences.
Analyzing five LLMs (llama3-8b, gemma2-9b, mistral-7b, qwen2-7b, and olmo-7b),
we find (1) a weak correlation between value preferences inferred from
short-form and long-form responses across varying argument counts, and (2)
similarly weak correlation between preferences derived from any two distinct
long-form generation settings. (3) Alignment yields only modest gains in the
consistency of value expression. Further, we examine how long-form generation
attributes relate to value preferences, finding that argument specificity
negatively correlates with preference strength, while representation across
scenarios shows a positive correlation. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust methods to ensure consistent value expression across diverse
applications.

Result: Minos在类似规模的开源评估模型中表现最佳，在T2I任务上超越所有开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 高质量人类评估数据和联合训练对多模态评估任务至关重要。

Abstract: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid
progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general
evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the
development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task,
and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper,
we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that
combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains
evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based
on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training
methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built
upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among
all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation
performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source
models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly
training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

Motivation: 当前金融领域的基准多基于新闻或报告，难以捕捉真实金融会议的动态，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 构建了一个多语言（英、中、日）、多行业（GICS分类）和多任务（摘要、QA对提取、问答）的数据集。

Conclusion: M³FinMeeting是一个全面且实用的基准，有助于提升LLM在金融会议理解中的能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have led to the
development of new benchmarks for evaluating their performance in the financial
domain. However, current financial benchmarks often rely on news articles,
earnings reports, or announcements, making it challenging to capture the
real-world dynamics of financial meetings. To address this gap, we propose a
novel benchmark called $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$, which is a multilingual,
multi-sector, and multi-task dataset designed for financial meeting
understanding. First, $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ supports English, Chinese, and
Japanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse
linguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by
the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark
spans a broad range of financial activities. Finally,
$\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer
(QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and
comprehensive evaluation of understanding. Experimental results with seven
popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced long-context models have
significant room for improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of
$\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ as a benchmark for assessing LLMs' financial meeting
comprehension skills.

Conclusion: FinChain为金融推理提供了新的评估工具，展示了当前模型的局限性，并支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is critical for advancing downstream
performance on financial tasks. Yet, benchmarks for systematically evaluating
this capability are lacking. Existing datasets like FinQA and ConvFinQA
supervise only final numerical answers, without assessing intermediate
reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce FinChain, the first symbolic
benchmark designed for verifiable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) financial reasoning.
Spanning 54 topics across 12 financial domains, Fin- Chain offers five
parameterized templates per topic, each varying in reasoning complexity and
domain expertise required. Each dataset instance includes an executable Python
trace, enabling automatic generation of extensive training data and easy
adaptation to other domains. We also introduce ChainEval, a new metric for
automatic evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning.
Benchmarking 30 LLMs on our dataset, we find that even state-of-the-art models
have considerable room for improvement in multi-step financial reasoning. All
templates and evaluation metrics for FinChain are available at https:

Motivation: 高质量知识库资源稀缺且语言有限，需要有效的嵌入模型实现跨语言知识共享，尤其是从高资源语言向低资源语言转移知识。

Method: 采用加权采样的对比学习策略微调多语言嵌入模型，支持单语言知识库的多语言信息检索。

Result: 加权采样策略在MRR和Recall@3指标上分别提升31.03%和33.98%。

Conclusion: 该方法语言无关，适用于多语言和代码混合场景。

Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval has emerged as powerful tools for
expanding knowledge sharing across languages. On the other hand, resources on
high quality knowledge base are often scarce and in limited languages,
therefore an effective embedding model to transform sentences from different
languages into a feature vector space same as the knowledge base language
becomes the key ingredient for cross language knowledge sharing, especially to
transfer knowledge available in high-resource languages to low-resource ones.
In this paper we propose a novel strategy to fine-tune multilingual embedding
models with weighted sampling for contrastive learning, enabling multilingual
information retrieval with a monolingual knowledge base. We demonstrate that
the weighted sampling strategy produces performance gains compared to standard
ones by up to 31.03\% in MRR and up to 33.98\% in Recall@3. Additionally, our
proposed methodology is language agnostic and applicable for both multilingual
and code switching use cases.

Motivation: 理解现代大型语言模型如何编码语言信息，尤其是词汇身份和屈折形态。

Method: 在BERT、GPT-2等经典模型及Pythia、Llama-3.1等现代模型上训练线性和非线性分类器，预测词干和屈折特征。

Result: 词汇信息在早期层线性集中，后期层非线性集中；屈折信息在各层均线性可分离。模型通过抽象化处理屈折形态，词汇身份依赖记忆。

Conclusion: 尽管模型架构和训练方式不同，但语言信息的组织方式相似，表明这些特性可能是预训练中学习到的核心特征。

Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our
understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of
early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models,
we investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and
contemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5,
Llama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology. We train
linear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word
lemmas and inflectional features. We discover that models concentrate lexical
information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later
layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and
linearly separable throughout the layers. Further analysis reveals that these
models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but
rely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity. Remarkably,
these patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in
architecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and
instruction-tuned variants). This consistency suggests that, despite
substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize
linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could
be fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during
pretraining. Our code is available at

Conclusion: CoRe-MMRAG有效解决了多模态知识不一致问题，显著提升了多模态检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to
enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved
multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved
Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and
retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and
Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between
visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{C}r\textbf{o}ss-source knowledge
\textbf{Re}conciliation for \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal \textbf{RAG}
(CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles
inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage
pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge,
then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity
assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to
produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm
enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified
answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG
achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6\% and
9.3\% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）需要大量计算资源，现有剪枝方法通常关注保留通用能力，但缺乏针对特定下游场景的轻量级专家模型。

Method: Cus-Prun方法通过识别和剪枝语言、领域和任务维度上无关的神经元，生成小型专家模型，无需后训练。

Result: 实验表明，Cus-Prun在多种模型和尺寸上均优于其他方法，专家和通用能力损失最小。

Conclusion: Cus-Prun是一种高效的方法，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下生成轻量级专家模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their substantial model sizes often require substantial computational
resources. To preserve computing resources and accelerate inference speed, it
is crucial to prune redundant parameters, especially for experienced users who
often need compact expert models tailored to specific downstream scenarios.
However, most existing pruning methods focus on preserving the model's general
capabilities, often requiring extensive post-training or suffering from
degraded performance due to coarse-grained pruning. In this work, we design a
$\underline{Cus}$tom $\underline{Prun}$ing method ($\texttt{Cus-Prun}$) to
prune a large general model into a smaller lightweight expert model, which is
positioned along the "language", "domain" and "task" dimensions. By identifying
and pruning irrelevant neurons of each dimension, $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ creates
expert models without any post-training. Our experiments demonstrate that
$\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ consistently outperforms other methods, achieving minimal
loss in both expert and general capabilities across various models from
different model families and sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索韵律（如语调、节奏和响度）在语音理解中独立于词汇内容的结构预测能力。

Method: 提出Masked Prosody Model，利用SSL分析韵律的声学相关结构，并通过探测实验验证其性能。

Result: 模型在长时结构（如情感识别）上表现优异，优于传统声学特征。

Conclusion: SSL训练目标的时间尺度对捕捉复杂韵律结构至关重要，且SSL编码结构优于传统方法。

Abstract: People exploit the predictability of lexical structures during text
comprehension. Though predictable structure is also present in speech, the
degree to which prosody, e.g. intonation, tempo, and loudness, contributes to
such structure independently of the lexical content is unclear. This study
leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of
structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our
proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local
information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels
involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments
across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed
pitch, energy, and voice activity features. Our results reveal the importance
of SSL training objective timescale and highlight the value of complex
SSL-encoded structures compared to more constrained classical structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多体裁的中文写作基准\benchName，用于评估大型语言模型在四种主要文体（议论文、记叙文、描写文、说明文）中的表现，并开发了细粒度的评分框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在中文写作评估中忽视了结构和修辞复杂性，尤其是在多体裁场景下，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 构建了包含728个真实世界提示的数据集，分为开放和约束两类，并开发了细粒度、体裁特定的评分框架。

Result: 通过人类一致性研究验证了评估协议，并测试了15个大型语言模型在不同体裁和指令类型中的表现。

Conclusion: \benchName旨在推动基于LLM的中文写作评估，并为教育场景中的写作生成研究提供启发。

Abstract: Chinese essay writing and its evaluation are critical in educational
contexts, yet the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain
remain largely underexplored. Existing benchmarks often rely on coarse-grained
text quality metrics, largely overlooking the structural and rhetorical
complexities of Chinese essays, particularly across diverse genres. To address
this gap, we propose \benchName, a multi-genre benchmark specifically designed
for Chinese essay writing across four major genres: Argumentative, Narrative,
Descriptive, and Expository. We curate and refine a total of 728 real-world
prompts to ensure authenticity and meticulously categorize them into the
\textit{Open-Ended} and \textit{Constrained} sets to capture diverse writing
scenarios. To reliably evaluate generated essays, we develop a fine-grained,
genre-specific scoring framework that hierarchically aggregates scores. We
further validate our evaluation protocol through a comprehensive human
agreement study. Finally, we benchmark 15 large-sized LLMs, analyzing their
strengths and limitations across genres and instruction types. With \benchName,
we aim to advance LLM-based Chinese essay evaluation and inspire future
research on improving essay generation in educational settings.

*Sifan Li,Yujun Cai,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HC-Bench评测显示，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测隐藏内容（如光学错觉或AI生成图像中的隐藏文本和物体）时表现极差（0-5.36%准确率）。通过SemVink方法（将图像缩放至低分辨率），准确率提升至>99%，揭示了VLMs过度依赖高层语义而忽视低层视觉操作的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLMs在检测隐藏内容方面的不足，强调其在低层视觉操作上的缺陷，并探索改进方法以提升模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出HC-Bench评测集（112张包含隐藏内容的图像），并通过SemVink方法（将图像缩放至低分辨率）消除冗余视觉噪声。

Result: VLMs在HC-Bench上表现极差（0-5.36%准确率），而SemVink方法显著提升准确率至>99%。

Conclusion: VLMs需结合多尺度处理以弥补低层视觉操作的不足，推动更接近人类认知的混合模型发展，适用于医学影像、安全等领域。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core
human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated
images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a
benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing
that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit
prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to
an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink
(Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128
pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise.
This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning
over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work
urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging
the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in
medical imaging, security, and beyond.

Motivation: 现有基准多并行评估模型，而EvaLearn关注模型在连续任务中的学习能力，填补了评估空白。

Method: EvaLearn包含182个任务序列，提供五种自动化指标评估模型学习能力，测试了九种前沿模型。

Result: 不同模型表现各异，部分模型如Claude-3.7-sonnet学习能力强，而部分模型无法从经验中受益。

Conclusion: EvaLearn为评估LLM潜力提供了新视角，揭示了静态能力与学习能力的不一致性，推动了更动态的评估方法发展。

Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in
challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential.
EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into
182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most
existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models
to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained
from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics
to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We
extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance
profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial
performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to
benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we
investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that
instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model
learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static
abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all
tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model
performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for
assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human
capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation
approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results
studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

TL;DR: GUI-Actor提出了一种基于VLM的坐标无关GUI定位方法，通过注意力机制和验证器提升性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GUI代理在视觉定位中的空间语义对齐弱、模糊监督目标处理能力差以及坐标与视觉特征粒度不匹配的问题。

Method: 引入注意力动作头和对齐<ACTOR>标记，设计验证器选择最佳动作区域，微调少量参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，GUI-Actor-7B超越UI-TARS-72B，验证器进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: GUI-Actor无需牺牲VLM通用性即可增强其定位能力，参数效率高。

Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual
grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution
based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work
formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these
approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment,
inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the
dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of
visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we
propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its
core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align
a dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the
model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line
with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the
most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.
Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved
generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B
even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7
with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by
incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced
action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone
frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying
VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its
general-purpose strengths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE-Align框架通过结合检索增强和思维链优化，显著提升大语言模型在垂直领域的准确性、推理能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在垂直领域中准确性、推理能力和可解释性不足的问题，传统方法如RLHF和DPO忽略了知识来源和推理逻辑。

Method: 提出RACE-Align框架，构建包含外部知识和显式思维链的偏好数据集，并使用DPO算法对齐模型。

Result: 在传统中医领域实验中，RACE-Align显著优于基础模型和仅用SFT微调的模型，提升了答案准确性、信息丰富度、推理逻辑和可解释性。

Conclusion: RACE-Align为增强大语言模型在复杂垂直领域的知识应用、推理可靠性和过程透明度提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy, domain-specific
reasoning, and interpretability in vertical domains. Traditional preference
alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge
sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align
(Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel
framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically
constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support
and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO
algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction
strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing
knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of
domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference
dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively
generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that
RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model
fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed
across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness,
application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and
interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway
to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process
transparency in complex vertical domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和英语词汇档案（EVP）的新方法，用于细粒度评估二语学习者的词汇使用，解决了多义性、上下文变化和多词表达等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词汇评估方法通常关注词性相关的独立使用，而忽略了词汇在句子中的精确使用。本文旨在通过结合LLMs和EVP，实现更精细的词汇评估。

Method: 结合LLMs和EVP，评估LLMs为二语学习者写作中的词汇分配熟练度等级的能力，并与基于词性的基线方法进行比较。

Result: LLMs能够利用额外的语义信息，表现出更好的性能。同时，还探讨了词汇熟练度与文章熟练度之间的相关性，并验证了EVP熟练度等级的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs非常适合词汇评估任务，能够有效提升评估的精确性和实用性。

Abstract: Vocabulary use is a fundamental aspect of second language (L2) proficiency.
To date, its assessment by automated systems has typically examined the
context-independent, or part-of-speech (PoS) related use of words. This paper
introduces a novel approach to enable fine-grained vocabulary evaluation
exploiting the precise use of words within a sentence. The scheme combines
large language models (LLMs) with the English Vocabulary Profile (EVP). The EVP
is a standard lexical resource that enables in-context vocabulary use to be
linked with proficiency level. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to assign
proficiency levels to individual words as they appear in L2 learner writing,
addressing key challenges such as polysemy, contextual variation, and
multi-word expressions. We compare LLMs to a PoS-based baseline. LLMs appear to
exploit additional semantic information that yields improved performance. We
also explore correlations between word-level proficiency and essay-level
proficiency. Finally, the approach is applied to examine the consistency of the
EVP proficiency levels. Results show that LLMs are well-suited for the task of
vocabulary assessment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用正交变换优化预训练大语言模型权重矩阵压缩的方法，以减少计算和内存资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但需要大量计算和内存资源。结构化矩阵表示是减少参数数量的潜在方法，但直接应用于预训练模型可能不准确。

Method: 利用LLM输出在特定正交变换下不变的性质，找到能显著提升权重矩阵在结构化类别中可压缩性的变换。

Result: 该方法适用于多种支持高效投影操作的结构化矩阵。

Conclusion: 通过正交变换优化权重矩阵的压缩性，为减少LLMs资源需求提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive results in natural
language processing tasks but require a significant amount of computational and
memory resources. Structured matrix representations are a promising way for
reducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems
unrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be
accurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning. To
overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under
certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be
leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the
compressibility of weights within structured classes. The proposed approach is
applicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient
projection operations. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文反驳了Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示能引发大语言模型真实抽象推理能力的观点，认为CoT仅是一种结构约束，引导模型模仿推理形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对CoT提示被广泛认为能激发大语言模型推理能力的现象，提出理论反驳，探讨其实际作用机制。

Method: 通过理论分析，论证CoT提示通过强制生成中间步骤，利用模型的序列预测和模式匹配能力，而非真实推理。

Result: CoT提示通过结构约束使模型输出类似连贯思维过程的序列，但并未实现真实推理。

Conclusion: CoT提示的作用是形式模仿而非真实推理，需重新评估其在大语言模型中的实际能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrably enhanced the performance of
Large Language Models on tasks requiring multi-step inference. This success has
led to widespread claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in these models. In
this paper, we present a theoretical counter-perspective: Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) does not elicit genuine, abstract reasoning. Instead, we argue that
Chain-of-Thought functions as a powerful structural constraint that guides
Large Language Models to imitate the form of reasoning. By forcing the
generation of intermediate steps, Chain-of-Thought leverages the model immense
capacity for sequence prediction and pattern matching, effectively constraining
its output to sequences that resemble coherent thought processes.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在单细胞RNA测序数据标注中缺乏批量级上下文推理和解释性，而人类专家则能基于领域知识为不同细胞簇标注独特类型。

Method: 提出CellPuzzles任务，训练7B参数的Cell-o1模型，通过监督微调和批量级奖励的强化学习优化推理能力。

Result: Cell-o1在批量级准确率上比最佳基线模型（OpenAI o1）提升73%，并在多种情境中表现优异。

Conclusion: Cell-o1通过模仿专家推理行为，实现了批量级细胞类型标注的突破，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of
single-cell RNA sequencing data. Although recent foundation models automate
this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering
batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast,
human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters
based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the
CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch
of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions,
and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label
uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on
CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0%
batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained
via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by
reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing
well across contexts. Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning
behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and
emergent expert-like reasoning. Code and data are available at

Abstract: In this work, we describe our team's approach to eRisk's 2025 Task 1: Search
for Symptoms of Depression. Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression
Inventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up
to 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance.
Participant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information
Retrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision
(R-PREC). The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled
as to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's
symptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a
binary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To
that end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation
sets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large
Language Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results
revealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance,
particularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We
also observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these
insights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble
methods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation,
outperforming submissions from 16 other teams.

Conclusion: 该框架在计算和统计效率上优于监督微调，适用于人类反馈有限的情况。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge is a framework in which a large language model (LLM)
automatically evaluates the output of another LLM. We propose quantitative LLM
judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in
a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the
score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score.
We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and
relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our
framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised
fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is
limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these
claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show
that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of
existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs) poses potential risks, motivating
the development of machine-generated text (MGT) detection. Existing literature
primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting
texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this
paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI
coauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward
coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a
dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic
pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing
document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we
evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection
tasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct
fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models
show superior performance and better generalization across domains. However, we
argue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved. We
further analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and
highlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for
improvement.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在回答初级保健考试题目中表现出色，尤其是o3模型表现最佳，支持其在初级保健中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试领先的LLMs（o3、Claude Opus 4、Grok3和Gemini 2.5 Pro）在初级保健教育中回答MRCGP风格考试问题的能力。

Method: 让这些模型回答100道随机选择的MRCGP考试题目，包括文本、实验室结果和临床图像，评分标准为正确答案。

Result: o3得分99.0%，其他模型均为95.0%，均显著高于平均得分73.0%。

Conclusion: LLMs（尤其是推理模型）在初级保健中具有巨大潜力，尤其是经过专门训练的模型。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial
potential to support clinical practice. Other than Chat GPT4 and its
predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful
reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination
questions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test
the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and
Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of
the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.
  Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer
100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General
Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual
information, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted
to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.
Each question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against
correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.
  Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was
99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the
same questions was 73.0%.
  Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially
exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the
same questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of
the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not
substantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for
LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care,
especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical
data.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何在不同法律抽象层级上调整大型语言模型（LLMs）以识别仇恨言论，发现模型在法律评估中仍与专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能够内化法律系统，特别是在识别仇恨言论方面的能力。

Method: 提出并测试了在不同法律抽象层级上调整LLMs的方法，专注于德国刑法中煽动仇恨罪的社交媒体帖子分类。

Result: 模型在法律评估中表现不佳，抽象法律知识导致模型自相矛盾，具体法律知识模型在识别目标群体上表现较好，但在行为分类上仍有困难。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律系统中的应用仍需改进，尤其是在任务理解和行为分类方面。

Abstract: The assessment of legal problems requires the consideration of a specific
legal system and its levels of abstraction, from constitutional law to
statutory law to case law. The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs)
internalize such legal systems is unknown. In this paper, we propose and
investigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of
abstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to
conditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect
potentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether
a specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to
hatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there
is still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the
legal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with
which the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models
conditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often
contradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete
legal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target
groups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的SLU技术依赖大量训练数据，但特定任务或语言的标注数据有限，而指令调优的大语言模型（LLMs）在少样本设置下表现优异，因此探索如何优化提示以提高SLU性能。

Method: 通过信息检索（IR）方法选择示例，构建增强提示，应用于SLU任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，词汇IR方法在不增加提示长度的情况下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 利用IR方法优化提示是一种有效的少样本SLU任务解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding user queries is fundamental in many applications, such as home
assistants, booking systems, or recommendations. Accordingly, it is crucial to
develop accurate Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) approaches to ensure the
reliability of the considered system. Current State-of-the-Art SLU techniques
rely on large amounts of training data; however, only limited annotated
examples are available for specific tasks or languages.
  In the meantime, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown
exceptional performance on unseen tasks in a few-shot setting when provided
with adequate prompts. In this work, we propose to explore example selection by
leveraging Information retrieval (IR) approaches to build an enhanced prompt
that is applied to an SLU task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
method on several SLU benchmarks. Experimental results show that lexical IR
methods significantly enhance performance without increasing prompt length.

Abstract: Factuality is a necessary precursor to useful educational tools. As adoption
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education continues of grow, ensuring
correctness in all settings is paramount. Despite their strong English
capabilities, LLM performance in other languages is largely untested. In this
work, we evaluate the correctness of the Llama3.1 family of models in answering
factual questions appropriate for middle and high school students. We
demonstrate that LLMs not only provide extraneous and less truthful

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型中的分词偏差（tokenisation bias），即分词器选择如何影响模型对字符序列的概率分配。通过因果效应估计方法，发现分词对模型输出有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常基于子词序列训练，但最终定义的是字符序列的概率。理想情况下，分词器的选择不应影响字符序列的概率分配，但实际上存在偏差。本文旨在量化这种分词偏差。

Method: 将分词偏差定义为因果效应，并利用回归间断设计（regression discontinuity design）进行估计。通过比较分词器词汇表中排名相近的子词，量化其影响。

Result: 实验表明，分词对模型输出有显著影响，尤其是在小模型中，子词的存在可能使字符概率增加高达17倍。

Conclusion: 分词是语言模型设计中的关键因素，其选择显著影响模型行为。

Abstract: Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but
ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of
the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect
the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it
does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify
one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a
subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the
probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,
\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model
is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation
bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity
design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank
subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an
arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing
similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation
consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and
tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may
increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting
tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.

TL;DR: 论文提出Critique-GRPO框架，结合自然语言和数值反馈优化RL，显著提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法仅依赖数值反馈存在性能瓶颈、自我反思效果有限和持续失败问题。

Method: 提出Critique-GRPO框架，整合自然语言和数值反馈，支持模型从初始响应和反馈中同时学习。

Result: 实验显示Critique-GRPO在多项任务中优于监督学习和RL方法，平均提升4.5%-5%的pass@1分数。

Conclusion: Critique-GRPO通过自然语言反馈有效解决RL瓶颈，同时揭示了策略探索中的关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such
as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify
three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:
performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent
failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting
performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed
problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.
Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that
integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy
optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and
critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.
Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that
Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based
fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general
reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,
respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that
incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals
two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not
always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses
do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.

Abstract: Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge.
Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from
this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when
knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art
retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A
knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources,
but existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled
data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a
specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work
proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale
neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM),
neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance
of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge
graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to
extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate
the proposed approaches, and the results demonstrate that our methods
significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience
research corpus. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction, and the
knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 54% of the questions.

Motivation: 区块链交易数据的高维、噪声和纠缠特性使传统聚类算法难以处理，且量子增强聚类模型的解释性有限，限制了其在敏感领域的应用。

Method: 第一阶段使用经典聚类方法和评估指标确定最佳聚类数量和基线质量；第二阶段引入AI代理生成可解释的聚类结果语义描述。

Result: 实验表明，量子神经网络（QNN）在定量指标上优于随机量子特征（QF），而AI代理揭示了QNN模型的单例聚类现象。三聚类配置被一致推荐。

Conclusion: 该工作提升了量子辅助区块链分析的解释性，为未来自主AI驱动的聚类框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data is inherently high dimensional, noisy, and
entangled, posing substantial challenges for traditional clustering algorithms.
While quantum enhanced clustering models have demonstrated promising
performance gains, their interpretability remains limited, restricting their
application in sensitive domains such as financial fraud detection and
blockchain governance. To address this gap, we propose a two stage analysis
framework that synergistically combines quantitative clustering evaluation with
AI Agent assisted qualitative interpretation. In the first stage, we employ
classical clustering methods and evaluation metrics including the Silhouette
Score, Davies Bouldin Index, and Calinski Harabasz Index to determine the
optimal cluster count and baseline partition quality. In the second stage, we
integrate an AI Agent to generate human readable, semantic explanations of
clustering results, identifying intra cluster characteristics and inter cluster
relationships. Our experiments reveal that while fully trained Quantum Neural
Networks (QNN) outperform random Quantum Features (QF) in quantitative metrics,
the AI Agent further uncovers nuanced differences between these methods,
notably exposing the singleton cluster phenomenon in QNN driven models. The
consolidated insights from both stages consistently endorse the three cluster
configuration, demonstrating the practical value of our hybrid approach. This
work advances the interpretability frontier in quantum assisted blockchain
analytics and lays the groundwork for future autonomous AI orchestrated
clustering frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在单台多GPU服务器上部署DeepSeek-R1 671B模型时MLA推理效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出Efficient Transpose Attention Pipeline（ETAP），通过转置注意力计算减少冗余计算。

Result: 在64K序列长度下，FlashMLA-ETAP比FlashMLA快2.78倍，比FlashAttention-3和FlashInfer分别快5.24倍和4.94倍，且数值稳定性更高。

Conclusion: ETAP为资源受限的推理提供了可扩展解决方案，推动了硬件感知优化的广泛应用。

Abstract: Efficient inference of Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is challenged by
deploying the DeepSeek-R1 671B model on a single Multi-GPU server. This paper
introduces FlashMLA-ETAP, a novel framework that enhances MLA inference for the
single-instance deployment scenario on NVIDIA H20 GPUs. We propose the
Efficient Transpose Attention Pipeline (ETAP), which reconfigures attention
computation through transposition to align the KV context length with the
\(M\)-dimension in WGMMA operations, significantly reducing redundant
computations. FlashMLA-ETAP achieves a 2.78x speedup over FlashMLA at 64K
sequence length (batch size 16), with 5.24x and 4.94x improvements over
FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, respectively, while maintaining numerical
stability with a 15.2x lower RMSE (\(1.25 \times 10^{-5}\)) than
FlashAttention-3. Furthermore, ETAP's design enables seamless integration into
frameworks like FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, supported by a detailed
theoretical analysis. Our work addresses a critical gap in resource-constrained
inference, offering a scalable solution for mid-tier GPUs and paving the way
for broader adoption in hardware-aware optimization. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法因串行执行导致模型间相互等待，限制了效率提升。

Method: 引入分支并行化技术，结合自适应草稿长度和混合特征重用策略。

Result: 实验显示，SpecBranch比自回归解码快1.8~4.5倍，并减少50%的回滚标记。

Conclusion: SpecBranch通过分支并行化显著提升了LLM推理效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Recently, speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique to
accelerate LLM inference by employing a small draft model to propose draft
tokens in advance, and validating them in parallel with the large target model.
However, the existing SD methods still remain fundamentally constrained by
their serialized execution, which causes the mutual waiting bubbles between the
draft and target models. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from
branch prediction in modern processors and propose a novel framework
\textbf{SpecBranch} to unlock branch parallelism in SD. Specifically, we first
take an in-depth analysis of the potential of branch parallelism in SD, and
recognize that the key challenge lies in the trade-offs between parallelization
and token rollback. Based on the analysis, we strategically introduce parallel
speculative branches to preemptively hedge against likely rejections.
Meanwhile, to enhance parallelism, we jointly orchestrate adaptive draft
lengths with a hybrid combination of the implicit draft model confidence and
explicit reusing of target model features. Extensive experiments across various
models and benchmarks show that SpecBranch achieves over \textbf{1.8}$\times
\sim$ \textbf{4.5}$\times$ speedups against the auto-regressive decoding and
reduces rollback tokens by $\textbf{50}$\% for poorly aligned models, realizing
its applicability for real-world deployments.

Result: 在多节点分布式训练场景中，eACGM成功捕获性能异常，且开销低、稳定性高。

Conclusion: eACGM适用于大规模AI/ML系统，为性能优化和故障诊断提供支持。

Abstract: We present eACGM, a full-stack AI/ML system monitoring framework based on
eBPF. eACGM collects real-time performance data from key hardware components,
including the GPU and network communication layer, as well as from key software
stacks such as CUDA, Python, and PyTorch, all without requiring any code
instrumentation or modifications. Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather
process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for
statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies
complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and
communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks
and abnormal behaviors.
  To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive
empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training
scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a
non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical
performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly
detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its
applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing
strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale
AI/ML systems.

Motivation: 传统HPC调度方法（如FCFS或启发式算法）难以适应动态负载和异构系统，因此需要一种更灵活、透明的解决方案。

Method: 采用LLM和ReAct框架，结合便签内存记录调度历史，并通过自然语言反馈优化决策，同时使用约束模块确保可行性。

Result: 在多种真实HPC场景中，LLM调度器优于FCFS、SJF和OR-Tools，能平衡多目标并提供透明推理，但计算开销较大。

Conclusion: LLM在HPC调度中具有潜力，但需解决计算效率问题，为动态环境下的复杂调度提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) job scheduling involves balancing
conflicting objectives such as minimizing makespan, reducing wait times,
optimizing resource use, and ensuring fairness. Traditional methods, including
heuristic-based (e.g., First-Come-First-Served) or intensive optimization
techniques, often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and heterogeneous HPC
systems. To address this, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based
scheduler using a ReAct-style framework (Reason + Act), enabling iterative,
interpretable decision-making. The system incorporates a scratchpad memory to
track scheduling history and refine decisions via natural language feedback,
while a constraint enforcement module ensures feasibility and safety. We
evaluate our approach using OpenAI's O4-Mini and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 across
seven real-world HPC workload scenarios, including heterogeneous mixes, bursty
patterns, and adversarial cases. Comparisons against FCFS, Shortest Job First,
and Google OR-Tools (on 10 to 100 jobs) reveal that LLM-based scheduling
effectively balances multiple objectives while offering transparent reasoning
through natural language traces. The method excels in constraint satisfaction
and adapts to diverse workloads without domain-specific training. However, a
trade-off between reasoning quality and computational overhead challenges
real-time deployment. This work presents the first comprehensive study of
reasoning-capable LLMs for HPC scheduling, demonstrating their potential to
handle multiobjective optimization while highlighting limitations in
computational efficiency. The findings provide insights into leveraging
advanced language models for complex scheduling problems in dynamic HPC
environments.

Conclusion: EvoGit展示了去中心化、自动化软件开发的潜力，为未来协作开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce EvoGit, a decentralized multi-agent framework for collaborative
software development driven by autonomous code evolution. EvoGit deploys a
population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared
codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared
memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic
graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously
read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure
supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent
interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement
is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review
the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or
prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to
autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two
real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern

### [387] [Machine Learning for Consistency Violation Faults Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02002)
*Kamal Giri,Amit Garu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的方法，用于分析一致性违规故障（CVFs）对分布式系统的影响，并以Dijkstra的Token Ring问题为例进行研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式系统中常见的一致性违规故障（CVFs）会导致节点操作过时或不准确的数据，影响系统收敛和性能，因此需要量化其影响。

Method: 通过计算程序转换等级及其影响，提出了一种量化CVFs影响的方法。针对大规模图的状态空间爆炸问题，采用了前馈神经网络（FNN）和分布式神经网络（基于TensorFlow的tf.distribute API）两种模型。

Result: 实验结果显示模型表现良好，测试损失为4.39，平均绝对误差为1.5。分布式训练在CPU上未显著提升速度，但表明通过GPU或TPU等硬件加速器可提高可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化CVFs的影响，未来可通过硬件加速进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Distributed systems frequently encounter consistency violation faults (cvfs),
where nodes operate on outdated or inaccurate data, adversely affecting
convergence and overall system performance. This study presents a machine
learning-based approach for analyzing the impact of CVFs, using Dijkstra's
Token Ring problem as a case study. By computing program transition ranks and
their corresponding effects, the proposed method quantifies the influence of
cvfs on system behavior. To address the state space explosion encountered in
larger graphs, two models are implemented: a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
and a distributed neural network leveraging TensorFlow's \texttt{tf.distribute}
API. These models are trained on datasets generated from smaller graphs (3 to
10 nodes) to predict parameters essential for determining rank effects.
Experimental results demonstrate promising performance, with a test loss of
4.39 and a mean absolute error of 1.5. Although distributed training on a CPU
did not yield significant speed improvements over a single-device setup, the
findings suggest that scalability could be enhanced through the use of advanced
hardware accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MorphServe是一个动态、工作负载感知的LLM服务框架，通过量化层交换和KV缓存调整，显著减少SLO违规并提升延迟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有服务框架和静态模型压缩技术无法适应动态工作负载波动，导致SLO违规或精度下降。

Method: MorphServe采用量化层交换和压力感知KV缓存调整两种异步运行时机制。

Result: 实验显示，MorphServe将平均SLO违规减少92.45%，P95 TTFT延迟提升2.2x-3.9x，且不牺牲生成质量。

Conclusion: MorphServe是动态环境中LLM部署的实用弹性解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) under dynamic and bursty
workloads remains a key challenge for real-world deployment. Existing serving
frameworks and static model compression techniques fail to adapt to workload
fluctuations, leading to either service-level objective (SLO) violations under
full-precision serving or persistent accuracy degradation with static
quantization. We present MorphServe, a dynamic, workload-aware LLM serving
framework based on morphological adaptation. MorphServe introduces two
asynchronous, token-level runtime mechanisms: quantized layer swapping, which
selectively replaces less impactful layers with quantized alternatives during
high-load periods, and pressure-aware KV cache resizing, which dynamically
adjusts KV cache capacity in response to memory pressure. These mechanisms
enable state-preserving transitions with minimum runtime overhead and are fully
compatible with modern scheduling and attention techniques. Extensive
experiments on Vicuna and Llama family models with real-world workloads
demonstrate that MorphServe reduces average SLO violations by 92.45 percent and
improves the P95 TTFT latency by 2.2x-3.9x compared to full-precision serving,
without compromising generation quality. These results establish MorphServe as
a practical and elastic solution for LLM deployment in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: DistMLIP是一个基于零冗余和图级并行化的高效分布式推理平台，用于机器学习原子间势（MLIPs），能够实现大规模原子模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模原子模拟是连接计算材料与化学到实际材料和药物发现应用的关键。机器学习原子间势（MLIPs）的发展为解决量子力学计算的扩展提供了可能，但多设备并行化仍具挑战性。

Method: DistMLIP通过图分区而非传统的空间分区实现高效并行化，支持灵活的多层图神经网络架构，并提供易用的插件接口。

Result: 在8个GPU上，DistMLIP实现了近百万原子规模的计算，仅需几秒钟。

Conclusion: DistMLIP为现有MLIPs提供了高效、灵活的分布式推理解决方案，显著扩展了模拟规模。

Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational
materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications.
In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic
potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical
calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple
devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending
simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present
DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on
zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional
space-partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP
parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on
flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks.
DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables
distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four
widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We
show that existing foundational potentials can perform near-million-atom
calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes集群状态一致性维护困难，故障导致经济损失，需可靠根因分析工具提升可靠性。

Method: 结合LLMs、图数据库检索和专家提示，构建StateGraph和MetaGraph，提供上下文相关分析。

Result: 在真实Kubernetes集群数据测试中，SynergyRCA高效识别多种根因，平均时间两分钟，精度约0.90。

Conclusion: SynergyRCA展示了利用LLMs和图数据库在Kubernetes根因分析中的潜力，显著提升效率和精度。

Abstract: Kubernetes, a notably complex and distributed system, utilizes an array of
controllers to uphold cluster management logic through state reconciliation.
Nevertheless, maintaining state consistency presents significant challenges due
to unexpected failures, network disruptions, and asynchronous issues,
especially within dynamic cloud environments. These challenges result in
operational disruptions and economic losses, underscoring the necessity for
robust root cause analysis (RCA) to enhance Kubernetes reliability. The
development of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising direction for
RCA. However, existing methodologies encounter several obstacles, including the
diverse and evolving nature of Kubernetes incidents, the intricate context of
incidents, and the polymorphic nature of these incidents. In this paper, we
introduce SynergyRCA, an innovative tool that leverages LLMs with retrieval
augmentation from graph databases and enhancement with expert prompts.
SynergyRCA constructs a StateGraph to capture spatial and temporal
relationships and utilizes a MetaGraph to outline entity connections. Upon the
occurrence of an incident, an LLM predicts the most pertinent resource, and
SynergyRCA queries the MetaGraph and StateGraph to deliver context-specific
insights for RCA. We evaluate SynergyRCA using datasets from two production
Kubernetes clusters, highlighting its capacity to identify numerous root
causes, including novel ones, with high efficiency and precision. SynergyRCA
demonstrates the ability to identify root causes in an average time of about
two minutes and achieves an impressive precision of approximately 0.90.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM服务中KV缓存的优化对提升吞吐量和延迟至关重要，但现有研究缺乏对实际工作负载模式的系统分析。

Method: 通过分析领先LLM服务提供商的KV缓存工作负载，提取关键观察结果，并提出基于工作负载的缓存淘汰策略。

Result: 发现KV缓存重用具有多样性和可预测性，且理想缓存命中率所需缓存大小适中；提出的策略在真实场景下显著提升性能。

Conclusion: KV缓存的工作负载模式具有规律性，基于工作负载的缓存淘汰策略能有效优化LLM服务性能。

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and
caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially
improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited
understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system
design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In
this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$
workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw
observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic
workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses
between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the
reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a
specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall
cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the
characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy
that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with
limited cache capacity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无线个性化联邦学习中的隐私问题和性能公平性挑战。

Method: 利用量化误差增强隐私，提出量化辅助高斯差分隐私机制，并通过优化传输调度策略实现公平性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性、最大测试损失和公平性上分别优于其他策略87.08%、16.21%和38.37%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了WPFL的隐私保护和性能公平性。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) offers a solution to balancing
personalization and generalization by conducting federated learning (FL) to
guide personalized learning (PL). Little attention has been given to wireless
PFL (WPFL), where privacy concerns arise. Performance fairness of PL models is
another challenge resulting from communication bottlenecks in WPFL. This paper
exploits quantization errors to enhance the privacy of WPFL and proposes a
novel quantization-assisted Gaussian differential privacy (DP) mechanism. We
analyze the convergence upper bounds of individual PL models by considering the
impact of the mechanism (i.e., quantization errors and Gaussian DP noises) and
imperfect communication channels on the FL of WPFL. By minimizing the maximum
of the bounds, we design an optimal transmission scheduling strategy that
yields min-max fairness for WPFL with OFDMA interfaces. This is achieved by
revealing the nested structure of this problem to decouple it into subproblems
solved sequentially for the client selection, channel allocation, and power
control, and for the learning rates and PL-FL weighting coefficients.
Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that our approach
substantially outperforms alternative scheduling strategies by 87.08%, 16.21%,
and 38.37% in accuracy, the maximum test loss of participating clients, and
fairness (Jain's index), respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了异构节点和动态网络环境中的训练性能，适用于云计算等复杂场景。

Abstract: Hybrid parallelism techniques are essential for efficiently training large
language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, current automatic parallel planning
frameworks often overlook the simultaneous consideration of node heterogeneity
and dynamic network topology changes, limiting their effectiveness in practical
applications. In this paper, we address these limitations by modeling
heterogeneous nodes within dynamically changing network environments and
leveraging simulation-based strategies to determine optimal parallel
configurations. Our approach enables fine-grained workload allocation tailored
for heterogeneous nodes and complex network scenarios, achieving performance
competitive with state-of-the-art methods under regular and stable network
conditions. Additionally, we introduce a strategy pruning technique to rapidly
discard infeasible parallel configurations, substantially reducing the search
space and accelerating the search process through parallel execution within the
simulator. Preliminary evaluations confirm that our method notably enhances
training performance on heterogeneous nodes and demonstrates improved
adaptability in complex, dynamic scenarios such as cloud computing
environments.

Conclusion: 整合细粒度语义属性和多模态学习技术有助于推进城市基础模型发展。

Abstract: Spatial representations that capture both structural and semantic
characteristics of urban environments are essential for urban modeling.
Traditional spatial embeddings often prioritize spatial proximity while
underutilizing fine-grained contextual information from places. To address this
limitation, we introduce CaLLiPer+, an extension of the CaLLiPer model that
systematically integrates Point-of-Interest (POI) names alongside categorical
labels within a multimodal contrastive learning framework. We evaluate its
effectiveness on two downstream tasks, land use classification and
socioeconomic status distribution mapping, demonstrating consistent performance
gains of 4% to 11% over baseline methods. Additionally, we show that
incorporating POI names enhances location retrieval, enabling models to capture
complex urban concepts with greater precision. Ablation studies further reveal
the complementary role of POI names and the advantages of leveraging pretrained
text encoders for spatial representations. Overall, our findings highlight the
potential of integrating fine-grained semantic attributes and multimodal
learning techniques to advance the development of urban foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lakehouse系统中，手动选择最适合的引擎执行SQL查询复杂且困难，尤其是随着新引擎和工作负载的出现。

Method: 使用多任务学习的成本模型，通过查询计划和提示进行成本预测和路由，支持灵活添加新引擎。

Result: 优化后的逻辑计划将平均Q误差降低了12.6%，跨引擎优化器在零样本和少样本设置下分别减少了25.2%和30.4%的工作负载运行时间。

Conclusion: 跨引擎优化器有效解决了引擎选择问题，显著提升了查询性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Lakehouse systems enable the same data to be queried with multiple execution
engines. However, selecting the engine best suited to run a SQL query still
requires a priori knowledge of the query computational requirements and an
engine capability, a complex and manual task that only becomes more difficult
with the emergence of new engines and workloads. In this paper, we address this
limitation by proposing a cross-engine optimizer that can automate engine
selection for diverse SQL queries through a learned cost model. Optimized with
hints, a query plan is used for query cost prediction and routing. Cost
prediction is formulated as a multi-task learning problem, and multiple
predictor heads, corresponding to different engines and provisionings, are used
in the model architecture. This eliminates the need to train engine-specific
models and allows the flexible addition of new engines at a minimal fine-tuning
cost. Results on various databases and engines show that using a query
optimized logical plan for cost estimation decreases the average Q-error by
even 12.6% over using unoptimized plans as input. Moreover, the proposed
cross-engine optimizer reduces the total workload runtime by up to 25.2% in a
zero-shot setting and 30.4% in a few-shot setting when compared to random
routing.

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如C-index）仅关注模型的区分能力，而忽略了时间预测准确性和概率校准等重要方面，导致模型评估不全面。

Result: 发现当前评估方法存在局限性，提出新的评估框架，强调模型和评估指标需基于相同假设。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁采用更全面的评估方法，并讨论了反对观点，为生存分析模型的实践评估提供了指导。

Abstract: We argue that many survival analysis and time-to-event models are incorrectly
evaluated. First, we survey many examples of evaluation approaches in the
literature and find that most rely on concordance (C-index). However, the
C-index only measures a model's discriminative ability and does not assess
other important aspects, such as the accuracy of the time-to-event predictions
or the calibration of the model's probabilistic estimates. Next, we present a
set of key desiderata for choosing the right evaluation metric and discuss
their pros and cons. These are tailored to the challenges in survival analysis,
such as sensitivity to miscalibration and various censoring assumptions. We
hypothesize that the current development of survival metrics conforms to a
double-helix ladder, and that model validity and metric validity must stand on
the same rung of the assumption ladder. Finally, we discuss the appropriate
methods for evaluating a survival model in practice and summarize various
viewpoints opposing our analysis.

Motivation: 抑郁症（MDD）患者存在奖励处理异常和注意力问题，需要一种能同时分析决策行为和反应时间的模型。

Method: 结合RL和DDM，使用HMM建模策略切换，分为“专注”和“分心”状态，采用高效的计算算法实现。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解MDD患者的决策行为提供了新视角，并揭示了特定状态下的脑行为关联。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD), a leading cause of disability and mortality,
is associated with reward-processing abnormalities and concentration issues.
Motivated by the probabilistic reward task from the Establishing Moderators and
Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, we
propose a novel framework that integrates the reinforcement learning (RL) model
and drift-diffusion model (DDM) to jointly analyze reward-based decision-making
with response times. To account for emerging evidence suggesting that
decision-making may alternate between multiple interleaved strategies, we model
latent state switching using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the ''engaged''
state, decisions follow an RL-DDM, simultaneously capturing reward processing,
decision dynamics, and temporal structure. In contrast, in the ''lapsed''
state, decision-making is modeled using a simplified DDM, where specific
parameters are fixed to approximate random guessing with equal probability. The
proposed method is implemented using a computationally efficient generalized
expectation-maximization algorithm with forward-backward procedures. Through
extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms competing approaches under various reward-generating distributions,
both with and without strategy switching. When applied to the EMBARC study, our
framework reveals that MDD patients exhibit lower overall engagement than
healthy controls and experience longer decision times when they do engage.
Additionally, we show that neuroimaging measures of brain activities are
associated with decision-making characteristics in the ''engaged'' state but
not in the ''lapsed'' state, providing evidence of brain-behavioral association
specific to the ''engaged'' state.

Conclusion: 该模拟方法在多臂老虎机实验中显著提升了推断的精度和功效，适用于多种常见设计。

Abstract: Multi-arm bandit experimental designs are increasingly being adopted over
standard randomized trials due to their potential to improve outcomes for study
participants, enable faster identification of the best-performing options,
and/or enhance the precision of estimating key parameters. Current approaches
for inference after adaptive sampling either rely on asymptotic normality under
restricted experiment designs or underpowered martingale concentration
inequalities that lead to weak power in practice. To bypass these limitations,
we propose a simulation-based approach for conducting hypothesis tests and
constructing confidence intervals for arm specific means and their differences.
Our simulation-based approach uses positively biased nuisances to generate
additional trajectories of the experiment, which we call \textit{simulation
with optimism}. Using these simulations, we characterize the distribution
potentially non-normal sample mean test statistic to conduct inference. We
provide guarantees for (i) asymptotic type I error control, (ii) convergence of
our confidence intervals, and (iii) asymptotic strong consistency of our
estimator over a wide variety of common bandit designs. Our empirical results
show that our approach achieves the desired coverage while reducing confidence
interval widths by up to 50%, with drastic improvements for arms not targeted
by the design.

Conclusion: TransAct V2通过技术创新解决了工业推荐系统中的关键问题，为长序列建模和高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modeling user action sequences has become a popular focus in industrial
recommendation system research, particularly for Click-Through Rate (CTR)
prediction tasks. However, industry-scale CTR models often rely on short user
sequences, limiting their ability to capture long-term behavior. Additionally,
these models typically lack an integrated action-prediction task within a
point-wise ranking framework, reducing their predictive power. They also rarely
address the infrastructure challenges involved in efficiently serving
large-scale sequential models. In this paper, we introduce TransAct V2, a
production model for Pinterest's Homefeed ranking system, featuring three key
innovations: (1) leveraging very long user sequences to improve CTR
predictions, (2) integrating a Next Action Loss function for enhanced user
action forecasting, and (3) employing scalable, low-latency deployment
solutions tailored to handle the computational demands of extended user action
sequences.

Conclusion: 该方法为CDEs的协调提供了实用解决方案，提升了数据互操作性和选择效率。

Abstract: This research aims to develop a dynamic and scalable framework to facilitate
harmonization of Common Data Elements (CDEs) across heterogeneous biomedical
datasets by addressing challenges such as semantic heterogeneity, structural
variability, and context dependence to streamline integration, enhance
interoperability, and accelerate scientific discovery. Our methodology
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware text embeddings that
convert CDEs into dense vectors capturing semantic relationships and patterns.
These embeddings are clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to group semantically similar
CDEs. The framework incorporates four key steps: (1) LLM-based text embedding
to mathematically represent semantic context, (2) unsupervised clustering of
embeddings via HDBSCAN, (3) automated labeling using LLM summarization, and (4)
supervised learning to train a classifier assigning new or unclustered CDEs to
labeled clusters. Evaluated on the NIH NLM CDE Repository with over 24,000
CDEs, the system identified 118 meaningful clusters at an optimized minimum
cluster size of 20. The classifier achieved 90.46 percent overall accuracy,
performing best in larger categories. External validation against Gravity
Projects Social Determinants of Health domains showed strong agreement
(Adjusted Rand Index 0.52, Normalized Mutual Information 0.78), indicating that
embeddings effectively capture cluster characteristics. This adaptable and
scalable approach offers a practical solution to CDE harmonization, improving
selection efficiency and supporting ongoing data interoperability.

mimicking the flexible, context-aware decision strategies humans exhibit,
neglecting the structured, dynamic, and context-aware mechanisms fundamental to
human behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose RecPO, a preference
optimization framework that models structured feedback and contextual delay to
emulate human-like prioritization in sequential recommendation RecPO exploits
adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal
signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to
distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive
experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only
yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key
characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction,
maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting
contexts.

TL;DR: DeepShop是一个用于评估复杂在线购物场景中网络代理性能的基准测试，包含查询多样性、复杂性和细粒度评估，结果显示现有方法在复杂查询中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能反映真实购物场景的复杂性，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: DeepShop通过生成多样化查询、增加查询复杂性，并采用自动化评估框架来测试代理性能。

Result: RAG方法在复杂查询中表现不佳，其他方法在过滤和排序偏好方面存在挑战，整体成功率低。

Conclusion: DeepShop为深度研究购物代理的发展提供了支持，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Web agents for online shopping have shown great promise in automating user
interactions across e-commerce platforms. Benchmarks for assessing such agents
do not reflect the complexity of real-world shopping scenarios, as they often
consist of overly simple queries with deterministic paths, such as "Find iPhone
15." Real shopping scenarios are inherently more layered, involving
multi-dimensional product attributes, search filters, and user-specific sorting
preferences. To address this gap, we introduce DeepShop, a benchmark designed
to evaluate web agents in complex and realistic online shopping environments.
DeepShop comprises three key components. (1) Query diversity evolution:
Starting from real user queries, we generate diverse queries across five
popular online shopping domains. (2) Query complexity evolution: We further
evolve these queries to increase complexity, considering product attributes,
search filters, and sorting preferences, and classify them into three levels:
easy, medium, and hard, based on the number of evolutions. (3) Fine-grained and
holistic evaluation: We propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses
agent performance in terms of fine-grained aspects (product attributes, search
filters, and sorting preferences) and reports the overall success rate through
holistic evaluation. We conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) methods, web agents, and deep research systems. Results show
that RAG struggles with complex queries due to its lack of web interaction,
while other methods face significant challenges with filters and sorting
preferences, leading to low overall success rates. We also perform
cross-category, complexity-based evaluations and error analyses to support the
advancement of deep research shopping agents.

Conclusion: 最优代理设计是一个复杂但重要的问题，在某些情况下可通过高效算法解决，动态更新代理能提升实际性能。

Abstract: As AI technologies improve, people are increasingly willing to delegate tasks
to AI agents. In many cases, the human decision-maker chooses whether to
delegate to an AI agent based on properties of the specific instance of the
decision-making problem they are facing. Since humans typically lack full
awareness of all the factors relevant to this choice for a given
decision-making instance, they perform a kind of categorization by treating
indistinguishable instances -- those that have the same observable features --
as the same. In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal
algorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important
dimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that
the optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal
standalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem
is not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial,
and illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the
properties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show
that finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However,
we are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in
several broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be
decomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm.
Finally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an
algorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted
by users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal
delegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的激励机制（SD-truthfulness），通过随机占优性确保诚实报告，适用于广泛的单调效用函数，并改进了现有方法的敏感性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激励机制假设代理的效用是线性的，但实际中非线性更常见。需要一种更强的激励机制（SD-truthfulness）来确保诚实报告。

Method: 提出SD-truthfulness概念，通过分数分布的随机占优性激励诚实报告；引入新的EA机制，在二元信号设置下保证SD-truthfulness。

Result: EA机制在理论上保证SD-truthfulness，并在实验中表现出最高的敏感性。

Conclusion: SD-truthfulness是一种更通用的激励机制，EA机制在保证诚实报告的同时提升了敏感性和公平性。

Abstract: Eliciting reliable human feedback is essential for many machine learning
tasks, such as learning from noisy labels and aligning AI systems with human
preferences. Peer prediction mechanisms incentivize truthful reporting without
ground truth verification by scoring agents based on correlations with peers.
Traditional mechanisms, which ensure that truth-telling maximizes the expected
scores in equilibrium, can elicit honest information while assuming agents'
utilities are linear functions of their scores. However, in practice,
non-linear payment rules are usually preferred, or agents' utilities are
inherently non-linear.
  We propose stochastically dominant truthfulness (SD-truthfulness) as a
stronger guarantee: the score distribution of truth-telling stochastically
dominates all other strategies, incentivizing truthful reporting for a wide
range of monotone utility functions. Our first observation is that no existing
peer prediction mechanism naturally satisfies this criterion without strong
assumptions. A simple solution -- rounding scores into binary lotteries -- can
enforce SD-truthfulness, but often degrades sensitivity, a key property related
to fairness and statistical efficiency. We demonstrate how a more careful
application of rounding can better preserve sensitivity. Furthermore, we
introduce a new enforced agreement (EA) mechanism that is theoretically
guaranteed to be SD-truthful in binary-signal settings under mild assumptions,
and empirically achieves the highest sensitivity among all known SD-truthful
mechanisms.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal item pricing for a unit-demand

literature: the sample access model where the learner can obtain a sample of
each item value, and the pricing query model where the learner can set a price
for an item and obtain a binary signal on whether the sampled value of the item
is greater than our proposed price. In this work, we give nearly tight sample
complexity and pricing query complexity of the unit-demand pricing problem.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there
is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to
advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are
pre-trained on time-series signals or region-of-interest (ROI) features, we
propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain
graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation
Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive
learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training.
BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying
parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing
the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain
representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we
integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design,
enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological
and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ
meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization
to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning
conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27
neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric
disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical)
across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000
fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases
and parcellations. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 该模型为未来开发参数化听力损失补偿模型奠定了基础，可通过快速拟合新用户数据恢复正常的神经编码。

Abstract: The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly
non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been
modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more
recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models.
Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory
processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for
training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken
advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory
midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this
model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore
it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.
  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space
of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory
midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised
by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\% of the
explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68%
for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the
art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to
simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the
learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving
crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more
animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen
animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss
compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing
impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the
loop optimisation.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的纹理生成方法存在控制灵活性不足和多视图图像不一致的问题，影响生成质量。

Method: 构建共享条件嵌入空间，实现多模态输入灵活聚合；提出基于图像的CFG方法分解结构与风格信息；利用3D知识生成多视图图像，并通过视图同步和自适应加权模块确保一致性；结合3D感知纹理补全和增强模型生成高质量纹理。

Result: 实验表明，FlexPainter在灵活性和生成质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlexPainter通过多模态引导和一致性优化，实现了高质量纹理生成，为3D建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: Texture map production is an important part of 3D modeling and determines the
rendering quality. Recently, diffusion-based methods have opened a new way for
texture generation. However, restricted control flexibility and limited prompt
modalities may prevent creators from producing desired results. Furthermore,
inconsistencies between generated multi-view images often lead to poor texture
generation quality. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FlexPainter},
a novel texture generation pipeline that enables flexible multi-modal
conditional guidance and achieves highly consistent texture generation. A
shared conditional embedding space is constructed to perform flexible
aggregation between different input modalities. Utilizing such embedding space,
we present an image-based CFG method to decompose structural and style
information, achieving reference image-based stylization. Leveraging the 3D
knowledge within the image diffusion prior, we first generate multi-view images
simultaneously using a grid representation to enhance global understanding.
Meanwhile, we propose a view synchronization and adaptive weighting module
during diffusion sampling to further ensure local consistency. Finally, a
3D-aware texture completion model combined with a texture enhancement model is
used to generate seamless, high-resolution texture maps. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both flexibility and generation quality.

Abstract: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed
for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects
and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily
focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support
physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic
scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they
realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it
contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas,
viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies
prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated
to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected
material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of
physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information,
including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To
facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines
for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their
results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware
modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view
synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models
integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful

Abstract: 3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer
graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated
dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures.
To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward
approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or
sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation
into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized
by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction
models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera
parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a
DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel
viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our
model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and
high-fidelity pose-controlled animation. Experiments show that HumanRAM
significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy,
animation fidelity, and generalization performance on real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究临床变量在疾病预后中的重要性时，统计相关性或机器学习预测重要性可能无法反映其因果关系，因此需要一种能够处理混合类型变量的因果发现方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的计算框架，支持混合类型（分类、数值、二元）临床变量的因果结构发现（CSD）和因果强度评分，应用于心力衰竭（HF）患者队列。

Result: 非线性因果关系的CSD建模比线性模型更有意义；非线性分类器（如梯度提升树）的特征重要性与变量的因果强度高度相关，但不区分因果变量。相关变量可以是HF的因果变量，但很少被识别为效应变量。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于机器学习的预测模型提供了变量的因果解释，有助于更深入地理解临床变量与疾病之间的关系。

Abstract: The importance of clinical variables in the prognosis of the disease is
explained using statistical correlation or machine learning (ML). However, the
predictive importance of these variables may not represent their causal
relationships with diseases. This paper uses clinical variables from a heart
failure (HF) patient cohort to investigate the causal explainability of
important variables obtained in statistical and ML contexts. Due to inherent
regression modeling, popular causal discovery methods strictly assume that the
cause and effect variables are numerical and continuous. This paper proposes a
new computational framework to enable causal structure discovery (CSD) and
score the causal strength of mixed-type (categorical, numerical, binary)
clinical variables for binary disease outcomes. In HF classification, we
investigate the association between the importance rank order of three feature
types: correlated features, features important for ML predictions, and causal
features. Our results demonstrate that CSD modeling for nonlinear causal
relationships is more meaningful than its linear counterparts. Feature
importance obtained from nonlinear classifiers (e.g., gradient-boosting trees)
strongly correlates with the causal strength of variables without
differentiating cause and effect variables. Correlated variables can be causal
for HF, but they are rarely identified as effect variables. These results can
be used to add the causal explanation of variables important for ML-based
prediction modeling.

Abstract: We present a generative learning framework for probabilistic sampling based
on an extension of the Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds (PLoM) approach,
which is designed to generate statistically consistent realizations of a random
vector in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, informed by a limited (yet
representative) set of observations. In its original form, PLoM constructs a
reduced-order probabilistic model by combining three main components: (a)
kernel density estimation to approximate the underlying probability measure,
(b) Diffusion Maps to uncover the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold structure,
and (c) a reduced-order Ito Stochastic Differential Equation (ISDE) to sample
from the learned distribution. A key challenge arises, however, when the number
of available data points N is small and the dimensionality of the diffusion-map
basis approaches N, resulting in overfitting and loss of generalization. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an enabling extension that implements a
synthesis of Double Diffusion Maps -- a technique capable of capturing
multiscale geometric features of the data -- with Geometric Harmonics (GH), a
nonparametric reconstruction method that allows smooth nonlinear interpolation
in high-dimensional ambient spaces. This approach enables us to solve a
full-order ISDE directly in the latent space, preserving the full dynamical
complexity of the system, while leveraging its reduced geometric
representation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are
illustrated through two numerical studies: one based on data generated from
two-dimensional Hermite polynomial functions and another based on high-fidelity
simulations of a detonation wave in a reactive flow.

Abstract: In this work, we consider ranking problems among a finite set of candidates:
for instance, selecting the top-$k$ items among a larger list of candidates or
obtaining the full ranking of all items in the set. These problems are often
unstable, in the sense that estimating a ranking from noisy data can exhibit
high sensitivity to small perturbations. Concretely, if we use data to provide
a score for each item (say, by aggregating preference data over a sample of
users), then for two items with similar scores, small fluctuations in the data
can alter the relative ranking of those items. Many existing theoretical
results for ranking problems assume a separation condition to avoid this
challenge, but real-world data often contains items whose scores are
approximately tied, limiting the applicability of existing theory. To address
this gap, we develop a new algorithmic stability framework for ranking
problems, and propose two novel ranking operators for achieving stable ranking:
the \emph{inflated top-$k$} for the top-$k$ selection problem and the
\emph{inflated full ranking} for ranking the full list. To enable stability,
each method allows for expressing some uncertainty in the output. For both of
these two problems, our proposed methods provide guaranteed stability, with no
assumptions on data distributions and no dependence on the total number of
candidates to be ranked. Experiments on real-world data confirm that the
proposed methods offer stability without compromising the informativeness of
the output.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MoCA的自监督学习框架，用于处理多模态健康数据，无需大量标注数据，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字健康技术生成的多模态数据潜力巨大，但现有监督学习方法依赖昂贵标注数据，限制了应用。

Method: 采用跨模态掩码和Transformer自编码器架构，利用模态内时间相关性和模态间相关性。

Result: MoCA在重建和下游任务中表现优于现有方法，并提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 自监督学习在数字健康和多模态数据中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of digital health technologies has led to the
generation of complex multi-modal data, such as physical activity measurements
simultaneously collected from various sensors of mobile and wearable devices.
These data hold immense potential for advancing health studies, but current
methods predominantly rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled
datasets that are often expensive or impractical to obtain, especially in
clinical studies. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised
learning framework called Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder (MoCA) that
leverages cross-modality masking and the Transformer autoencoder architecture
to utilize both temporal correlations within modalities and cross-modal
correlations between data streams. We also provide theoretical guarantees to
support the effectiveness of the cross-modality masking scheme in MoCA.
Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches in both reconstruction and downstream tasks. We
release open-source code for data processing, pre-training, and downstream
tasks in the supplementary materials. This work highlights the transformative
potential of self-supervised learning in digital health and multi-modal data.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study gradient descent (GD) with a constant stepsize for
$\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression with linearly separable data.
Classical theory suggests small stepsizes to ensure monotonic reduction of the
optimization objective, achieving exponential convergence in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ steps with $\kappa$ being the condition
number. Surprisingly, we show that this can be accelerated to
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ by simply using a large stepsize --
for which the objective evolves nonmonotonically. The acceleration brought by
large stepsizes extends to minimizing the population risk for separable
distributions, improving on the best-known upper bounds on the number of steps
to reach a near-optimum. Finally, we characterize the largest stepsize for the
local convergence of GD, which also determines the global convergence in
special scenarios. Our results extend the analysis of Wu et al. (2024) from
convex settings with minimizers at infinity to strongly convex cases with
finite minimizers.

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉动态多层网络的时空动态，需要一种新方法来更准确地建模这些复杂交互。

Method: TSSDMN采用对称Tucker分解表示潜在节点特征及其交互模式，并通过变分期望最大化算法进行高效推断。

Result: 数值模拟和案例研究表明TSSDMN能有效理解动态多层网络。

Conclusion: TSSDMN为动态多层网络的建模提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is
critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often
fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper
introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks
(TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric
Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction
patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and
allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures
both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model
identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as
variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field
variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization
algorithm is developed for efficient model inference. Numerical simulations and
case studies demonstrate the efficacy of TSSDMN for understanding dynamic
multilayer networks.

Result: 发现训练分为两个阶段：从无信息初始化逃逸和与目标子空间对齐，序列长度和位置编码影响收敛速度和学习轨迹。

Conclusion: 为理解基于注意力的模型如何受益于数据中的序列结构提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for a class of
sequence models termed Sequence Single-Index (SSI) models, where the target
depends on a single direction in input space applied to a sequence of tokens.
This setting generalizes classical single-index models to the sequential
domain, encompassing simplified one-layer attention architectures. We derive a
closed-form expression for the population loss in terms of a pair of sufficient
statistics capturing semantic and positional alignment, and characterize the
induced high-dimensional SGD dynamics for these coordinates. Our analysis
reveals two distinct training phases: escape from uninformative initialization
and alignment with the target subspace, and demonstrates how the sequence
length and positional encoding influence convergence speed and learning
trajectories. These results provide a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
understanding how sequential structure in data can be beneficial for learning
with attention-based models.

Result: 贝叶斯方法能有效恢复，联合学习性能下降；顺序学习策略达到最优弱恢复阈值。

Conclusion: 结构相关性和学习顺序在多模态高维推理中至关重要，顺序课程学习是有效策略。

Abstract: We study the recovery of multiple high-dimensional signals from two noisy,
correlated modalities: a spiked matrix and a spiked tensor sharing a common
low-rank structure. This setting generalizes classical spiked matrix and tensor
models, unveiling intricate interactions between inference channels and
surprising algorithmic behaviors. Notably, while the spiked tensor model is
typically intractable at low signal-to-noise ratios, its correlation with the
matrix enables efficient recovery via Bayesian Approximate Message Passing,
inducing staircase-like phase transitions reminiscent of neural network
phenomena. In contrast, empirical risk minimization for joint learning fails:
the tensor component obstructs effective matrix recovery, and joint
optimization significantly degrades performance, highlighting the limitations
of naive multi-modal learning. We show that a simple Sequential Curriculum
Learning strategy-first recovering the matrix, then leveraging it to guide
tensor recovery-resolves this bottleneck and achieves optimal weak recovery
thresholds. This strategy, implementable with spectral methods, emphasizes the
critical role of structural correlation and learning order in multi-modal
high-dimensional inference.

Result: SA-GFN实现了无偏采样，提高了多样性，并生成与目标分布匹配的高奖励图。

Conclusion: SA-GFN通过奖励结构调整有效解决了偏差问题，提升了生成图的多样性和准确性。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) offer a powerful framework for sampling
graphs in proportion to their rewards. However, existing approaches suffer from
systematic biases due to inaccuracies in state transition probability
computations. These biases, rooted in the inherent symmetries of graphs, impact
both atom-based and fragment-based generation schemes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets (SA-GFN), a method that
incorporates symmetry corrections into the learning process through reward
scaling. By integrating bias correction directly into the reward structure,
SA-GFN eliminates the need for explicit state transition computations.
Empirical results show that SA-GFN enables unbiased sampling while enhancing
diversity and consistently generating high-reward graphs that closely match the
target distribution.

Abstract: We address the problem of safely learning controlled stochastic dynamics from
discrete-time trajectory observations, ensuring system trajectories remain
within predefined safe regions during both training and deployment.
Safety-critical constraints of this kind are crucial in applications such as
autonomous robotics, finance, and biomedicine. We introduce a method that
ensures safe exploration and efficient estimation of system dynamics by
iteratively expanding an initial known safe control set using kernel-based
confidence bounds. After training, the learned model enables predictions of the
system's dynamics and permits safety verification of any given control. Our
approach requires only mild smoothness assumptions and access to an initial
safe control set, enabling broad applicability to complex real-world systems.
We provide theoretical guarantees for safety and derive adaptive learning rates
that improve with increasing Sobolev regularity of the true dynamics.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method
in terms of safety, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CPME为反事实政策评估提供了灵活、非参数化的解决方案，支持高效计算和置信区间构建。

Abstract: Estimating the distribution of outcomes under counterfactual policies is
critical for decision-making in domains such as recommendation, advertising,
and healthcare. We analyze a novel framework-Counterfactual Policy Mean
Embedding (CPME)-that represents the entire counterfactual outcome distribution
in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), enabling flexible and
nonparametric distributional off-policy evaluation. We introduce both a plug-in
estimator and a doubly robust estimator; the latter enjoys improved uniform
convergence rates by correcting for bias in both the outcome embedding and
propensity models. Building on this, we develop a doubly robust kernel test
statistic for hypothesis testing, which achieves asymptotic normality and thus
enables computationally efficient testing and straightforward construction of
confidence intervals. Our framework also supports sampling from the
counterfactual distribution. Numerical simulations illustrate the practical
benefits of CPME over existing methods.

Conclusion: OmniMatch在多图匹配和顶点对齐任务中表现优异，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: We present the OmniMatch algorithm for seeded multiple graph matching. In the
setting of $d$-dimensional Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG), we prove that
under mild assumptions, OmniMatch with $s$ seeds asymptotically and efficiently
perfectly aligns $O(s^{\alpha})$ unseeded vertices -- for $\alpha<2\wedge d/4$
-- across multiple networks even in the presence of no edge correlation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across numerous simulations and
in the context of shuffled graph hypothesis testing. In the shuffled testing
setting, testing power is lost due to the misalignment/shuffling of vertices
across graphs, and we demonstrate the capacity of OmniMatch to correct for
misaligned vertices prior to testing and hence recover the lost testing power.
We further demonstrate the algorithm on a pair of data examples from
connectomics and machine translation.

Result: TEWA-SE在强凸损失下对已知S和Δ实现极小极大最优；cExO在一般凸损失下对已知S和Δ最优，且对P改进现有界。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在非平稳环境下显著优化了后悔界，TEWA-SE适用于强凸损失，cExO适用于一般凸损失。

Abstract: Bandit Convex Optimization is a fundamental class of sequential
decision-making problems, where the learner selects actions from a continuous
domain and observes a loss (but not its gradient) at only one point per round.
We study this problem in non-stationary environments, and aim to minimize the
regret under three standard measures of non-stationarity: the number of
switches $S$ in the comparator sequence, the total variation $\Delta$ of the
loss functions, and the path-length $P$ of the comparator sequence. We propose
a polynomial-time algorithm, Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average with
Sleeping Experts (TEWA-SE), which adapts the sleeping experts framework from
online convex optimization to the bandit setting. For strongly convex losses,
we prove that TEWA-SE is minimax-optimal with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$
by establishing matching upper and lower bounds. By equipping TEWA-SE with the
Bandit-over-Bandit framework, we extend our analysis to environments with
unknown non-stationarity measures. For general convex losses, we introduce a
second algorithm, clipped Exploration by Optimization (cExO), based on
exponential weights over a discretized action space. While not polynomial-time
computable, this method achieves minimax-optimal regret with respect to known
$S$ and $\Delta$, and improves on the best existing bounds with respect to $P$.

Abstract: We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized
low-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it
employs a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix
Catoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds,
surpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and
reveal a novel experimental design objective, $\mathrm{GL}(\pi)$. The key
technical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link
function, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local*
minimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise
optimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications
include generalized linear matrix completion, where `GL-LowPopArt` achieves a
state-of-the-art Frobenius error guarantee, and **bilinear dueling bandits**, a
novel setting inspired by general preference learning (Zhang et al., 2024). Our
analysis of a `GL-LowPopArt`-based explore-then-commit algorithm reveals a new,
potentially interesting problem-dependent quantity, along with improved Borda
regret bound than vectorization (Wu et al., 2024).

Abstract: Many identity systems assign a single, static identifier to an individual for
life, reused across domains like healthcare, finance, and education. These
Universal Lifelong Identifiers (ULIs) underpin critical workflows but now pose
systemic privacy risks. We take the position that ULIs are fundamentally
incompatible with the AI era and must be phased out. We articulate a threat
model grounded in modern AI capabilities and show that traditional safeguards
such as redaction, consent, and access controls are no longer sufficient. We
define core properties for identity systems in the AI era and present a
cryptographic framework that satisfies them while retaining compatibility with
existing identifier workflows. Our design preserves institutional workflows,
supports essential functions such as auditability and delegation, and offers a
practical migration path beyond ULIs.

Conclusion: 差异访问策略能有效增强防御优势，未来需进一步研究其应用。

Abstract: As AI-enabled cyber capabilities become more advanced, we propose
"differential access" as a strategy to tilt the cybersecurity balance toward
defense by shaping access to these capabilities. We introduce three possible
approaches that form a continuum, becoming progressively more restrictive for
higher-risk capabilities: Promote Access, Manage Access, and Deny by Default.
However, a key principle across all approaches is the need to prioritize
defender access, even in the most restrictive scenarios, so that defenders can
prepare for adversaries gaining access to similar capabilities. This report
provides a process to help frontier AI developers choose and implement one of
the three differential access approaches, including considerations based on a
model's cyber capabilities, a defender's maturity and role, and strategic and
technical implementation details. We also present four example schemes for
defenders to reference, demonstrating how differential access provides value
across various capability and defender levels, and suggest directions for
further research.

Conclusion: 强调从初期实施安全协议的重要性，以应对MLOps生态系统的安全威胁。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has driven
organizations across diverse sectors to seek efficient and reliable methods to
accelerate model development-to-deployment. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
has emerged as an integrative approach addressing these requirements by
unifying relevant roles and streamlining ML workflows. As the MLOps market
continues to grow, securing these pipelines has become increasingly critical.
However, the unified nature of MLOps ecosystem introduces vulnerabilities,
making them susceptible to adversarial attacks where a single misconfiguration
can lead to compromised credentials, severe financial losses, damaged public
trust, and the poisoning of training data. Our paper presents a systematic
application of the MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for
Artificial-Intelligence Systems) framework, a comprehensive and continuously
updated catalog of AI-focused attacks, to systematically assess attacks across
different phases of the MLOps ecosystem. We begin by examining the preparatory
phases during which adversaries acquire the essential intelligence required to
initiate their attacks. We then present a structured taxonomy of attack
techniques explicitly mapped to corresponding phases of the MLOps ecosystem,
supported by examples drawn from red-teaming exercises and real-world
incidents. This is followed by a taxonomy of mitigation strategies aligned with
these attack categories, offering actionable early-stage defenses to strengthen
the security of MLOps ecosystem. Given the rapid evolution and adoption of
MLOps, we further highlight key research gaps that require immediate attention.
Our work emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security protocols
from the outset, empowering practitioners to safeguard MLOps ecosystem against
evolving cyber attacks.

Method: 使用“random-crypto”框架生成密码学CTF挑战，并通过GRPO方法微调Llama-3.1-8B模型，使其能够在隔离环境中迭代编写和执行Python代码。

Result: 在未见过的“random-crypto”任务中，Pass@8提升了53%，Majority@8达到0.41；在外部数据集（picoCTF）上，Pass@8提升了13个百分点。

Conclusion: GRPO方法通过更可靠的工具调用和代码合成显著提升了模型性能，而非仅依赖提示优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with the structured reasoning and
tool-assisted computation needed for problem solving in cybersecurity
applications. In this work, we introduce "random-crypto", a cryptographic
Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge generator framework that we use to fine-tune a
tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B with Guided Reinforcement Prompt Optimisation
(GRPO), allowing the agent to iteratively write and execute Python inside an
isolated REPL. GRPO yields a +53% absolute jump in Pass@8 on unseen
"random-crypto" tasks (0.35 -> 0.88) and raises Majority@8 to 0.41. The
fine-tuned agent also generalizes to an external dataset. On a subset of
picoCTF cryptography problems, it improves Pass@8 by +13 pp. Ablations show the
gains stem from more reliable tool invocation and code synthesis, rather than
superficial prompt adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖OOD样本假设，但在现实场景中效果有限，需要一种更可靠的防御策略。

Result: 实验验证了MISLEADER在保持预测准确性的同时有效抵抗模型提取攻击。

Conclusion: MISLEADER为模型保护提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Model extraction attacks aim to replicate the functionality of a black-box
model through query access, threatening the intellectual property (IP) of
machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) providers. Defending against such attacks
is challenging, as it must balance efficiency, robustness, and utility
preservation in the real-world scenario. Despite the recent advances, most
existing defenses presume that attacker queries have out-of-distribution (OOD)
samples, enabling them to detect and disrupt suspicious inputs. However, this
assumption is increasingly unreliable, as modern models are trained on diverse
datasets and attackers often operate under limited query budgets. As a result,
the effectiveness of these defenses is significantly compromised in realistic
deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we propose MISLEADER (enseMbles of
dIStiLled modEls Against moDel ExtRaction), a novel defense strategy that does
not rely on OOD assumptions. MISLEADER formulates model protection as a bilevel
optimization problem that simultaneously preserves predictive fidelity on
benign inputs and reduces extractability by potential clone models. Our
framework combines data augmentation to simulate attacker queries with an
ensemble of heterogeneous distilled models to improve robustness and diversity.
We further provide a tractable approximation algorithm and derive theoretical
error bounds to characterize defense effectiveness. Extensive experiments
across various settings validate the utility-preserving and
extraction-resistant properties of our proposed defense strategy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/LabRAI/MISLEADER.

Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) serves as a critical enabler for privacy-preserving
systems by providing AI-empowered computation and distributed caching services
at the edge, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing data privacy. The
integration of blockchain technology further augments EI frameworks by ensuring
transactional transparency, auditability, and system-wide reliability through a
decentralized network model. However, the operational architecture of such
systems introduces inherent vulnerabilities, particularly due to the extensive
data interactions between edge gateways (EGs) and the distributed nature of
information storage during service provisioning. To address these challenges,
we propose an autonomous computing model along with its interaction topologies
tailored for privacy-critical and time-sensitive health applications. The
system supports continuous monitoring, real-time alert notifications, disease
detection, and robust data processing and aggregation. It also includes a data
transaction handler and mechanisms for ensuring privacy at the EGs. Moreover, a
resource-efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is
proposed for the multiclass classification of arrhythmia, enabling accurate and
real-time analysis of constrained EGs. Furthermore, a secure access scheme is
defined to manage both off-chain and on-chain data sharing and storage. To
validate the proposed model, comprehensive security, performance, and cost
analyses are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of the
fine-grained access control scheme.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球对技术和自动化流程的依赖增加，确保系统和网络安全成为重要问题，IDS通过检测和防止非法访问保护网络。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析了多种机器学习分类器（如SVM、KNN、DT等）在IDS中的应用，并对常用数据集（如KDDCUP'99、NSL-KDD等）进行了评估。

Abstract: IDS aims to protect computer networks from security threats by detecting,
notifying, and taking appropriate action to prevent illegal access and protect
confidential information. As the globe becomes increasingly dependent on
technology and automated processes, ensuring secured systems, applications, and
networks has become one of the most significant problems of this era. The
global web and digital technology have significantly accelerated the evolution
of the modern world, necessitating the use of telecommunications and data
transfer platforms. Researchers are enhancing the effectiveness of IDS by
incorporating popular datasets into machine learning algorithms. IDS, equipped
with machine learning classifiers, enhances security attack detection accuracy
by identifying normal or abnormal network traffic. This paper explores the
methods of capturing and reviewing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and
evaluates the challenges existing datasets face. A deluge of research on
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) architecture-based intrusion
detection techniques has been conducted in the past ten years on various
cybersecurity datasets, including KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CICIDS-2017,
and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. We conducted a literature review and presented an in-depth
analysis of various intrusion detection methods that use SVM, KNN, DT, LR, NB,
RF, XGBOOST, Adaboost, and ANN. We provide an overview of each technique,
explaining the role of the classifiers and algorithms used. A detailed tabular
analysis highlights the datasets used, classifiers employed, attacks detected,
evaluation metrics, and conclusions drawn. This article offers a thorough
review for future IDS research.

*Zhun Wang,Tianneng Shi,Jingxuan He,Matthew Cai,Jialin Zhang,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyberGym是一个大规模、高质量的网络安全评估框架，用于评估LLM代理在生成漏洞复现的PoC测试中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估LLM代理在真实网络安全任务中的表现，亟需一个更全面的评估框架。

Method: CyberGym包含1,507个真实漏洞，要求LLM代理基于文本描述和源代码生成PoC测试。

Result: 最佳组合（OpenHands和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）的复现成功率仅为11.9%，但生成的PoC还发现了15个零日漏洞。

Conclusion: CyberGym填补了评估LLM代理网络安全能力的空白，并展示了其在发现新漏洞方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly skilled at
handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly assessing their
cybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in
this domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture
real-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we
introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation
framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across
188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings,
CyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests
for vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding
source repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it
requires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant
code fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target
vulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best
combination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9%
reproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing
historical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can
reveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest
versions of the software projects.

TL;DR: 论文提出ATAG框架，用于系统评估多智能体系统中LLM的安全风险，扩展了MulVAL工具，并创建了LVD数据库。案例研究表明其能有效建模复杂攻击场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MASs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全评估具有挑战性，传统攻击图方法无法准确建模LLM漏洞。

Method: 提出ATAG框架，扩展MulVAL工具，加入自定义事实和交互规则，并创建LLM漏洞数据库（LVD）。

Result: ATAG成功应用于两个多智能体应用，能建模复杂多步攻击场景，如提示注入、敏感信息泄露等。

Conclusion: ATAG为多智能体AI系统提供了理解、可视化和优先处理复杂攻击路径的方法，有助于主动识别和缓解威胁。

Abstract: Evaluating the security of multi-agent systems (MASs) powered by large
language models (LLMs) is challenging, primarily because of the systems'
complex internal dynamics and the evolving nature of LLM vulnerabilities.
Traditional attack graph (AG) methods often lack the specific capabilities to
model attacks on LLMs. This paper introduces AI-agent application Threat
assessment with Attack Graphs (ATAG), a novel framework designed to
systematically analyze the security risks associated with AI-agent
applications. ATAG extends the MulVAL logic-based AG generation tool with
custom facts and interaction rules to accurately represent AI-agent topologies,
vulnerabilities, and attack scenarios. As part of this research, we also
created the LLM vulnerability database (LVD) to initiate the process of
standardizing LLM vulnerabilities documentation. To demonstrate ATAG's
efficacy, we applied it to two multi-agent applications. Our case studies
demonstrated the framework's ability to model and generate AGs for
sophisticated, multi-step attack scenarios exploiting vulnerabilities such as
prompt injection, excessive agency, sensitive information disclosure, and
insecure output handling across interconnected agents. ATAG is an important
step toward a robust methodology and toolset to help understand, visualize, and
prioritize complex attack paths in multi-agent AI systems (MAASs). It
facilitates proactive identification and mitigation of AI-agent threats in
multi-agent applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于Frank-Wolfe方法和投影梯度下降的加速梯度方法在隐私和重尾鲁棒性方面的优势，通过优化学习率和梯度下界减少迭代复杂度，并在不同数据设置下验证了统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索加速梯度方法在隐私保护和重尾数据鲁棒性中的应用潜力，以提升统计学习任务的效率与安全性。

Method: 针对Frank-Wolfe方法采用定制学习率和梯度下界；对投影梯度下降使用Nesterov动量加速，并在高维空间优化目标函数。通过高斯机制和几何中位数均值估计器分别实现差分隐私和重尾鲁棒性。

Result: 加速方法显著降低了迭代复杂度，并在非随机数据、随机无模型数据和参数模型（如线性回归和广义线性模型）中表现出更强的统计保证。

Conclusion: 本文方法在特定场景下达到最优收敛速率，为隐私保护和重尾鲁棒性提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the advantages of accelerated gradient methods, specifically based
on the Frank-Wolfe method and projected gradient descent, for privacy and
heavy-tailed robustness. Our approaches are as follows: For the Frank-Wolfe
method, our technique is based on a tailored learning rate and a uniform lower
bound on the gradient of the $\ell_2$-norm over the constraint set. For
accelerating projected gradient descent, we use the popular variant based on
Nesterov's momentum, and we optimize our objective over $\mathbb{R}^p$. These
accelerations reduce iteration complexity, translating into stronger
statistical guarantees for empirical and population risk minimization. Our
analysis covers three settings: non-random data, random model-free data, and
parametric models (linear regression and generalized linear models).
Methodologically, we approach both privacy and robustness based on noisy
gradients. We ensure differential privacy via the Gaussian mechanism and
advanced composition, and we achieve heavy-tailed robustness using a geometric
median-of-means estimator, which also sharpens the dependency on the dimension
of the covariates. Finally, we compare our rates to existing bounds and
identify scenarios where our methods attain optimal convergence.

TL;DR: 该研究对terraPulse公司提供的AGBD数据集进行了独立验证，使用美国森林服务局的FIA数据作为参考，结果显示两者在区域尺度上具有高度一致性，但也指出了在非森林区和高生物量森林中的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率监测地上生物量（AGB）及其密度（AGBD）对碳核算和生态系统管理至关重要。然而，基于GEDI的商业遥感产品缺乏严格的独立验证。

Method: 研究使用FIA数据作为独立参考，对terraPulse的AGBD数据集进行验证，通过空间和统计分析比较两者在六边形和县级尺度上的表现。

Result: 在六边形尺度上，R²=0.88，RMSE=26.68 Mg/ha，r=0.94；在县级尺度上，R²=0.90，RMSE=32.62 Mg/ha，r=0.95。非森林区和高生物量森林存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究为全球生物量监测提供了一个可扩展的验证框架，并验证了terraPulse数据集的有效性，推动了碳监测的实用化。

Abstract: Monitoring aboveground biomass (AGB) and its density (AGBD) at high
resolution is essential for carbon accounting and ecosystem management. While
NASA's spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR mission
provides globally distributed reference measurements for AGBD estimation, the
majority of commercial remote sensing products based on GEDI remain without
rigorous or independent validation. Here, we present an independent regional
validation of an AGBD dataset offered by terraPulse, Inc., based on independent
reference data from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
program. Aggregated to 64,000-hectare hexagons and US counties across the US
states of Utah, Nevada, and Washington, we found very strong agreement between
terraPulse and FIA estimates. At the hexagon scale, we report R2 = 0.88, RMSE =
26.68 Mg/ha, and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.94. At the county scale,
agreement improves to R2 = 0.90, RMSE =32.62 Mg/ha, slope = 1.07, and r = 0.95.
Spatial and statistical analyses indicated that terraPulse AGBD values tended
to exceed FIA estimates in non-forest areas, likely due to FIA's limited
sampling of non-forest vegetation. The terraPulse AGBD estimates also exhibited
lower values in high-biomass forests, likely due to saturation effects in its
optical remote-sensing covariates. This study advances operational carbon
monitoring by delivering a scalable framework for comprehensive AGBD validation
using independent FIA data, as well as a benchmark validation of a new
commercial dataset for global biomass monitoring.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合深度学习和多元GARCH的新型波动率建模框架LSTM-BEKK，旨在更好地捕捉金融数据中的非线性动态依赖结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多元GARCH方法在捕捉持续波动聚类和资产间不对称联动方面存在局限性，因此需要一种更灵活且适应性强的模型。

Method: 通过将LSTM的灵活性与BEKK模型的计量结构相结合，提出LSTM-BEKK框架，利用数据驱动的LSTM适应时变市场条件。

Result: 实证结果表明，LSTM-BEKK在样本外组合风险预测中表现优异，同时保持了BEKK模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 混合计量经济学-深度学习模型在金融风险管理和多元波动率预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multivariate volatility modeling framework,
named Long Short-Term Memory enhanced BEKK (LSTM-BEKK), that integrates deep
learning into multivariate GARCH processes. By combining the flexibility of
recurrent neural networks with the econometric structure of BEKK models, our
approach is designed to better capture nonlinear, dynamic, and high-dimensional
dependence structures in financial return data. The proposed model addresses
key limitations of traditional multivariate GARCH-based methods, particularly
in capturing persistent volatility clustering and asymmetric co-movement across
assets. Leveraging the data-driven nature of LSTMs, the framework adapts
effectively to time-varying market conditions, offering improved robustness and
forecasting performance. Empirical results across multiple equity markets
confirm that the LSTM-BEKK model achieves superior performance in terms of
out-of-sample portfolio risk forecast, while maintaining the interpretability
from the BEKK models. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid
econometric-deep learning models in advancing financial risk management and
multivariate volatility forecasting.

Motivation: 移动边缘计算（MEC）需要高效的计算卸载策略，但传统DDPG算法存在固有弱点，因此需要改进方法。

Method: 采用Twin Delayed DDPG算法，为每个用户独立学习计算卸载策略，解决传统DDPG的不足。

Result: 数值结果表明，用户能自主学会有效策略，且新方法性能优于传统DDPG。

Conclusion: 提出的Twin Delayed DDPG方法在MEC系统中表现更优，适用于移动用户场景。

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows appliances to offload workloads to
neighboring MEC servers that have the potential for computation-intensive tasks
with limited computational capabilities. This paper studied how deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are used in an MEC system to find
feasible decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategies, which leads
to the construction of an extensible MEC system that operates effectively with
finite feedback. Even though the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
algorithm, subject to their knowledge of the MEC system, can be used to
allocate powers of both computation offloading and local execution, to learn a
computation offloading policy for each user independently, we realized that
this solution still has some inherent weaknesses. Hence, we introduced a new
approach for this problem based on the Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm, which
enables us to overcome this proneness and investigate cases where mobile users
are portable. Numerical results showed that individual users can autonomously
learn adequate policies through the proposed approach. Besides, the performance
of the suggested solution exceeded the conventional DDPG-based power control
strategy.

Result: C2E在多种手术ML任务中表现出强泛化能力，如工作流分类、工具-组织交互分类、分割和诊断任务。

Conclusion: C2E展示了自监督学习在提升手术AI性能和改善微创手术结果方面的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time video understanding is critical to guide procedures in minimally
invasive surgery (MIS). However, supervised learning approaches require large,
annotated datasets that are scarce due to annotation efforts that are
prohibitive, e.g., in medical fields. Although self-supervision methods can
address such limitations, current self-supervised methods often fail to capture
structural and physical information in a form that generalizes across tasks. We
propose Compress-to-Explore (C2E), a novel self-supervised framework that
leverages Kolmogorov complexity to learn compact, informative representations
from surgical videos. C2E uses entropy-maximizing decoders to compress images
while preserving clinically relevant details, improving encoder performance
without labeled data. Trained on large-scale unlabeled surgical datasets, C2E
demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of surgical ML tasks, such
as workflow classification, tool-tissue interaction classification,
segmentation, and diagnosis tasks, providing improved performance as a surgical
visual foundation model. As we further show in the paper, the model's internal
compact representation better disentangles features from different structural
parts of images. The resulting performance improvements highlight the yet
untapped potential of self-supervised learning to enhance surgical AI and
improve outcomes in MIS.

Abstract: Previous works in the literature apply 3D spatial-only models on 4D

for downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we aim to develop a
novel 4D convolution network to extract 4D joint temporal-spatial kernels that
not only learn spatial information but in addition also capture temporal

spatial-temporal data in functional MRI compared to 3D models. The 4D CNN model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如SSIM和PSNR）在稀疏视图CT重建中未能充分捕捉关键解剖结构的完整性，尤其是小或薄区域。

Method: 提出解剖感知评估指标，并开发CARE框架，通过结构惩罚在训练中增强解剖结构的保留。

Result: CARE显著提升了CT重建的结构完整性，大器官提升32%，小器官22%，肠道40%，血管36%。

Conclusion: CARE框架有效解决了现有评估指标的局限性，显著改善了CT重建的解剖结构完整性。

Abstract: Widely adopted evaluation metrics for sparse-view CT reconstruction--such as
Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio--prioritize
pixel-wise fidelity but often fail to capture the completeness of critical
anatomical structures, particularly small or thin regions that are easily
missed. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of novel anatomy-aware
evaluation metrics designed to assess structural completeness across anatomical
structures, including large organs, small organs, intestines, and vessels.
Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware
Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties
during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures.
CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical,
implicit, and generative methods. When applied to these methods, CARE
substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving
up to +32% improvement for large organs, +22% for small organs, +40% for
intestines, and +36% for vessels.

Conclusion: DEFFA-Unet通过改进特征提取和数据增强，显著提升了视网膜血管分割的精度和泛化能力，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Retinal blood vessel segmentation is crucial for diagnosing ocular and
cardiovascular diseases. Although the introduction of U-Net in 2015 by Olaf
Ronneberger significantly advanced this field, yet issues like limited training
data, imbalance data distribution, and inadequate feature extraction persist,
hindering both the segmentation performance and optimal model generalization.
Addressing these critical issues, the DEFFA-Unet is proposed featuring an
additional encoder to process domain-invariant pre-processed inputs, thereby
improving both richer feature encoding and enhanced model generalization. A
feature filtering fusion module is developed to ensure the precise feature
filtering and robust hybrid feature fusion. In response to the task-specific
need for higher precision where false positives are very costly, traditional
skip connections are replaced with the attention-guided feature reconstructing
fusion module. Additionally, innovative data augmentation and balancing methods
are proposed to counter data scarcity and distribution imbalance, further
boosting the robustness and generalization of the model. With a comprehensive
suite of evaluation metrics, extensive validations on four benchmark datasets
(DRIVE, CHASEDB1, STARE, and HRF) and an SLO dataset (IOSTAR), demonstrate the
proposed method's superiority over both baseline and state-of-the-art models.
Particularly the proposed method significantly outperforms the compared methods
in cross-validation model generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床CT场景（如低剂量扫描、稀疏视图扫描和金属植入物）常导致重建图像中出现严重噪声和伪影，需要改进重建技术。尽管深度学习已显著推进CT图像重建，但获取配对训练数据仍具挑战性，且数据不一致性可能导致模型幻觉。

Method: 论文将数据保真度与先进的生成AI模型PFGM++结合，提出了新型CT框架FORCE。

Result: 实验表明，FORCE在多种CT成像任务中表现优异，优于现有无监督重建方法。

Conclusion: FORCE框架通过结合PFGM++和数据保真度，有效解决了CT图像重建中的幻觉问题，并在性能上超越现有方法。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a major medical imaging modality. Clinical CT
scenarios, such as low-dose screening, sparse-view scanning, and metal
implants, often lead to severe noise and artifacts in reconstructed images,
requiring improved reconstruction techniques. The introduction of deep learning
has significantly advanced CT image reconstruction. However, obtaining paired
training data remains rather challenging due to patient motion and other
constraints. Although deep learning methods can still perform well with
approximately paired data, they inherently carry the risk of hallucination due
to data inconsistencies and model instability. In this paper, we integrate the
data fidelity with the state-of-the-art generative AI model, referred to as the
Poisson flow generative model (PFGM) with a generalized version PFGM++, and
propose a novel CT framework: Flow-Oriented Reconstruction Conditioning Engine
(FORCE). In our experiments, the proposed method shows superior performance in
various CT imaging tasks, outperforming existing unsupervised reconstruction
approaches.

*Songlin Wei,Gene Cheung,Fei Chen,Ivan Selesnick*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的非凸图总变分（NC-GTV）方法用于图像去噪，通过结合ℓ₂范数保真项，确保目标函数为凸且无额外局部极小值。采用基于图的Huber函数定义NC-GTV，并通过Gershgorin Circle定理高效计算关键参数。设计了一个基于ADMM的线性时间算法，并将其展开为轻量级前馈网络进行参数学习。实验表明，该方法优于其他代表性去噪方案且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的图像去噪方法使用凸正则化项（如TV），而本文提出非凸图总变分（NC-GTV）以提升稀疏信号表示，同时确保目标函数为凸。

Method: 1. 定义基于图的Huber函数的NC-GTV；2. 通过Gershgorin Circle定理计算关键参数a；3. 设计基于ADMM的线性时间算法并展开为轻量级网络。

Result: 实验表明，NC-GTV在图像去噪中优于其他方法，且网络参数更少。

Conclusion: NC-GTV方法在确保目标函数为凸的同时，显著提升了图像去噪性能，且具有高效性和轻量级特点。

Abstract: Conventional model-based image denoising optimizations employ convex
regularization terms, such as total variation (TV) that convexifies the
$\ell_0$-norm to promote sparse signal representation. Instead, we propose a
new non-convex total variation term in a graph setting (NC-GTV), such that when
combined with an $\ell_2$-norm fidelity term for denoising, leads to a convex
objective with no extraneous local minima. We define NC-GTV using a new graph
variant of the Huber function, interpretable as a Moreau envelope. The crux is
the selection of a parameter $a$ characterizing the graph Huber function that
ensures overall objective convexity; we efficiently compute $a$ via an
adaptation of Gershgorin Circle Theorem (GCT). To minimize the convex
objective, we design a linear-time algorithm based on Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and unroll it into a lightweight feed-forward
network for data-driven parameter learning. Experiments show that our method
outperforms unrolled GTV and other representative image denoising schemes,
while employing far fewer network parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用SwinUNETR合成脑部MRI缺失模态，结合Swin Transformer和CNN的优势，显著提升图像质量和诊断价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中脑部MRI模态缺失是常见问题，需要有效方法合成缺失模态以提供完整诊断信息。

Method: 采用SwinUNETR架构，结合Swin Transformer的全局上下文能力和CNN的局部细节捕捉能力，生成合成图像。

Result: 在脑部MRI数据集上表现优异，显著提升图像质量、解剖一致性和诊断价值。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR能有效合成缺失MRI模态，为临床诊断提供高质量图像。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in
clinical diagnostics by providing complementary information across different
imaging modalities. However, a common challenge in clinical practice is missing
MRI modalities. In this paper, we apply SwinUNETR to the synthesize of missing
modalities in brain MRI. SwinUNETR is a novel neural network architecture
designed for medical image analysis, integrating the strengths of Swin
Transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Swin Transformer, a
variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT), incorporates hierarchical feature
extraction and window-based self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to capture
both local and global contextual information effectively. By combining the Swin
Transformer with CNNs, SwinUNETR merges global context awareness with detailed
spatial resolution. This hybrid approach addresses the challenges posed by the
varying modality characteristics and complex brain structures, facilitating the
generation of accurate and realistic synthetic images. We evaluate the
performance of SwinUNETR on brain MRI datasets and demonstrate its superior
capability in generating clinically valuable images. Our results show
significant improvements in image quality, anatomical consistency, and
diagnostic value.

Result: 实验验证了TSRNet在恢复高质量图像方面的优越性。

Conclusion: TSRNet通过树架构和跨域信息提取，显著提升了图像超分辨率性能。

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can extract more accurate structural
information via deep architectures to obtain good performance in image
super-resolution. However, it is not easy to find effect of important layers in
a single network architecture to decrease performance of super-resolution. In
this paper, we design a tree-guided CNN for image super-resolution (TSRNet). It
uses a tree architecture to guide a deep network to enhance effect of key nodes
to amplify the relation of hierarchical information for improving the ability
of recovering images. To prevent insufficiency of the obtained structural
information, cosine transform techniques in the TSRNet are used to extract
cross-domain information to improve the performance of image super-resolution.
Adaptive Nesterov momentum optimizer (Adan) is applied to optimize parameters
to boost effectiveness of training a super-resolution model. Extended
experiments can verify superiority of the proposed TSRNet for restoring
high-quality images. Its code can be obtained at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于支持样本的深度学习方法SSIPNet，利用少量音频-分数对预测个性化语音清晰度，效果优于传统听力图方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力图方法仅基于纯音阈值，准确性有限，需更精准的个性化语音清晰度预测方法。

Method: 引入SSIPNet，利用语音基础模型从多个支持样本（音频、分数对）构建高维表示，预测新音频的清晰度。

Result: 在Clarity Prediction Challenge数据集上，即使支持样本较少，SSIPNet仍优于听力图方法。

Conclusion: SSIPNet为个性化语音清晰度预测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Personalized speech intelligibility prediction is challenging. Previous
approaches have mainly relied on audiograms, which are inherently limited in
accuracy as they only capture a listener's hearing threshold for pure tones.
Rather than incorporating additional listener features, we propose a novel
approach that leverages an individual's existing intelligibility data to
predict their performance on new audio. We introduce the Support Sample-Based
Intelligibility Prediction Network (SSIPNet), a deep learning model that
leverages speech foundation models to build a high-dimensional representation
of a listener's speech recognition ability from multiple support (audio, score)
pairs, enabling accurate predictions for unseen audio. Results on the Clarity
Prediction Challenge dataset show that, even with a small number of support
(audio, score) pairs, our method outperforms audiogram-based predictions. Our
work presents a new paradigm for personalized speech intelligibility
prediction.

TL;DR: 研究比较了三种预训练音频嵌入（OpenL3、VGGish和Wav2Vec2.0）在帕金森病（PD）分类中的表现，发现OpenL3在特定任务中表现最佳，而Wav2Vec2.0存在性别偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音障碍是帕金森病的重要生物标志物，但现有研究未充分探讨个体差异对深度学习特征的影响。

Method: 使用NeuroVoz数据集，评估三种预训练音频嵌入在DDK和LR任务中的表现。

Result: OpenL3在DDK和LR任务中表现最优，Wav2Vec2.0在DDK任务中显示出性别偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非典型语音模式对分类的挑战，需改进特征提取和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Speech impairments are prevalent biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease (PD),
motivating the development of diagnostic techniques using speech data for
clinical applications. Although deep acoustic features have shown promise for
PD classification, their effectiveness often varies due to individual speaker
differences, a factor that has not been thoroughly explored in the existing
literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of three pre-trained
audio embeddings (OpenL3, VGGish and Wav2Vec2.0 models) for PD classification.
Using the NeuroVoz dataset, OpenL3 outperforms others in diadochokinesis (DDK)
and listen and repeat (LR) tasks, capturing critical acoustic features for PD
detection. Only Wav2Vec2.0 shows significant gender bias, achieving more
favorable results for male speakers, in DDK tasks. The misclassified cases
reveal challenges with atypical speech patterns, highlighting the need for
improved feature extraction and model robustness in PD detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于音素聚类和常见学习者错误的替代感知对齐无关GOP方法，提升了CAPT系统的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GOP依赖强制对齐，易受声学变异性导致的标注和分割错误影响，而对齐无关方法计算成本高且扩展性差。

Method: 引入替代感知对齐无关GOP，通过限制音素替代（基于音素聚类和常见错误）提升效率。

Result: 在MPC和SpeechOcean762数据集上测试，限制音素替代（RPS）优于无限制（UPS）和基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了GOP性能，未来可进一步优化音素聚类和错误模式。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems employ automatic
measures of pronunciation quality, such as the goodness of pronunciation (GOP)
metric. GOP relies on forced alignments, which are prone to labeling and
segmentation errors due to acoustic variability. While alignment-free methods
address these challenges, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly
with phoneme sequence length and inventory size. To enhance efficiency, we
introduce a substitution-aware alignment-free GOP that restricts phoneme
substitutions based on phoneme clusters and common learner errors. We evaluated
our GOP on two L2 English speech datasets, one with child speech, My
Pronunciation Coach (MPC), and SpeechOcean762, which includes child and adult
speech. We compared RPS (restricted phoneme substitutions) and UPS
(unrestricted phoneme substitutions) setups within alignment-free methods,
which outperformed the baseline. We discuss our results and outline avenues for
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管印地语是全球第四大语言，拥有超过6亿使用者，但针对印度语言的发音训练工具仍然匮乏。

Method: 系统结合了印地语语音生成、错误发音分析和个性化反馈方法，利用其高度语音化的书写系统进行核心分析。

Result: Dhvani系统能够针对学习者的发音错误提供精准反馈。

Conclusion: 该研究为印地语发音训练提供了创新解决方案，并有望扩展到其他印度语言。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) has been extensively studied
for English. However, there remains a critical gap in its application to Indian
languages with a base of 1.5 billion speakers. Pronunciation tools tailored to
Indian languages are strikingly lacking despite the fact that millions learn
them every year. With over 600 million speakers and being the fourth
most-spoken language worldwide, improving Hindi pronunciation is a vital first
step toward addressing this gap. This paper proposes 1) Dhvani -- a novel CAPT
system for Hindi, 2) synthetic speech generation for Hindi mispronunciations,
and 3) a novel methodology for providing personalized feedback to learners.
While the system often interacts with learners using Devanagari graphemes, its
core analysis targets phonemic distinctions, leveraging Hindi's highly phonetic
orthography to analyze mispronounced speech and provide targeted feedback.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的Prompt-Unseen-Emotion (PUE)方法，通过情感引导的提示学习生成未见过的情感语音，解决了现有TTS系统只能处理有限情感类别的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统仅能建模有限的情感类别，而人类对话的情感远超出这些预定义范围，因此需要探索更自然的情感语音生成方法。

Method: 采用LLM-TTS架构训练PUE，通过情感相关提示学习确保情感一致性，并量化每句话的情感权重。推理时通过调整情感比例和利用LLM上下文知识生成混合情感语音。

Result: PUE在零样本设置下成功生成了未见过的情感语音，实现了多样化的情感表达。

Conclusion: PUE方法为情感语音合成提供了更灵活和自然的解决方案，扩展了TTS系统的情感表达能力。

Abstract: Existing expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems primarily model a limited
set of categorical emotions, whereas human conversations extend far beyond
these predefined emotions, making it essential to explore more diverse
emotional speech generation for more natural interactions. To bridge this gap,
this paper proposes a novel prompt-unseen-emotion (PUE) approach to generate
unseen emotional speech via emotion-guided prompt learning. PUE is trained
utilizing an LLM-TTS architecture to ensure emotional consistency between
categorical emotion-relevant prompts and emotional speech, allowing the model
to quantitatively capture different emotion weightings per utterance. During
inference, mixed emotional speech can be generated by flexibly adjusting
emotion proportions and leveraging LLM contextual knowledge, enabling the model
to quantify different emotional styles. Our proposed PUE successfully
facilitates expressive speech synthesis of unseen emotions in a zero-shot
setting.

Result: 实验结果显示高保真和高可懂度的语音合成，CapSpeech是目前最大的CapTTS相关任务数据集。

Conclusion: CapSpeech为CapTTS系统开发提供了宝贵见解，并填补了数据集和研究空白。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly
transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS).
However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to
the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on
downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce
CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks,
including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events
(CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS
(EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech
comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36
million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new
datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced
audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside
the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive
and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate
high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range
of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest
available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks.
The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the
challenges of developing CapTTS systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种滑动窗口扩散框架，用于实时语音增强，解决了传统扩散模型计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在语音增强中表现优异但计算成本高，无法满足实时流数据处理需求。

Method: 采用滑动窗口扩散框架，随时间逐步污染语音信号，对当前帧分配更多噪声，并通过缓冲区大小平衡性能与延迟。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于标准扩散模型，GPU上运行时输入输出延迟为0.3至1秒。

Conclusion: 这是首个实用的基于扩散模型的在线语音增强解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have been recently
used for speech enhancement with remarkable success but are computationally
expensive at inference time. Therefore, these models are impractical for
processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window
diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively
corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to
the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay
proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between
performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving
an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first
practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.

Method: 使用合成和高维数据，评估扭力对扰动的敏感性，并在多种自编码器架构中评估其可恢复性。

Result: 研究发现基于域的方法存在关键局限性，扭力信息在编码和解码过程中容易丢失或改变。

Conclusion: 需要设计能够保留扭力信息的架构或损失项，以实现更稳健的数据表示。

Abstract: We explore the role of torsion in hybrid deep learning models that
incorporate topological data analysis, focusing on autoencoders. While most TDA
tools use field coefficients, this conceals torsional features present in
integer homology. We show that torsion can be lost during encoding, altered in
the latent space, and in many cases, not reconstructed by standard decoders.
Using both synthetic and high-dimensional data, we evaluate torsion sensitivity
to perturbations and assess its recoverability across several autoencoder
architectures. Our findings reveal key limitations of field-based approaches
and underline the need for architectures or loss terms that preserve torsional
information for robust data representation.

Abstract: Enabling robots to accurately interpret and execute spoken language
instructions is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Traditional
methods rely on speech recognition to transcribe speech into text, often
discarding crucial prosodic cues needed for disambiguating intent. We propose a
novel approach that directly leverages speech prosody to infer and resolve
instruction intent. Predicted intents are integrated into large language models
via in-context learning to disambiguate and select appropriate task plans.
Additionally, we present the first ambiguous speech dataset for robotics,
designed to advance research in speech disambiguation. Our method achieves

Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which
aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies.
Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to
synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring
paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a
stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge
formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp
spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To
guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that
encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability.
Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates
stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work
enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges
vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

Abstract: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the
environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use
feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and
hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles.
High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational
requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this
area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel
transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental
results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$
score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale
real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between
urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at

Result: 在运动预测和模仿学习等任务中，RodriNet表现显著优于传统架构。

Conclusion: 将运动学先验整合到网络架构中，能有效提升动作学习的效果。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting articulated actions is important in robot
learning. However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack
inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated
systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable
generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to
inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on
this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural
architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity
of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction,
showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation
learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image
3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured
kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in
various domains.

Abstract: Symbiosis of Agents is a large-scale installation by Baoyang Chen that embeds
AI-driven robots in an immersive, mirror-lined arena, probing the tension
between machine agency and artistic authorship. Drawing on early cybernetics,
rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid
exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the
public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive
tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This
hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues
and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding
drama.Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical
exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in
AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive
lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools,
forging a living, emergent artwork. Exhibited internationally, Symbiosis of
Agents shows how cybernetic feedback, robotic experimentation, and conceptual
rule-making can converge to redefine agency, authorship, and ethics in
contemporary art.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于嗅觉惯性里程计（OIO）的框架，用于机器人通过气味导航，类似于视觉惯性里程计（VIO）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器嗅觉导航是一个复杂且难以模拟的任务，需要一种新的方法来解决。

Method: 结合惯性运动学和快速采样嗅觉传感器，借鉴SLAM和VIO的原理，提出OIO框架，并在5自由度机器人手臂上进行实验。

Result: 成功建立了OIO的基准框架，验证了其在农业和食品质量控制等实际应用中的可行性。

Conclusion: OIO为嗅觉导航研究提供了基础框架，未来可通过性能优化应对更复杂的任务。

Abstract: Olfactory navigation is one of the most primitive mechanisms of exploration
used by organisms. Navigation by machine olfaction (artificial smell) is a very
difficult task to both simulate and solve. With this work, we define olfactory
inertial odometry (OIO), a framework for using inertial kinematics, and
fast-sampling olfaction sensors to enable navigation by scent analogous to
visual inertial odometry (VIO). We establish how principles from SLAM and VIO
can be extrapolated to olfaction to enable real-world robotic tasks. We
demonstrate OIO with three different odour localization algorithms on a real
5-DoF robot arm over an odour-tracking scenario that resembles real
applications in agriculture and food quality control. Our results indicate
success in establishing a baseline framework for OIO from which other research
in olfactory navigation can build, and we note performance enhancements that
can be made to address more complex tasks in the future.

Motivation: 解决RMFS中货架重新定位问题（PRP）的优化需求，传统方法在动态性和复杂性上表现不足。

Method: 结合ALNS和DRL，动态选择破坏和修复操作符，并调整关键参数（如破坏程度和接受阈值），同时设计针对PRP特性的启发式规则。

Result: DRL引导的ALNS在解质量和效率上优于传统方法（如最便宜位置、固定位置、二进制整数规划和静态启发式）。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了学习驱动控制在组合优化中的优势，为仓库系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Pod Repositioning Problem (PRP) in Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems
(RMFS) involves selecting optimal storage locations for pods returning from
pick stations. This work presents an improved solution method that integrates
Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) with Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL). A DRL agent dynamically selects destroy and repair operators and adjusts
key parameters such as destruction degree and acceptance thresholds during the
search. Specialized heuristics for both operators are designed to reflect
PRP-specific characteristics, including pod usage frequency and movement costs.
Computational results show that this DRL-guided ALNS outperforms traditional
approaches such as cheapest-place, fixed-place, binary integer programming, and
static heuristics. The method demonstrates strong solution quality and
illustrating the benefit of learning-driven control within combinatorial
optimization for warehouse systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于1v1四旋翼无人机追逃任务，通过异步多阶段种群算法解决对抗性训练中的非平稳性和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型无人机在民用和军用领域的普及，未经授权或恶意无人机进入限制区域引发了安全和安保问题，需要高效追逃策略。

Method: 采用强化学习框架训练神经网络策略，控制四旋翼无人机的体速率和集体推力，并引入异步多阶段种群算法（AMSPB）进行对抗性训练。

Result: 速率控制策略显著提高了捕获率和峰值速度，AMSPB算法在对抗基准测试中表现出稳定且单调的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机追逃任务提供了高效解决方案，AMSPB算法有效解决了对抗训练中的挑战。

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of small UAVs in civilian and military airspace
has raised critical safety and security concerns, especially when unauthorized
or malicious drones enter restricted zones. In this work, we present a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile 1v1 quadrotor pursuit-evasion.
We train neural network policies to command body rates and collective thrust,
enabling high-speed pursuit and evasive maneuvers that fully exploit the
quadrotor's nonlinear dynamics. To mitigate nonstationarity and catastrophic
forgetting during adversarial co-training, we introduce an Asynchronous
Multi-Stage Population-Based (AMSPB) algorithm where, at each stage, either the
pursuer or evader learns against a sampled opponent drawn from a growing
population of past and current policies. This continual learning setup ensures
monotonic performance improvement and retention of earlier strategies. Our
results show that (i) rate-based policies achieve significantly higher capture
rates and peak speeds than velocity-level baselines, and (ii) AMSPB yields
stable, monotonic gains against a suite of benchmark opponents.

TL;DR: Tru-POMDP是一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）和POMDP规划的任务规划方法，用于处理家庭服务机器人中的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭服务机器人面临模糊指令、未知物体位置和开放词汇类型等问题，导致规划空间巨大且不确定性高。

Method: 提出Tru-POMDP，利用LLM生成结构化信念，并通过层次化假设树（TOH）和POMDP模型进行高效规划。

Result: 在复杂厨房环境的重排任务中，Tru-POMDP优于现有LLM和混合规划方法，成功率和效率更高。

Conclusion: Tru-POMDP通过结合LLM和POMDP，显著提升了机器人任务规划的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Task planning under uncertainty is essential for home-service robots
operating in the real world. Tasks involve ambiguous human instructions, hidden
or unknown object locations, and open-vocabulary object types, leading to
significant open-ended uncertainty and a boundlessly large planning space. To
address these challenges, we propose Tru-POMDP, a planner that combines
structured belief generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) with principled
POMDP planning. Tru-POMDP introduces a hierarchical Tree of Hypotheses (TOH),
which systematically queries an LLM to construct high-quality particle beliefs
over possible world states and human goals. We further formulate an open-ended
POMDP model that enables rigorous Bayesian belief tracking and efficient
belief-space planning over these LLM-generated hypotheses. Experiments on
complex object rearrangement tasks across diverse kitchen environments show
that Tru-POMDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and
LLM-tree-search hybrid planners, achieving higher success rates with
significantly better plans, stronger robustness to ambiguity and occlusion, and
greater planning efficiency.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在处理多种约束（如碰撞避免和动态一致性）时存在局限性，通常分开或部分考虑。

Method: 提出UniConFlow框架，结合流匹配和二次规划，引入规定时间归零函数增强灵活性，实现约束感知生成。

Result: 在移动导航和高维操作任务中，UniConFlow表现出比现有约束生成规划器更高的安全性和可行性。

Conclusion: UniConFlow通过统一框架和约束感知生成，显著提升了机器人轨迹生成的性能。

Abstract: Generative models have become increasingly powerful tools for robot motion
generation, enabling flexible and multimodal trajectory generation across
various tasks. Yet, most existing approaches remain limited in handling
multiple types of constraints, such as collision avoidance and dynamic
consistency, which are often treated separately or only partially considered.
This paper proposes UniConFlow, a unified flow matching (FM) based framework
for trajectory generation that systematically incorporates both equality and
inequality constraints. UniConFlow introduces a novel prescribed-time zeroing
function to enhance flexibility during the inference process, allowing the
model to adapt to varying task requirements. To ensure constraint satisfaction,
particularly with respect to obstacle avoidance, admissible action range, and
kinodynamic consistency, the guidance inputs to the FM model are derived
through a quadratic programming formulation, which enables constraint-aware
generation without requiring retraining or auxiliary controllers. We conduct
mobile navigation and high-dimensional manipulation tasks, demonstrating
improved safety and feasibility compared to state-of-the-art constrained
generative planners. Project page is available at https://uniconflow.github.io.

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习代理在适应性上的不足，模仿哺乳动物的空间导航能力。

Method: 整合网格细胞编码器和PPO策略，利用视觉和运动传感器数据生成空间表示。

Result: 在简单和复杂场景中分别达到99%和>94%的成功率，导航更高效可靠。

Conclusion: EDEN为机器人空间智能提供了生物基础，结合了神经导航原理与强化学习。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents are often fragile while humans remain
adaptive and flexible to varying scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present
EDEN, a biologically inspired navigation framework that integrates learned
entorhinal-like grid cell representations and reinforcement learning to enable
autonomous navigation. Inspired by the mammalian entorhinal-hippocampal system,
EDEN allows agents to perform path integration and vector-based navigation
using visual and motion sensor data. At the core of EDEN is a grid cell encoder
that transforms egocentric motion into periodic spatial codes, producing
low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings of position. To generate these
activations from raw sensory input, we combine fiducial marker detections in
the lightweight MiniWorld simulator and DINO-based visual features in the
high-fidelity Gazebo simulator. These spatial representations serve as input to
a policy trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), enabling dynamic,
goal-directed navigation. We evaluate EDEN in both MiniWorld, for rapid
prototyping, and Gazebo, which offers realistic physics and perception noise.
Compared to baseline agents using raw state inputs (e.g., position, velocity)
or standard convolutional image encoders, EDEN achieves a 99% success rate,
within the simple scenarios, and >94% within complex floorplans with occluded
paths with more efficient and reliable step-wise navigation. In addition, as a
replacement of ground truth activations, we present a trainable Grid Cell
encoder enabling the development of periodic grid-like patterns from vision and
motion sensor data, emulating the development of such patterns within
biological mammals. This work represents a step toward biologically grounded
spatial intelligence in robotics, bridging neural navigation principles with
reinforcement learning for scalable deployment.

Abstract: Web applications are critical to modern software ecosystems, yet ensuring
their reliability remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature
of web interfaces. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling
dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an
automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web
application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the
system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and
generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle
conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions
include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site
navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating
form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating
form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
effectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of
web application testing.

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates the applicability of the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide framework to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

complex data, iterative experimentation, and specialized expertise while
navigating significant ethical considerations. Our analysis identifies gaps in
the PMBOK Guide, including its limited focus on data management, insufficient
support for iterative development, and lack of guidance on ethical and
multidisciplinary challenges. To address these deficiencies, we recommend
integrating data lifecycle management, adopting iterative and AI project

Method: 研究使用RoBERTa、GPT-2、LLaMA和StarCoder等模型，涵盖代码翻译、生成和摘要任务，并设计四种污染场景进行实验。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了污染必然导致性能高估的传统观点，为代码智能模型的评估和部署提供了新见解。

Abstract: In recent years, code intelligence has gained increasing importance in the
field of automated software engineering. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of
Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised
concerns regarding data contamination and its potential impact on model
performance evaluation. This paper presents a systematic empirical study to
investigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our
study involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs,
namely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code
generation, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into
four types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only,
output-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct
corresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.
  Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and
inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired
contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But
direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects.
In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly
affected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination
scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the
conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance
overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of
code intelligence models.

Motivation: 现有开源预训练模型（PTMs）资源缺乏针对软件工程（SE）需求的分类，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统收集HF API中的PTMs数据，结合模型描述、元数据和arXiv论文摘要，经过多步过滤（如异常检测、去重和使用Gemini 2.0 Flash验证）识别出2,205个SE相关PTMs。

Result: 代码生成是SE PTMs中最常见的任务，而需求工程和软件设计任务较少；文本生成在SE PTMs中占主导地位，且自2023年第二季度以来SE PTMs数量显著增加。

Conclusion: 该分类法为未来自动化SE场景（如PTMs的采样和选择）提供了基础。

Abstract: Open-Source Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) provide extensive resources for various
Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yet these resources lack a classification tailored
to Software Engineering (SE) needs. To address this gap, we derive a taxonomy
encompassing 147 SE tasks and apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs in a
popular open-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF). Our repository mining
study began with a systematically gathered database of PTMs from the HF API,
considering their model card descriptions and metadata, and the abstract of the
associated arXiv papers. We confirmed SE relevance through multiple filtering
steps: detecting outliers, identifying near-identical PTMs, and the use of
Gemini 2.0 Flash, which was validated with five pilot studies involving three
human annotators. This approach uncovered 2,205 SE PTMs. We find that code
generation is the most common SE task among PTMs, primarily focusing on
software implementation, while requirements engineering and software design
activities receive limited attention. In terms of ML tasks, text generation
dominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly
since 2023 Q2. Our classification provides a solid foundation for future
automated SE scenarios, such as the sampling and selection of suitable PTMs.

Result: 在标准MARL基准测试（如SMAC II地图）中，该方法优于现有最优基线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过选择性探索和混合学习策略，显著提升了MARL的效率和性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved
state-of-the-art results on a range of multi-agent tasks. Yet, MARL algorithms
typically require significantly more environment interactions than their
single-agent counterparts to converge, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty
in exploring over a large joint action space and the high variance intrinsic to
MARL environments. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel algorithm that
combines a decomposed centralized critic with decentralized ensemble learning,
incorporating several key contributions. The main component in our scheme is a
selective exploration method that leverages ensemble kurtosis. We extend the
global decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual
critics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward
high-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the
centralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\lambda$)
algorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the
actor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL,
mixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This
approach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely
off-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of
SMAC II maps.

Result: 该方法在保持通用性的同时，提高了优化效率和框架的可维护性。

Conclusion: 随机密钥遗传算法及其变体（如偏置随机密钥遗传算法）是有效的优化工具。

Abstract: A random-key genetic algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic for discrete
and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as a vector of N random keys,
where a random key is a real number randomly generated in the continuous
interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each vector of random keys to a solution of the
optimization problem being solved and computes its cost. The benefit of this
approach is that all genetic operators and transformations can be maintained
within the unitary hypercube, regardless of the problem being addressed. This
enhances the productivity and maintainability of the core framework. The
algorithm starts with a population of P vectors of random keys. At each
iteration, the vectors are partitioned into two sets: a smaller set of
high-valued elite solutions and the remaining non-elite solutions. All elite
elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of
random-key vectors (the mutants) is added to the population of the next
iteration. The remaining elements of the population of the next iteration are
generated by combining, with the parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and
DeJong (1991), pairs of solutions. This chapter reviews random-key genetic
algorithms and describes an effective variant called biased random-key genetic
algorithms.

Abstract: Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the
ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics
have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents.
Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit
complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of
other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially
expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese
participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and
Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering
alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering,
i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age
and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories,
especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent
identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work
on voice agents.

Motivation: 探索音乐表演中表达性和即兴性对情感传递和听众反应的作用。

Method: 专业音乐家完成多种任务，表演者和听众提供情感标注，结合音频分析和神经生理学测量。

Result: 即兴表演具有独特的声学特征和更强的情绪反应，神经生理学数据显示更放松。

Conclusion: 表达性对增强情感沟通和听众参与具有重要作用。

Abstract: This study investigates emotional expression and perception in music
performance using computational and neurophysiological methods. The influence
of different performance settings, such as repertoire, diatonic modal etudes,
and improvisation, as well as levels of expressiveness, on performers'
emotional communication and listeners' reactions is explored. Professional
musicians performed various tasks, and emotional annotations were provided by
both performers and the audience. Audio analysis revealed that expressive and
improvisational performances exhibited unique acoustic features, while emotion
analysis showed stronger emotional responses. Neurophysiological measurements
indicated greater relaxation in improvisational performances. This multimodal
study highlights the significance of expressivity in enhancing emotional
communication and audience engagement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术在交互系统中的广泛应用，系统的整体架构仍不透明，需要一种方法使系统更易理解。

Method: 将交互系统表示为结构构建块（如AI模型和控制机制）的序列，并通过可视化构建块（如XAI技术）解释。

Result: 提出了一种基于流的架构和原型系统，为人类和自动化代理（如LLMs）提供了明确的系统概述。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化和可视化构建块，实现了交互系统的透明化，提升了人类和机器对AI模型的可解释性。

Abstract: While the increased integration of AI technologies into interactive systems
enables them to solve an equally increasing number of tasks, the black box
problem of AI models continues to spread throughout the interactive system as a
whole. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can make AI models more accessible by
employing post-hoc methods or transitioning to inherently interpretable models.
While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system
architecture remains opaque. To this end, we propose an approach to represent
interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks, such as AI
models and control mechanisms grounded in the literature. These can then be
explained through accompanying visual building blocks, such as XAI techniques.
The flow and APIs of the structural building blocks form an explicit overview
of the system. This serves as a communication basis for both humans and
automated agents like LLMs, aligning human and machine interpretability of AI
models. We discuss a selection of building blocks and concretize our flow-based
approach in an architecture and accompanying prototype interactive system.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“无数据算法”的方法，用于在没有标注参考数据的情况下评估标注器的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有标注参考数据的情况下，无法通过测试或假设来验证标注器的可信度，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出“无数据算法”，通过向标注器提出一系列挑战来验证其可信度。

Result: 算法能够高概率地验证可信标注器，并识别不可信的标注器。

Conclusion: “无数据算法”是一种有效的方法，可在无参考数据的情况下验证标注器的可信度。

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure
its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are
either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to
label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are
unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data,
and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an
algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator
without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing
challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish
trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows
the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and,
conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it.
We present formal proofs of correctness and limited experiments.

Result: 在真实大学数据上验证，优于人工分配，更好地满足学生偏好。

Conclusion: 研究为教育场景团队形成提供了新方法，并启发未来研究。

Abstract: Teamwork is integral to higher education, fostering students' interpersonal
skills, improving learning outcomes, and preparing them for professional
collaboration later in their careers. While team formation has traditionally
been managed by humans, either instructors or students, algorithmic approaches
have recently emerged to optimize this process. However, existing algorithmic
team formation methods often focus on expert teams, overlook agency in choosing
one's teammates, and are limited to a single team formation setting. These
limitations make them less suitable for education, where no student can be left
out, student agency is crucial for motivation, and team formation needs vary
across courses and programs. In this paper, we introduce the EDUCATIONAL TEAM
FORMATION problem (EDU-TF), a partitioning optimization problem model tailored
to the unique needs of education, integrating both teacher and student
requirements. To solve EDU-TF, we propose a modular optimization approach, one
of the first to allow the flexible adjustment of objectives according to
educational needs, enhancing the method's applicability across various
classroom settings rather than just research environments. Results from
evaluating ten strategies derived from our model on real-world university
datasets indicate that our approach outperforms heuristic teacher-assigned
teams by better accommodating student preferences. Our study contributes a new
modular approach to partition-based algorithmic team formation and provides
valuable insights for future research on team formation in educational
settings.

Motivation: 多语言场景下，说话人嵌入中的语言信息与说话人信息相互纠缠，导致识别准确率下降。

Method: 采用基于前缀调优的交叉注意力联合学习方法，有效分离语言和说话人信息。

Result: 模型在单语和多语场景（包括未见语言）中均表现优异，显著降低了等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功分离了语言和说话人信息，提升了多语言条件下的说话人识别性能。

Abstract: Speaker recognition models face challenges in multi-lingual settings due to
the entanglement of linguistic information within speaker embeddings. The
overlap between vocal traits such as accent, vocal anatomy, and a language's
phonetic structure complicates separating linguistic and speaker information.
Disentangling these components can significantly improve speaker recognition
accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel disentanglement learning strategy
that integrates joint learning through prefix-tuned cross-attention. This
approach is particularly effective when speakers switch between languages.
Experimental results show the model generalizes across monolingual and
multi-lingual settings, including unseen languages. Notably, the proposed model
improves the equal error rate across multiple datasets, highlighting its
ability to separate language information from speaker embeddings and enhance
recognition in diverse linguistic conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习语音合成技术的发展导致假音频问题日益严重，现有防御模型未能建模决策的可信度。

Method: 通过神经网络生成证据，利用Dirichlet分布建模不确定性，结合预测概率和不确定性估计形成最终决策。

Result: 在ASVspoof系列数据集上验证了模型在准确性、鲁棒性和可信度方面的优异性能。

Conclusion: 基于Dirichlet分布的方法显著提升了假音频检测的可靠性。

Abstract: With the continuous development of deep learning-based speech conversion and
speech synthesis technologies, the cybersecurity problem posed by fake audio
has become increasingly serious. Previously proposed models for defending
against fake audio have attained remarkable performance. However, they all fall
short in modeling the trustworthiness of the decisions made by the models
themselves. Based on this, we put forward a plausible fake audio detection
approach based on the Dirichlet distribution with the aim of enhancing the
reliability of fake audio detection. Specifically, we first generate evidence
through a neural network. Uncertainty is then modeled using the Dirichlet
distribution. By modeling the belief distribution with the parameters of the
Dirichlet distribution, an estimate of uncertainty can be obtained for each
decision. Finally, the predicted probabilities and corresponding uncertainty
estimates are combined to form the final opinion. On the ASVspoof series
dataset (i.e., ASVspoof 2019 LA, ASVspoof 2021 LA, and DF), we conduct a number
of comparison experiments to verify the excellent performance of the proposed
model in terms of accuracy, robustness, and trustworthiness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SALF-MOS的新模型，用于预测语音合成的MOS分数，解决了现有客观指标不可靠和主观评估耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有客观指标（如PESQ、POLQA、STOI）无法有效选择最佳语音合成模型，而主观评估（如MOS）虽可靠但耗时费力。

Method: 开发了SALF-MOS模型，通过卷积序列提取音频样本的潜在特征，实现端到端的MOS预测。

Result: 模型在MSE、LCC、SRCC和KTAU等指标上取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: SALF-MOS是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于语音质量评估。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment is a critical process in selecting text-to-speech
synthesis (TTS) or voice conversion models. Evaluation of voice synthesis can
be done using objective metrics or subjective metrics. Although there are many
objective metrics like the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ),
Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Assessment (POLQA) or Short-Time
Objective Intelligibility (STOI) but none of them is feasible in selecting the
best model. On the other hand subjective metric like Mean Opinion Score is
highly reliable but it requires a lot of manual efforts and are time-consuming.
To counter the issues in MOS Evaluation, we have developed a novel model,
Speaker Agnostic Latent Features (SALF)-Mean Opinion Score (MOS) which is a
small-sized, end-to-end, highly generalized and scalable model for predicting
MOS score on a scale of 5. We use the sequences of convolutions and stack them
to get the latent features of the audio samples to get the best
state-of-the-art results based on mean squared error (MSE), Linear Concordance
Correlation coefficient (LCC), Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) and
Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient (KTAU).

Conclusion: 提出的系统在音频源追踪任务中表现出色，尤其在区分真实与伪造语音模式方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Audio deepfakes are acquiring an unprecedented level of realism with advanced
AI. While current research focuses on discerning real speech from spoofed
speech, tracing the source system is equally crucial. This work proposes a
novel audio source tracing system combining deep metric multi-class N-pair loss
with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion framework, a Conformer classification
network, and ensemble score-embedding fusion. The N-pair loss improves
discriminative ability, while Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion enhance
robustness by focusing on differentiating real and fake speech patterns. The
Conformer network captures both global and local dependencies in the audio
signal, crucial for source tracing. The proposed ensemble score-embedding
fusion shows an optimal trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain source
tracing scenarios. We evaluate our method using Frechet Distance and standard
metrics, demonstrating superior performance in source tracing over the baseline
system.

Conclusion: OCDGALP方法在说话人分割任务中表现出色，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: In speaker diarization, traditional clustering-based methods remain widely
used in real-world applications. However, these methods struggle with the
complex distribution of speaker embeddings and overlapping speech segments. To
address these limitations, we propose an Overlapping Community Detection method
based on Graph Attention networks and the Label Propagation Algorithm
(OCDGALP). The proposed framework comprises two key components: (1) a graph
attention network that refines speaker embeddings and node connections by
aggregating information from neighboring nodes, and (2) a label propagation
algorithm that assigns multiple community labels to each node, enabling
simultaneous clustering and overlapping community detection. Experimental
results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the Diarization
Error Rate (DER), achieving a state-of-the-art 15.94% DER on the DIHARD-III
dataset without oracle Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and an impressive 11.07%
with oracle VAD.

Conclusion: 该工作通过结合检索和扩散模型，为音乐驱动的舞蹈生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Generating long-term, coherent, and realistic music-conditioned dance
sequences remains a challenging task in human motion synthesis. Existing
approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed
template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while
capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical
alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a
hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance
generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three
core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that
aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space,
establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An
optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless
concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence
across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly
conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion
quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality,
diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a
new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based
template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.

Abstract: Language-queried Audio Source Separation (LASS) enables open-vocabulary sound
separation via natural language queries. While existing methods rely on
task-specific training, we explore whether pretrained diffusion models,
originally designed for audio generation, can inherently perform separation
without further training. In this study, we introduce a training-free framework
leveraging generative priors for zero-shot LASS. Analyzing na\"ive adaptations,
we identify key limitations arising from modality-specific challenges.To
address these issues, we propose Diffusion-Guided Mask Optimization (DGMO), a
test-time optimization framework that refines spectrogram masks for precise,
input-aligned separation. Our approach effectively repurposes pretrained
diffusion models for source separation, achieving competitive performance
without task-specific supervision. This work expands the application of
diffusion models beyond generation, establishing a new paradigm for zero-shot
audio separation. The code is available at: https://wltschmrz.github.io/DGMO/

accumulation through asymmetric knowledge distillation from a bidirectional
teacher model into a sparse causal, autoregressive student model; (3) We design
a high-throughput, low-latency inference pipeline incorporating several key
