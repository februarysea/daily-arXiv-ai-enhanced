### [1] [Exploring Moral Exercises for Human Oversight of AI systems: Insights from Three Pilot Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15851)
*Silvia Crafa,Teresa Scantamburlo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过道德练习帮助AI从业者培养美德以实现有效人类监督AI系统的方法，并基于三个试点研究验证其潜力与局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何通过道德练习培养AI从业者的美德，以提升对AI系统的人类监督能力。

Method: 提出了道德练习的概念框架，包括激发个人参与、培养关系理解和培育技术道德智慧，并通过三个试点研究验证其效果。

Result: 试点研究表明道德练习有助于在组织内培养负责任的AI文化，但也揭示了其局限性。

Conclusion: 论文结论指出道德练习在促进AI伦理文化方面具有潜力，并建议未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper elaborates on the concept of moral exercises as a means to help AI
actors cultivate virtues that enable effective human oversight of AI systems.
We explore the conceptual framework and significance of moral exercises,
situating them within the contexts of philosophical discourse, ancient
practices, and contemporary AI ethics scholarship. We outline the core pillars
of the moral exercises methodology - eliciting an engaged personal disposition,
fostering relational understanding, and cultivating technomoral wisdom - and
emphasize their relevance to key activities and competencies essential for
human oversight of AI systems. Our argument is supported by findings from three
pilot studies involving a company, a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers,
and higher education students. These studies allow us to explore both the
potential and the limitations of moral exercises. Based on the collected data,
we offer insights into how moral exercises can foster a responsible AI culture
within organizations, and suggest directions for future research.

### [2] [Multimodal AI-based visualization of strategic leaders' emotional dynamics: a deep behavioral analysis of Trump's trade war discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16274)
*Wei Meng*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨政治领袖在战略决策中的情感与行为机制，以特朗普对华关税为例，采用多模态认知行为建模框架，发现其决策非理性驱动，而是基于支配-一致性节奏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解政治领袖在战略决策中的情感与行为机制，以特朗普对华关税政策为案例。

Method: 采用多模态认知行为建模框架，包括微表情追踪、语调分析、语义流建模、认知负荷模拟和战略行为映射。

Result: 特朗普的决策并非理性推导，而是由支配-一致性节奏驱动。

Conclusion: 提出六轴国家战略节奏干预框架，支持前瞻性政策建模。

Abstract: This study investigates the emotional rhythms and behavioral mechanisms of
dominant political leaders in strategic decision-making. Using the Trump
administration's 125 percent tariff hike on China as a case, it adopts a
Multimodal Cognitive Behavioral Modeling framework. This includes
micro-expression tracking, acoustic intonation analysis, semantic flow
modeling, cognitive load simulation, and strategic behavior mapping to
construct a full-cycle simulation of emotion, motivation, and output. Results
reveal that Trump's decisions are not driven by rational deduction, but emerge
from dominance-coherence rhythms. A six-axis National Strategic Tempo
Intervention Framework is proposed to support anticipatory policy modeling.

### [3] [TAPAS: A Pattern-Based Approach to Assessing Government Transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16413)
*Jos Zuijderwijk,Iris Beerepoot,Thomas Martens,Eva Knies,Tanja van der Lippe,Hajo A. Reijers*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAPAS的数据驱动方法，用于评估政府透明度，通过识别阻碍透明度的行为模式，并在荷兰政府部门进行了实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府透明度的评估方法通常未能考虑公务员的实际工作行为且资源密集，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，开发了TAPAS系统，通过分析电子文档管理系统的数据识别透明度障碍。

Result: 在荷兰政府部门的应用中，识别出八种透明度障碍，分为四类，并证明TAPAS能够持续监控并提供可行建议。

Conclusion: TAPAS是一种资源高效且实用的工具，能够有效评估和改进政府透明度。

Abstract: Government transparency, widely recognized as a cornerstone of open
government, depends on robust information management practices. Yet effective
assessment of information management remains challenging, as existing methods
fail to consider the actual working behavior of civil servants and are
resource-intensive. Using a design science research approach, we present the
Transparency Anti-Pattern Assessment System (TAPAS) -- a novel, data-driven
methodology designed to evaluate government transparency through the
identification of behavioral patterns that impede transparency. We demonstrate
TAPAS's real-world applicability at a Dutch ministry, analyzing their
electronic document management system data from the past two decades. We
identify eight transparency anti-patterns grouped into four categories:
Incomplete Documentation, Limited Accessibility, Unclear Information, and
Delayed Documentation. We show that TAPAS enables continuous monitoring and
provides actionable insights without requiring significant resource
investments.

### [4] [NY Real Estate Racial Equity Analysis via Applied Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16946)
*Sanjana Chalavadi,Andrei Pastor,Terry Leitch*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现纽约州和纽约市房地产所有权存在显著的种族不平等，白人持有过多财产价值，而少数族裔在财产所有权中占比不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示房地产所有权中的种族不平等现象，为政策制定提供数据支持。

Method: 使用LSTM+Geo与XGBoost过滤的种族/族裔预测模型，比较预测的财产所有者种族构成与人口普查数据。

Result: 白人持有财产比例过高，少数族裔社区在财产所有权中代表性不足，尤其是在少数族裔占多数的社区。

Conclusion: 研究强调了房地产所有权中的种族不平等，并指出数据驱动方法对解决这些问题的重要性。

Abstract: This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York
State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an
advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering,
validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of
property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a
Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how
incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity
estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a
disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their
population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented
as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority
neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly
non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates
these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority
communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for
majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with
extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and
rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property
ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and
highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues.

### [5] [MM-MovieDubber: Towards Multi-Modal Learning for Multi-Modal Movie Dubbing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16279)
*Junjie Zheng,Zihao Chen,Chaofan Ding,Yunming Liang,Yihan Fan,Huan Yang,Lei Xie,Xinhan Di*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态生成框架，用于解决电影配音中的风格适应、对话处理和细节考虑等问题，实验结果显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电影配音技术虽能实现语音与视频的同步和情感表达，但在配音风格、对话处理及细节（如年龄和性别）方面仍有不足。

Method: 采用多模态大视觉语言模型（VLM）分析视觉输入以识别配音类型和细节，并利用大型语音生成模型生成高质量配音。同时构建了一个带标注的电影配音数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准数据集上优于现有技术，LSE-D、SPK-SIM、EMO-SIM和MCD指标分别提升了1.09%、8.80%、19.08%和18.74%。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态框架显著提升了电影配音的质量和适应性，尤其在风格和细节处理方面表现突出。

Abstract: Current movie dubbing technology can produce the desired speech using a
reference voice and input video, maintaining perfect synchronization with the
visuals while effectively conveying the intended emotions. However, crucial
aspects of movie dubbing, including adaptation to various dubbing styles,
effective handling of dialogue, narration, and monologues, as well as
consideration of subtle details such as speaker age and gender, remain
insufficiently explored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal
generative framework. First, it utilizes a multi-modal large vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze visual inputs, enabling the recognition of dubbing types
and fine-grained attributes. Second, it produces high-quality dubbing using
large speech generation models, guided by multi-modal inputs. Additionally, a
movie dubbing dataset with annotations for dubbing types and subtle details is
constructed to enhance movie understanding and improve dubbing quality for the
proposed multi-modal framework. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
In details, the LSE-D, SPK-SIM, EMO-SIM, and MCD exhibit improvements of up to
1.09%, 8.80%, 19.08%, and 18.74%, respectively.

### [6] [Is Your LLM-Based Multi-Agent a Reliable Real-World Planner? Exploring Fraud Detection in Travel Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16557)
*Junchi Yao,Jianhua Xu,Tianyu Xin,Ziyi Wang,Shenzhe Zhu,Shu Yang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了WandaPlan评估环境，用于测试多智能体规划系统在欺诈内容下的表现，并揭示了现有框架的弱点，同时提出了集成反欺诈代理的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多智能体规划系统依赖易受欺诈信息影响的平台（如评论网站和社交媒体），可能导致经济损失和用户体验下降，因此需要评估其风险。

Method: 引入WandaPlan评估环境，模拟真实数据并注入欺诈内容，测试系统在三种欺诈案例中的表现。

Result: 发现现有框架过于注重任务效率而忽视数据真实性，验证了WandaPlan的通用性。

Conclusion: 提出集成反欺诈代理的方案，以降低欺诈风险，确保可靠的规划。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Planning has leveraged
advanced frameworks to enable autonomous and collaborative task execution. Some
systems rely on platforms like review sites and social media, which are prone
to fraudulent information, such as fake reviews or misleading descriptions.
This reliance poses risks, potentially causing financial losses and harming
user experiences. To evaluate the risk of planning systems in real-world
applications, we introduce \textbf{WandaPlan}, an evaluation environment
mirroring real-world data and injected with deceptive content. We assess system
performance across three fraud cases: Misinformation Fraud, Team-Coordinated
Multi-Person Fraud, and Level-Escalating Multi-Round Fraud. We reveal
significant weaknesses in existing frameworks that prioritize task efficiency
over data authenticity. At the same time, we validate WandaPlan's
generalizability, capable of assessing the risks of real-world open-source
planning frameworks. To mitigate the risk of fraud, we propose integrating an
anti-fraud agent, providing a solution for reliable planning.

### [7] [Ricci Matrix Comparison for Graph Alignment: A DMC Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15831)
*Ashley Wang,Peter Chin*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于几何的图对齐方法Ricci Matrix Comparison (RMC)，并验证了其在复杂网络中对齐的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索节点对应及其最优性，通过几何方法改进图对齐问题。

Method: 基于度矩阵比较(DMC)提出RMC，利用Ricci曲率改进对齐方法。

Result: 实验表明RMC在复杂网络中能达到80-90%以上的对齐准确率。

Conclusion: RMC为图对齐领域提供了新视角，并部分验证了DMC方法的有效性。

Abstract: The graph alignment problem explores the concept of node correspondence and
its optimality. In this paper, we focus on purely geometric graph alignment
methods, namely our newly proposed Ricci Matrix Comparison (RMC) and its
original form, Degree Matrix Comparison (DMC). To formulate a
Ricci-curvature-based graph alignment situation, we start with discussing
different ideas of constructing one of the most typical and important
topological objects, the torus, and then move on to introducing the RMC based
on DMC with theoretical motivations. Lastly, we will present to the reader
experimental results on a torus and a complex protein-protein interaction
network that indicate the potential of applying a differential-geometric view
to graph alignment. Results show that a direct variation of DMC using Ricci
curvature can help with identifying holes in tori and aligning line graphs of a
complex network at 80-90+% accuracy. This paper contributes a new perspective
to the field of graph alignment and partially shows the validity of the
previous DMC method.

### [8] [Web2Wiki: Characterizing Wikipedia Linking Across the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15837)
*Veniamin Veselovsky,Tiziano Piccardi,Ashton Anderson,Robert West,Akhil Arora*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模分析了维基百科在互联网上的引用情况，发现其主要用于新闻和科学网站的信息参考，且多数链接出现在主要内容中，作为背景知识提供。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索维基百科在其平台之外的引用情况及其在互联网中的角色。

Method: 使用Common Crawl数据集，分析了超过9000万条维基百科链接，涵盖1.68%的网站域名，研究了其分布、上下文和功能。

Result: 1. 新闻和科学网站最常引用维基百科；2. 链接多出现在主要内容中；3. 95%的链接用于解释而非证据或引用。

Conclusion: 维基百科在互联网中主要作为背景知识提供者，其数据集支持未来对其全球影响力的研究。

Abstract: Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites globally, yet its role beyond
its own platform remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the
first large-scale analysis of how Wikipedia is referenced across the Web. Using
a dataset from Common Crawl, we identify over 90 million Wikipedia links
spanning 1.68% of Web domains and examine their distribution, context, and
function. Our analysis of English Wikipedia reveals three key findings: (1)
Wikipedia is most frequently cited by news and science websites for
informational purposes, while commercial websites reference it less often. (2)
The majority of Wikipedia links appear within the main content rather than in
boilerplate or user-generated sections, highlighting their role in structured
knowledge presentation. (3) Most links (95%) serve as explanatory references
rather than as evidence or attribution, reinforcing Wikipedia's function as a
background knowledge provider. While this study focuses on English Wikipedia,
our publicly released Web2Wiki dataset includes links from multiple language
editions, supporting future research on Wikipedia's global influence on the
Web.

### [9] [MPPFND: A Dataset and Analysis of Detecting Fake News with Multi-Platform Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15834)
*Congyuan Zhao,Lingwei Wei,Ziming Qin,Wei Zhou,Yunya Song,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨平台假新闻检测模型（APSL），通过图神经网络提取多平台社交上下文特征，实验表明考虑平台间传播差异能提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测算法通常基于单一平台，忽略了不同平台传播特性的差异，导致检测效果受限。

Method: 引入MPPFND数据集捕捉多平台传播结构，提出APSL模型利用图神经网络提取多平台社交上下文特征。

Result: 实验证明，考虑跨平台传播差异能显著提升假新闻检测性能。

Conclusion: 跨平台传播特性的差异对假新闻检测至关重要，APSL模型在多平台环境下表现优越。

Abstract: Fake news spreads widely on social media, leading to numerous negative
effects. Most existing detection algorithms focus on analyzing news content and
social context to detect fake news. However, these approaches typically detect
fake news based on specific platforms, ignoring differences in propagation
characteristics across platforms. In this paper, we introduce the MPPFND
dataset, which captures propagation structures across multiple platforms. We
also describe the commenting and propagation characteristics of different
platforms to show that their social contexts have distinct features. We propose
a multi-platform fake news detection model (APSL) that uses graph neural
networks to extract social context features from various platforms. Experiments
show that accounting for cross-platform propagation differences improves fake
news detection performance.

### [10] [AH-UGC: Adaptive and Heterogeneous-Universal Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15842)
*Mohit Kataria,Shreyash Bhilwade,Sandeep Kumar,Jayadeva*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LSH和一致性哈希的自适应图粗化框架，支持异构图的语义一致性，显著提升了效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图粗化方法每次只能生成一个粗化图，且对不同粗化比例需重新计算，效率低下；同时，多数方法仅适用于同构图，无法处理异构图的语义约束。

Method: 结合局部敏感哈希（LSH）和一致性哈希实现自适应图粗化；针对异构图提出类型隔离粗化策略，确保语义一致性。

Result: 在23个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持图结构和语义完整性的同时，具有卓越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次统一支持自适应和异构粗化，为大规模图学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: $\textbf{Graph Coarsening (GC)}$ is a prominent graph reduction technique
that compresses large graphs to enable efficient learning and inference.
However, existing GC methods generate only one coarsened graph per run and must
recompute from scratch for each new coarsening ratio, resulting in unnecessary
overhead. Moreover, most prior approaches are tailored to
$\textit{homogeneous}$ graphs and fail to accommodate the semantic constraints
of $\textit{heterogeneous}$ graphs, which comprise multiple node and edge
types. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
combines Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with Consistent Hashing to enable
$\textit{adaptive graph coarsening}$. Leveraging hashing techniques, our method
is inherently fast and scalable. For heterogeneous graphs, we propose a
$\textit{type isolated coarsening}$ strategy that ensures semantic consistency
by restricting merges to nodes of the same type. Our approach is the first
unified framework to support both adaptive and heterogeneous coarsening.
Extensive evaluations on 23 real-world datasets including homophilic,
heterophilic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method
achieves superior scalability while preserving the structural and semantic
integrity of the original graph.

*Yujia Zhou,Hexi Wang,Qingyao Ai,Zhen Wu,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: ProSim是一个模拟框架，用于研究LLM代理在不同社会条件下亲社会行为的动态变化。通过三个研究，发现代理能稳定表现亲社会行为，但也受政策不平等影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在社交环境中广泛应用，理解其亲社会行为的能力变得至关重要。

Method: ProSim框架包括个体、场景、交互和干预模拟，通过三个渐进研究评估亲社会行为。

Result: LLM代理能稳定表现亲社会行为，但政策不平等会抑制其行为并通过社交网络传播。

Conclusion: 研究为评估代理驱动社会的社会对齐和制度动态奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as autonomous agents in
social contexts, understanding their capacity for prosocial behavior becomes
essential. We present ProSim, a simulation framework designed to examine how
prosocial behavior emerges, adapts, and erodes in LLM-based agents under
diverse social and institutional conditions. The framework comprises four
components: individual simulation, scenario simulation, interaction simulation,
and intervention simulation. We conduct three progressive studies to evaluate
prosocial alignment. First, we show that LLM agents can demonstrate stable and
context-sensitive prosocial behavior across diverse scenarios and adapt their
responses under normative policy interventions. Second, we find that agents
engage in fairness-based third-party punishment and respond systematically to
variations in inequity magnitude and enforcement cost. Third, we show that
policy-induced inequities suppress prosocial behavior, propagate through social
networks, and are mediated by agents' perceptions of unfairness. These findings
lay the groundwork for evaluating social alignment and modeling institutional
dynamics in agent-driven societies.

### [12] [Tight Practical Bounds for Subgraph Densities in Ego-centric Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16079)
*Connor Mattes,Esha Datta,Ali Pinar*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的子图扩散比方法，用于量化网络中子图密度的差异，并结合标志代数、模体计数和拓扑数据分析技术，显著提高了子图密度边界的紧密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究子图密度在网络分析中的重要性，尤其是在区分数学决定和领域驱动的子图密度特征时面临的挑战。

Method: 结合标志代数、模体计数和拓扑数据分析技术，提出子图扩散比，并提供了更紧的子图密度边界。

Result: 通过实证分析11个真实网络，发现社交网络的子图扩散比显著低于其他类型网络（如维基百科链接网络）。

Conclusion: 子图扩散比能够量化网络结构的直观理解，并为比较不同类型网络提供了有效指标。

Abstract: Subgraph densities play a crucial role in network analysis, especially for
the identification and interpretation of meaningful substructures in complex
graphs. Localized subgraph densities, in particular, can provide valuable
insights into graph structures. Distinguishing between
mathematically-determined and domain-driven subgraph density features, however,
poses challenges. For instance, the lack or presence of certain structures can
be explained by graph density or degree distribution. These differences are
especially meaningful in applied contexts as they allow us to identify
instances where the data induces specific network structures, such as
friendships in social networks. The goal of this paper is to measure these
differences across various types of graphs, conducting social media analysis
from a network perspective. To this end, we first provide tighter bounds on
subgraph densities. We then introduce the subgraph spread ratio to quantify the
realized subgraph densities of specific networks relative to the feasible
bounds. Our novel approach combines techniques from flag algebras,
motif-counting, and topological data analysis. Crucially, effective adoption of
the state-of-the-art in the plain flag algebra method yields feasible regions
up to three times tighter than prior best-known results, thereby enabling more
accurate and direct comparisons across graphs. We additionally perform an
empirical analysis of 11 real-world networks. We observe that social networks
consistently have smaller subgraph spread ratios than other types of networks,
such as linkage-mapping networks for Wikipedia pages. This aligns with our
intuition about social relationships: such networks have meaningful structure
that makes them distinct. The subgraph spread ratio enables the quantification
of intuitive understandings of network structures and provides a metric for
comparing types of networks.

### [13] [Novel Rewiring Mechanism for Restoration of the Fragmented Social Networks after Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16233)
*Rajesh Kumar,Suchi Kumari,Anubhav Mishra*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了复杂网络的鲁棒性恢复方法，通过重连或添加边来重建网络，并采用拉普拉斯能量评估恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的复杂网络（如社交网络、技术基础设施）易因随机故障或外部攻击而断开连接，因此研究如何提升其安全性和恢复能力至关重要。

Method: 采用两种方法：(i) 战略性重连，(ii) 预算约束下的最优重连，并通过拉普拉斯能量评估网络鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现，仅依赖最大连通分量评估鲁棒性不全面，拉普拉斯能量能更全面地反映网络恢复后的行为。

Conclusion: 拉普拉斯能量是一种更有效的网络鲁棒性评估指标，尤其在网络恢复过程中。

Abstract: Real-world complex systems exhibit intricate interconnections and
dependencies, especially social networks, technological infrastructures, and
communication networks. These networks are prone to disconnection due to random
failures or external attacks on their components. Therefore, managing the
security and resilience of such networks is a prime concern, particularly at
the time of disaster. Therefore, in this research work, network is
reconstructed by rewiring/addition of the edges and robustness of the networks
is measured. To this aim, two approaches namely (i) Strategic rewiring (ii)
budget constrained optimal rewiring are adopted. While current research often
assesses robustness by examining the size of the largest connected component,
this approach fails to capture the complete spectrum of vulnerability. The
failure of a small number of connections leads to a sparser network yet
connected network. Thus, the present research work delves deeper into
evaluating the robustness of the restored network by evaluating Laplacian
Energy to better comprehend the system's behavior during the restoration of the
network still considering the size of the largest connected component attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata作为协作知识图谱，存在数据不完整和系统性缺口的问题，需要系统研究以理解这些缺口的现状。

Method: 通过系统文献综述，提出缺口的分类和理论框架，并分析现有文献中的方法和指标。

Result: 研究揭示了Wikidata中的缺口类型，并提出了测量框架，同时识别了被忽视的缺口。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解Wikidata的质量、完整性及系统性偏见的影响，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Wikidata is a collaborative knowledge graph which provides machine-readable
structured data for Wikimedia projects including Wikipedia. Managed by a
community of volunteers, it has grown to become the most edited Wikimedia
project. However, it features a long-tail of items with limited data and a
number of systematic gaps within the available content. In this paper, we
present the results of a systematic literature review aimed to understand the
state of these content gaps within Wikidata. We propose a typology of gaps
based on prior research and contribute a theoretical framework intended to
conceptualise gaps and support their measurement. We also describe the methods
and metrics present used within the literature and classify them according to
our framework to identify overlooked gaps that might occur in Wikidata. We then
discuss the implications for collaboration and editor activity within Wikidata
as well as future research directions. Our results contribute to the
understanding of quality, completeness and the impact of systematic biases
within Wikidata and knowledge gaps more generally.

Method: 通过多臂老虎机模型动态选择候选边，扩展候选集以提升搜索灵活性。

Result: 在多个TSP基准测试中表现优异，并显著提升了LKH-3在TSP变体中的性能。

Conclusion: 动态候选边选择策略有效提升了算法性能，适用于TSP及其变体。

Abstract: Algorithms designed for routing problems typically rely on high-quality
candidate edges to guide their search, aiming to reduce the search space and
enhance the search efficiency. However, many existing algorithms, like the
classical Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP), often use predetermined candidate edges that remain static
throughout local searches. This rigidity could cause the algorithm to get
trapped in local optima, limiting its potential to find better solutions. To
address this issue, we propose expanding the candidate sets to include other
promising edges, providing them an opportunity for selection. Specifically, we
incorporate multi-armed bandit models to dynamically select the most suitable
candidate edges in each iteration, enabling LKH to make smarter choices and
lead to improved solutions. Extensive experiments on multiple TSP benchmarks
show the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, we employ this
bandit-based method to LKH-3, an extension of LKH tailored for solving various
TSP variant problems, and our method also significantly enhances LKH-3's
performance across typical TSP variants.

TL;DR: PhyX是一个新的大规模基准测试，旨在评估模型在视觉场景中的物理推理能力，发现当前最先进模型在此任务上表现显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能涵盖物理推理这一关键智能方面，因此需要新的评估工具。

Method: PhyX包含3K多模态问题，覆盖6种推理类型和6个核心物理领域，通过多种评估范式分析模型表现。

Result: GPT-4o、Claude3.7-Sonnet和GPT-o4-mini的准确率仅为32.5%、42.2%和45.8%，远低于人类专家。

Conclusion: 当前模型在物理推理上存在严重局限性，需改进对真实物理理解的能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks fail to capture a crucial aspect of intelligence:
physical reasoning, the integrated ability to combine domain knowledge,
symbolic reasoning, and understanding of real-world constraints. To address
this gap, we introduce PhyX: the first large-scale benchmark designed to assess
models capacity for physics-grounded reasoning in visual scenarios. PhyX
includes 3K meticulously curated multimodal questions spanning 6 reasoning
types across 25 sub-domains and 6 core physics domains: thermodynamics,
electromagnetism, mechanics, modern physics, optics, and wave\&acoustics. In
our comprehensive evaluation, even state-of-the-art models struggle
significantly with physical reasoning. GPT-4o, Claude3.7-Sonnet, and
GPT-o4-mini achieve only 32.5\%, 42.2\%, and 45.8\% accuracy
respectively-performance gaps exceeding 29\% compared to human experts. Our
analysis exposes critical limitations in current models: over-reliance on
memorized disciplinary knowledge, excessive dependence on mathematical
formulations, and surface-level visual pattern matching rather than genuine
physical understanding. We provide in-depth analysis through fine-grained
statistics, detailed case studies, and multiple evaluation paradigms to
thoroughly examine physical reasoning capabilities. To ensure reproducibility,
we implement a compatible evaluation protocol based on widely-used toolkits
such as VLMEvalKit, enabling one-click evaluation.

Abstract: We present a method for the automated discovery of system-level dynamics in
Flow-Lenia$-$a continuous cellular automaton (CA) with mass conservation and
parameter localization$-$using a curiosity-driven AI scientist. This method
aims to uncover processes leading to self-organization of evolutionary and
ecosystemic dynamics in CAs. We build on previous work which uses diversity
search algorithms in Lenia to find self-organized individual patterns, and
extend it to large environments that support distinct interacting patterns. We
adapt Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) to drive
exploration of diverse Flow-Lenia environments using simulation-wide metrics,
such as evolutionary activity, compression-based complexity, and multi-scale
entropy. We test our method in two experiments, showcasing its ability to
illuminate significantly more diverse dynamics compared to random search. We
show qualitative results illustrating how ecosystemic simulations enable
self-organization of complex collective behaviors not captured by previous
individual pattern search and analysis. We complement automated discovery with
an interactive exploration tool, creating an effective human-AI collaborative
workflow for scientific investigation. Though demonstrated specifically with
Flow-Lenia, this methodology provides a framework potentially applicable to
other parameterizable complex systems where understanding emergent collective
properties is of interest.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种异构LLM驱动的多智能体系统（X-MAS），通过结合不同LLM的能力提升系统性能，并开发了X-MAS-Bench测试平台进行验证。实验表明异构配置显著优于同构配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体系统（MAS）限制了系统的智能水平，因此探索异构LLM驱动的MAS以突破这一限制。

Method: 提出X-MAS框架，并设计X-MAS-Bench测试平台，评估27种LLM在5个领域和5种功能上的表现，进行了170万次评估。

Result: 异构LLM驱动的MAS在性能上显著优于同构配置，例如在MATH数据集上提升8.4%，在AIME数据集上提升47%。

Conclusion: 异构LLM驱动的MAS具有变革性潜力，为可扩展的协作AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) extend the capabilities of single LLMs by
enabling cooperation among multiple specialized agents. However, most existing
MAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the
system's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the
paradigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by
diverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence
of diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to
evaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and
MAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs
across 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over
1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each
domain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that
transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can
significantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign.
Specifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration
yields up to 8.4\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed
chatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable
47\% performance boost on the AIME dataset. Our results underscore the
transformative potential of heterogeneous LLMs in MAS, highlighting a promising
avenue for advancing scalable, collaborative AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI推理能力的发展（如大型推理模型LRMs的出现），了解儿童如何理解AI的推理过程对培养AI素养至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：与8名儿童共同设计会话，随后对106名儿童（3-8年级）进行实地研究。

Result: 发现儿童对AI推理的三种模型：演绎、归纳和固有模型。低年级儿童（3-5年级）倾向于认为AI推理源于固有智能，而高年级儿童（6-8年级）更倾向于认为AI是模式识别器。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了儿童对AI推理理解的三种矛盾，并提出了对AI课程设计和可解释AI工具开发的启示。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances in reasoning capabilities, most
recently with the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), understanding how
children conceptualize AI's reasoning processes becomes critical for fostering
AI literacy. While one of the "Five Big Ideas" in AI education highlights
reasoning algorithms as central to AI decision-making, less is known about
children's mental models in this area. Through a two-phase approach, consisting
of a co-design session with 8 children followed by a field study with 106
children (grades 3-8), we identified three models of AI reasoning: Deductive,
Inductive, and Inherent. Our findings reveal that younger children (grades 3-5)
often attribute AI's reasoning to inherent intelligence, while older children
(grades 6-8) recognize AI as a pattern recognizer. We highlight three tensions
that surfaced in children's understanding of AI reasoning and conclude with
implications for scaffolding AI curricula and designing explainable AI tools.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖全反馈数据且易产生误差累积，而观测数据更实际且成本低。

Method: 提出因果端到端框架，引入两种理论支持的替代目标（分类上界和softmax加权遗憾近似），并扩展处理异构成本偏好。

Result: 在公开基准测试中表现优于现有基线，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过观测数据高效学习路由策略，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query,
balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool
of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy,
where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on
these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on
full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models,
which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from
observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually
deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies
by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable
efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate
objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret
approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further
extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an
interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that
our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across different embedding models.

Result: 数据集成功挑战了模型在无仿真工具或显式物理模型的情况下，理解力流和材料分布的能力。

Conclusion: 该数据集为评估模型的物理和空间推理能力提供了新的视角，补充了传统基准的不足。

Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology
optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a
design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are
provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and
must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset
includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within
partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these
tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material
distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or
explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural
stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of
spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a
complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究实现了从‘数据驱动拟合’到‘基于角色的模拟与机制解释’的范式转变，为紧急情况下的恐慌情绪预测提供了透明且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: During sudden disaster events, accurately predicting public panic sentiment
on social media is crucial for proactive governance and crisis management.
Current efforts on this problem face three main challenges: lack of finely
annotated data hinders emotion prediction studies, unmodeled risk perception
causes prediction inaccuracies, and insufficient interpretability of panic
formation mechanisms. We address these issues by proposing a Psychology-driven
generative Agent framework (PsychoAgent) for explainable panic prediction based
on emotion arousal theory. Specifically, we first construct a fine-grained open
panic emotion dataset (namely COPE) via human-large language models (LLMs)
collaboration to mitigate semantic bias. Then, we develop a framework
integrating cross-domain heterogeneous data grounded in psychological
mechanisms to model risk perception and cognitive differences in emotion
generation. To enhance interpretability, we design an LLM-based role-playing
agent that simulates individual psychological chains through dedicatedly
designed prompts. Experimental results on our annotated dataset show that
PsychoAgent improves panic emotion prediction performance by 12.6% to 21.7%
compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the explainability and generalization
of our approach is validated. Crucially, this represents a paradigm shift from
opaque "data-driven fitting" to transparent "role-based simulation with
mechanistic interpretation" for panic emotion prediction during emergencies.

Conclusion: 内存管理策略对LLM代理的长期性能至关重要，研究结果为设计稳健的内存系统提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents,
enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance
over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory
management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term
performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that
are widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new
experiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past
experiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through
our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an
experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the
input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent
outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated
with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences
compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay,
where outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks.
Through controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and
deletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an
average absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth.
Furthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior
under challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained
memory resources. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of
LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory
components that support robust, long-term agent performance. We also release
our code to facilitate further study.

Result: 实验显示SynEVO在跨领域场景下泛化能力提升最多42%。

Conclusion: SynEVO为知识迁移和适应提供了NeuroAI范式。

Abstract: Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various
scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train
an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited
transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design
and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable
collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by
neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information
boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a
Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the
model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and
aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the
human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic
common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and
task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic
coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group
should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under
various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization
capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a
paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.

optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language
feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation
dimensions. We propose a two-step agent prompts optimization pipeline:
identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing
textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents
utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various
optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online
against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For
group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass
prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software
development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we
investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of
the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

Abstract: As of 2025, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has become a central
tool for productivity across industries. Beyond text generation, GenAI now
plays a critical role in coding, data analysis, and research workflows. As
large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is essential to assess the
reliability and accuracy of their outputs, especially in specialized,
high-stakes domains like finance. Most modern LLMs transform text into
numerical vectors, which are used in operations such as cosine similarity
searches to generate responses. However, this abstraction process can lead to
misinterpretation of emotional tone, particularly in nuanced financial
contexts. While LLMs generally excel at identifying sentiment in everyday
language, these models often struggle with the nuanced, strategically ambiguous
language found in earnings call transcripts. Financial disclosures frequently
embed sentiment in hedged statements, forward-looking language, and
industry-specific jargon, making it difficult even for human analysts to
interpret consistently, let alone AI models. This paper presents findings from
the Santa Clara Microsoft Practicum Project, led by Professor Charlie
Goldenberg, which benchmarks the performance of Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's
ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and traditional machine learning models for sentiment
analysis of financial text. Using Microsoft earnings call transcripts, the
analysis assesses how well LLM-derived sentiment correlates with market
sentiment and stock movements and evaluates the accuracy of model outputs.
Prompt engineering techniques are also examined to improve sentiment analysis
results. Visualizations of sentiment consistency are developed to evaluate
alignment between tone and stock performance, with sentiment trends analyzed
across Microsoft's lines of business to determine which segments exert the
greatest influence.

Abstract: Developing artificial intelligence (AI) for vertical domains requires a solid
data foundation for both training and evaluation. In this work, we introduce
TrialPanorama, a large-scale, structured database comprising 1,657,476 clinical
trial records aggregated from 15 global sources. The database captures key
aspects of trial design and execution, including trial setups, interventions,
conditions, biomarkers, and outcomes, and links them to standard biomedical
ontologies such as DrugBank and MedDRA. This structured and ontology-grounded
design enables TrialPanorama to serve as a unified, extensible resource for a
wide range of clinical trial tasks, including trial planning, design, and
summarization. To demonstrate its utility, we derive a suite of benchmark tasks
directly from the TrialPanorama database. The benchmark spans eight tasks
across two categories: three for systematic review (study search, study
screening, and evidence summarization) and five for trial design (arm design,
eligibility criteria, endpoint selection, sample size estimation, and trial
completion assessment). The experiments using five state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) show that while general-purpose LLMs exhibit some
zero-shot capability, their performance is still inadequate for high-stakes
clinical trial workflows. We release TrialPanorama database and the benchmark

Abstract: Validating scientific hypotheses is a central challenge in biomedical
research, and remains difficult for artificial intelligence (AI) agents due to
the complexity of real-world data analysis and evidence interpretation. In this
work, we present BioDSA-1K, a benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on
realistic, data-driven biomedical hypothesis validation tasks. BioDSA-1K
consists of 1,029 hypothesis-centric tasks paired with 1,177 analysis plans,
curated from over 300 published biomedical studies to reflect the structure and
reasoning found in authentic research workflows. Each task includes a
structured hypothesis derived from the original study's conclusions, expressed
in the affirmative to reflect the language of scientific reporting, and one or
more pieces of supporting evidence grounded in empirical data tables. While
these hypotheses mirror published claims, they remain testable using standard
statistical or machine learning methods. The benchmark enables evaluation along
four axes: (1) hypothesis decision accuracy, (2) alignment between evidence and
conclusion, (3) correctness of the reasoning process, and (4) executability of
the AI-generated analysis code. Importantly, BioDSA-1K includes non-verifiable
hypotheses: cases where the available data are insufficient to support or
refute a claim, reflecting a common yet underexplored scenario in real-world
science. We propose BioDSA-1K as a foundation for building and evaluating
generalizable, trustworthy AI agents for biomedical discovery.

Conclusion: Logot框架成功结合LLMs的自然语言理解与逻辑编程的精确推理能力。

Abstract: Solving puzzles in natural language poses a long-standing challenge in AI.
While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities
in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that
demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search. In this paper, we propose
Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic
programming to address this problem. Our method leverages LLMs to translate
puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which
are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter. This hybrid
approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise
reasoning capabilities of logic programs. We evaluate our method on various
grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating near-perfect
accuracy across all tasks. Our code and data are available at:

Result: LLM代理系统在多领域展现出灵活性，但仍需解决延迟、安全等问题。

Conclusion: LLM代理系统具有广阔前景，但需进一步优化以应对技术挑战。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped agent systems.
Unlike traditional rule-based agents with limited task scope, LLM-powered
agents offer greater flexibility, cross-domain reasoning, and natural language
interaction. Moreover, with the integration of multi-modal LLMs, current agent
systems are highly capable of processing diverse data modalities, including
text, images, audio, and structured tabular data, enabling richer and more
adaptive real-world behavior. This paper comprehensively examines the evolution
of agent systems from the pre-LLM era to current LLM-powered architectures. We
categorize agent systems into software-based, physical, and adaptive hybrid
systems, highlighting applications across customer service, software
development, manufacturing automation, personalized education, financial
trading, and healthcare. We further discuss the primary challenges posed by
LLM-powered agents, including high inference latency, output uncertainty, lack
of evaluation metrics, and security vulnerabilities, and propose potential
solutions to mitigate these concerns.

TL;DR: Sudoku-Bench是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估大型语言模型在创造性、多步逻辑推理上的能力，通过挑战性的数独变体避免记忆依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能捕捉真实的创造力，常依赖记忆模式，因此需要一种能评估创造性推理的新方法。

Method: 使用精心挑选的数独变体，设计标准化文本表示和工具，确保评估清晰一致。

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在无辅助情况下解决不到15%的谜题，显示其在长时战略推理上的不足。

Conclusion: Sudoku-Bench为研究长期战略推理提供了有效工具，并揭示了LLMs在此领域的改进空间。

Abstract: Existing reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) frequently
fail to capture authentic creativity, often rewarding memorization of
previously observed patterns. We address this shortcoming with Sudoku-Bench, a
curated benchmark of challenging and unconventional Sudoku variants
specifically selected to evaluate creative, multi-step logical reasoning.
Sudoku variants form an unusually effective domain for reasoning research: each
puzzle introduces unique or subtly interacting constraints, making memorization
infeasible and requiring solvers to identify novel logical breakthroughs
(``break-ins''). Despite their diversity, Sudoku variants maintain a common and
compact structure, enabling clear and consistent evaluation. Sudoku-Bench
includes a carefully chosen puzzle set, a standardized text-based puzzle
representation, and flexible tools compatible with thousands of publicly
available puzzles -- making it easy to extend into a general research
environment. Baseline experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs solve fewer
than 15\% of puzzles unaided, highlighting significant opportunities to advance
long-horizon, strategic reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Unlearning Shapley的新框架，通过机器学习遗忘技术高效估算数据价值，解决了传统方法计算成本高或依赖完整数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型的普及增加了对高效数据估值方法的需求，传统方法（如基于博弈论的Shapley值）计算成本高或依赖完整数据，难以实现部分数据估值。

Method: 利用机器学习遗忘技术，通过从预训练模型中遗忘目标数据并测量性能变化来计算Shapley值，避免了重新训练和对完整数据的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在基准数据集和大规模文本语料库上与传统方法精度相当，同时显著降低了计算开销。

Conclusion: Unlearning Shapley为现代AI生态系统提供了一种可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，填补了数据估值理论与实际应用之间的空白。

Abstract: The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data
valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers.
Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and
influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or
require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly
achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley,
a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values
efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring
performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values
via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on
full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data
valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for
data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora
demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods
while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis
confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of
data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work
bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment,
offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAI-DPO是一种动态数据选择算法，通过实时评估模型在不同训练阶段的能力，优化数据选择，显著提升推理任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖静态指标，无法适应动态训练过程，限制了模型能力的持续提升。

Method: SAI-DPO通过实时反馈模型性能，动态调整数据选择，以适应模型在不同训练阶段的能力变化。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，SAI-DPO平均性能提升21.3个百分点，尤其在AIME24和AMC23上表现突出。

Conclusion: 动态、模型自适应的数据选择策略优于静态方法，显著提升了推理任务的性能。

Abstract: In the realm of data selection for reasoning tasks, existing approaches
predominantly rely on externally predefined static metrics such as difficulty
and diversity, which are often designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
lack adaptability to continuous training processes. A critical limitation of
these methods is their inability to dynamically align with the evolving
capabilities of models during online training, a gap that becomes increasingly
pronounced with the rise of dynamic training paradigms and online reinforcement
learning (RL) frameworks (e.g., R1 models). To address this, we introduce
SAI-DPO, an algorithm that dynamically selects training data by continuously
assessing a model's stage-specific reasoning abilities across different
training phases. By integrating real-time model performance feedback, SAI-DPO
adaptively adapts data selection to the evolving strengths and weaknesses of
the model, thus enhancing both data utilization efficiency and final task
performance. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art models and eight
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including challenging competition-level
datasets (e.g., AIME24 and AMC23), demonstrate that SAI-DPO achieves an average
performance boost of up to 21.3 percentage points, with particularly notable
improvements of 10 and 15 points on AIME24 and AMC23, respectively. These
results highlight the superiority of dynamic, model-adaptive data selection
over static, externally defined strategies in advancing reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现优异，但面临有害查询和对抗攻击的安全风险。现有监督微调（SFT）方法在泛化未见过越狱提示时表现不佳。

Method: 提出SafeKey方法，包括双路径安全头（增强关键句子前的安全信号）和查询掩码建模目标（提升模型对查询理解的注意力）。

Result: 实验表明，SafeKey显著提升安全性，平均有害率降低9.6%，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SafeKey通过重塑内部注意力和改进隐藏表示质量，有效提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce a new generation paradigm of
explicitly reasoning before answering, leading to remarkable improvements in
complex tasks. However, they pose great safety risks against harmful queries
and adversarial attacks. While recent mainstream safety efforts on LRMs,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), improve safety performance, we find that
SFT-aligned models struggle to generalize to unseen jailbreak prompts. After
thorough investigation of LRMs' generation, we identify a safety aha moment
that can activate safety reasoning and lead to a safe response. This aha moment
typically appears in the `key sentence', which follows models' query
understanding process and can indicate whether the model will proceed safely.
Based on these insights, we propose SafeKey, including two complementary
objectives to better activate the safety aha moment in the key sentence: (1) a
Dual-Path Safety Head to enhance the safety signal in the model's internal
representations before the key sentence, and (2) a Query-Mask Modeling
objective to improve the models' attention on its query understanding, which
has important safety hints. Experiments across multiple safety benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods significantly improve safety generalization to a
wide range of jailbreak attacks and out-of-distribution harmful prompts,
lowering the average harmfulness rate by 9.6\%, while maintaining general
abilities. Our analysis reveals how SafeKey enhances safety by reshaping
internal attention and improving the quality of hidden representations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经网络的方法，利用事件位置数据补全多智能体系统中的速度信息，以提升团队运动的动态分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件位置数据缺乏连续时间信息，限制了动态分析的深度，尤其是速度和交互行为的理解。

Method: 提出神经网络方法，利用事件位置数据补全所有智能体的速度信息，并考虑时间依赖性和图结构。

Result: 实验表明，神经网络方法在速度补全误差上优于基于规则的方法，且空间评估结果更接近完整跟踪数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升团队运动系统分析的深度和准确性。

Abstract: In many real-world complex systems, the behavior can be observed as a
collection of discrete events generated by multiple interacting agents.
Analyzing the dynamics of these multi-agent systems, especially team sports,
often relies on understanding the movement and interactions of individual
agents. However, while providing valuable snapshots, event-based positional
data typically lacks the continuous temporal information needed to directly
calculate crucial properties such as velocity. This absence severely limits the
depth of dynamic analysis, preventing a comprehensive understanding of
individual agent behaviors and emergent team strategies. To address this
challenge, we propose a new method to simultaneously complete the velocity of
all agents using only the event-based positional data from team sports. Based
on this completed velocity information, we investigate the applicability of
existing team sports analysis and evaluation methods. Experiments using soccer
event data demonstrate that neural network-based approaches outperformed
rule-based methods regarding velocity completion error, considering the
underlying temporal dependencies and graph structure of player-to-player or
player-to-ball interaction. Moreover, the space evaluation results obtained
using the completed velocity are closer to those derived from complete tracking
data, highlighting our method's potential for enhanced team sports system
analysis.

Result: 实验表明，LightRouter性能优于基线模型，准确率提升25%，推理成本降低27%。

Conclusion: LightRouter为高效LLM选择提供了实用方法，并为模型组合策略提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has unlocked remarkable
capabilities across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks.
However, the considerable differences among available LLMs-in terms of cost,
performance, and computational demands-pose significant challenges for users
aiming to identify the most suitable model for specific tasks. In this work, we
present LightRouter, a novel framework designed to systematically select and
integrate a small subset of LLMs from a larger pool, with the objective of
jointly optimizing both task performance and cost efficiency. LightRouter
leverages an adaptive selection mechanism to identify models that require only
a minimal number of boot tokens, thereby reducing costs, and further employs an
effective integration strategy to combine their outputs. Extensive experiments
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LightRouter matches or outperforms
widely-used ensemble baselines, achieving up to a 25% improvement in accuracy.
Compared with leading high-performing models, LightRouter achieves comparable
performance while reducing inference costs by up to 27%. Importantly, our
framework operates without any prior knowledge of individual models and relies
exclusively on inexpensive, lightweight models. This work introduces a
practical approach for efficient LLM selection and provides valuable insights
into optimal strategies for model combination.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在异常检测中存在的'超球崩溃'问题，并提升模型对不同架构的兼容性。

Method: 通过Base Embedder捕获高维时间动态，结合Cluster Distance Mapping和Sequence-wise Clustering实现连续中心更新，并使用'One-directed Adaptive loss'优化聚类。

Result: 在四个时间序列基准数据集上的实验表明，MADCluster显著提升了对比模型的性能。

Conclusion: MADCluster的兼容性使其有望在不同架构中提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly
detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is
applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the
'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly
detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a
'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping
data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective
single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The
optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of
three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal
dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous
center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying
various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series
benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall
performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of
MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在上下文学习中因缺乏标记数据而性能受限的问题。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，通过识别有影响力的未标记样本并进行伪标记，自适应地选择和调整这些样本作为输入。

Result: 实验表明，MAPLE能显著提升LLM在有限标记数据下的性能和适应性。

Conclusion: MAPLE是一种高效且低成本的方法，能够增强LLM在上下文学习中的表现。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
diverse tasks by incorporating multiple input-output examples, known as
demonstrations, into the input of LLMs. More recently, advancements in the
expanded context windows of LLMs have led to many-shot ICL, which uses hundreds
of demonstrations and outperforms few-shot ICL, which relies on fewer examples.
However, this approach is often hindered by the high cost of obtaining large
amounts of labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Many-Shot
Adaptive Pseudo-LabEling, namely MAPLE, a novel influence-based many-shot ICL
framework that utilizes pseudo-labeled samples to compensate for the lack of
label information. We first identify a subset of impactful unlabeled samples
and perform pseudo-labeling on them by querying LLMs. These pseudo-labeled
samples are then adaptively selected and tailored to each test query as input
to improve the performance of many-shot ICL, without significant labeling
costs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to enhance LLM
adaptability and performance with limited labeled data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在知识图谱工程（KGE）任务中使用大型语言模型（LLMs）时，模型大小与性能及成本的关系，发现虽然大模型通常表现更好，但某些情况下小模型更具成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs在KGE任务中的表现与模型大小的关系，以优化性能与成本的平衡。

Method: 使用LLM-KG-Bench框架评估26个开源LLMs在KGE任务中的表现，分析模型大小与性能的关系。

Result: 研究发现模型大小与性能通常正相关，但存在性能平台或天花板效应，某些情况下小模型更具成本效益。

Conclusion: 结论是模型大小并非唯一决定因素，需结合实际任务需求测试不同大小的模型以优化成本效益。

Abstract: When using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Knowledge Graph
Engineering (KGE), one of the first indications when searching for an
appropriate model is its size. According to the scaling laws, larger models
typically show higher capabilities. However, in practice, resource costs are
also an important factor and thus it makes sense to consider the ratio between
model performance and costs. The LLM-KG-Bench framework enables the comparison
of LLMs in the context of KGE tasks and assesses their capabilities of
understanding and producing KGs and KG queries. Based on a dataset created in
an LLM-KG-Bench run covering 26 open state-of-the-art LLMs, we explore the
model size scaling laws specific to KGE tasks. In our analyses, we assess how
benchmark scores evolve between different model size categories. Additionally,
we inspect how the general score development of single models and families of
models correlates to their size. Our analyses revealed that, with a few
exceptions, the model size scaling laws generally also apply to the selected
KGE tasks. However, in some cases, plateau or ceiling effects occurred, i.e.,
the task performance did not change much between a model and the next larger
model. In these cases, smaller models could be considered to achieve high
cost-effectiveness. Regarding models of the same family, sometimes larger
models performed worse than smaller models of the same family. These effects
occurred only locally. Hence it is advisable to additionally test the next
smallest and largest model of the same family.

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优异，同时提升了可解释性和交互性。

Conclusion: II-KEA为临床决策提供了更透明和灵活的工具，有望推动AI在医疗领域的应用。

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on extensive Electronic Health Records (EHR)
data have achieved high accuracy in diagnosis prediction, offering the
potential to assist clinicians in decision-making and treatment planning.
However, these models lack two crucial features that clinicians highly value:
interpretability and interactivity. The ``black-box'' nature of these models
makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind
predictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally,
the absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating
their own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address
these limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal
discovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and
agentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and
causal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to
inject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and
prompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating
superior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as
evidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies.

Conclusion: EquivPruner是一种简单有效的方法，可优化LLM推理搜索效率与准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning through search
algorithms, yet current strategies often suffer from massive token consumption
due to redundant exploration of semantically equivalent steps. Existing
semantic similarity methods struggle to accurately identify such equivalence in
domain-specific contexts like mathematical reasoning. To address this, we
propose EquivPruner, a simple yet effective approach that identifies and prunes
semantically equivalent actions during LLM reasoning search. We also introduce
MathEquiv, the first dataset we created for mathematical statement equivalence,
which enables the training of a lightweight equivalence detector. Extensive
experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate that EquivPruner
significantly reduces token consumption, improving searching efficiency and
often bolstering reasoning accuracy. For instance, when applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on GSM8K, EquivPruner reduced token consumption by
48.1\% while also improving accuracy. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，ACPO能有效减少冗余推理，并根据任务复杂度自适应调整认知分配。

Conclusion: ACPO通过透明化认知过程和动态系统切换，实现了高效的混合推理。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, but often suffer from overthinking, generating redundant
content regardless of task difficulty. Inspired by the dual process theory in
cognitive science, we propose Adaptive Cognition Policy Optimization (ACPO), a
reinforcement learning framework that enables LRMs to achieve efficient
reasoning through adaptive cognitive allocation and dynamic system switch. ACPO
incorporates two key components: (1) introducing system-aware reasoning tokens
to explicitly represent the thinking modes thereby making the model's cognitive
process transparent, and (2) integrating online difficulty estimation and token
length budget to guide adaptive system switch and reasoning during
reinforcement learning. To this end, we propose a two-stage training strategy.
The first stage begins with supervised fine-tuning to cold start the model,
enabling it to generate reasoning paths with explicit thinking modes. In the
second stage, we apply ACPO to further enhance adaptive system switch for
difficulty-aware reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPO
effectively reduces redundant reasoning while adaptively adjusting cognitive
allocation based on task complexity, achieving efficient hybrid reasoning.

Motivation: 研究人类与AI之间的竞争与合作策略，预测其进化平衡，为理解动态关系提供框架。

Method: 分析了13种EGT模型中的三种（鹰鸽博弈、重复囚徒困境、消耗战），基于其广泛接受度和相关性。

Result: EGT模型显示人类与AI可能实现平衡共同进化、认知共同进化或资源竞争中的战略共同进化。

Conclusion: EGT为理解人类-AI动态提供了框架，但未来需扩展研究范围并关注伦理和认知影响。

Abstract: The serious games between humans and AI have only just begun. Evolutionary
Game Theory (EGT) models the competitive and cooperative strategies of
biological entities. EGT could help predict the potential evolutionary
equilibrium of humans and AI. The objective of this work was to examine some of
the EGT models relevant to human-AI interaction, evolution, and coevolution. Of
thirteen EGT models considered, three were examined: the Hawk-Dove Game,
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and the War of Attrition. This selection was based
on the widespread acceptance and clear relevance of these models to potential
human-AI evolutionary dynamics and coevolutionary trajectories. The Hawk-Dove
Game predicts balanced mixed-strategy equilibria based on the costs of
conflict. It also shows the potential for balanced coevolution rather than
dominance. Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma suggests that repeated interaction may
lead to cognitive coevolution. It demonstrates how memory and reciprocity can
lead to cooperation. The War of Attrition suggests that competition for
resources may result in strategic coevolution, asymmetric equilibria, and
conventions on sharing resources. Therefore, EGT may provide a suitable
framework to understand and predict the human-AI evolutionary dynamic. However,
future research could extend beyond EGT and explore additional frameworks,
empirical validation methods, and interdisciplinary perspectives. AI is being
shaped by human input and is evolving in response to it. So too,
neuroplasticity allows the human brain to grow and evolve in response to
stimuli. If humans and AI converge in future, what might be the result of human
neuroplasticity combined with an ever-evolving AI? Future research should be
mindful of the ethical and cognitive implications of human-AI interaction,
evolution, and coevolution.

models, limiting the LRM's role in retrieval to deciding when to retrieve and
how to query. This separation not only increases hardware and operational costs
but also leads to errors in the retrieval process due to the representation
bottleneck, a phenomenon where the retriever's embedding space is not
expressive enough to meet the generator's requirements. To address this, we
shift our perspective from sequence-to-sequence matching to locating the
answer-containing paths within the corpus, and propose a novel framework called
FREESON (Retriever-FREE Retrieval-Augmented ReaSONing). This framework enables
LRMs to retrieve relevant knowledge on their own by acting as both a generator
and retriever. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of the MCTS algorithm
specialized for the retrieval task, which we call CT-MCTS (Corpus-Traversing
Monte Carlo Tree Search). In this algorithm, LRMs traverse through the corpus
toward answer-containing regions. Our results on five open-domain QA
benchmarks, including single-hop and multi-hop questions, show that FREESON
achieves an average improvement of 14.4% in EM and F1 over four multi-step
reasoning models with a separate retriever, and it also performs comparably to
the strongest baseline, surpassing it by 3% on PopQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现推理模型存在内部偏见，导致过度思考；通过屏蔽输入部分可减少推理长度并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示推理模型过度思考的原因，即内部偏见对决策的影响。

Method: 通过解释性实验发现内部偏见源于对输入部分的过度关注，并通过屏蔽输入验证其影响。

Result: 屏蔽输入部分可减少推理长度31%-53%，并提升准确性。

Conclusion: 内部偏见与过度思考存在因果关系，屏蔽输入是有效缓解方法。

Abstract: While current reasoning models possess strong exploratory capabilities, they
are often criticized for overthinking due to redundant and unnecessary
reflections. In this work, we reveal for the first time that overthinking in
reasoning models may stem from their internal bias towards input texts. Upon
encountering a reasoning problem, the model immediately forms a preliminary
guess about the answer, which we term as an internal bias since it is not
derived through actual reasoning. When this guess conflicts with its reasoning
result, the model tends to engage in reflection, leading to the waste of
computational resources. Through further interpretability experiments, we find
that this behavior is largely driven by the model's excessive attention to the
input section, which amplifies the influence of internal bias on its
decision-making process. Additionally, by masking out the original input
section, the affect of internal bias can be effectively alleviated and the
reasoning length could be reduced by 31%-53% across different complex reasoning
tasks. Notably, in most cases, this approach also leads to improvements in
accuracy. These findings demonstrate a causal relationship between internal
bias and overthinking.

TL;DR: MMMR是一个新的多模态推理基准，用于评估带有显式思维的多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs-T）的推理能力，揭示其推理病理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注感知或最终答案正确性，缺乏对多模态推理过程的深入理解，需要标准化评估基准。

Method: MMMR包括1）1,083个高难度问题的数据集，涵盖六种推理类型；2）模块化推理痕迹评估管道（RTEP），通过相关性、一致性等指标评估推理质量。

Result: MLLMs-T总体优于非思维模型，但存在不一致性和过度思考等推理问题。

Conclusion: MMMR为未来模型开发提供了可扩展的评估基础，揭示了准确性与推理质量之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door
to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific
analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs,
particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T),
remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing
work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering
limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address
this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a
high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types
with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace
Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy
through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations.
Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking
counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro
suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This
benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and
provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development.
Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and
improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

Motivation: 探索如何通过自我反思和自我训练持续提升小型语言模型的推理能力，减少对大型模型或人工标注的依赖。

Method: 利用ReflectEvo管道生成大规模自我反思数据集ReflectEvo-460k，并通过SFT和DPO方法训练SLMs。

Result: Llama-3和Mistral的推理能力分别从52.4%提升至71.2%和44.4%提升至71.1%，在BIG-bench上表现优异。

Conclusion: 反射学习能持续提升SLMs的推理能力，未来有望进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: We present a novel pipeline, ReflectEvo, to demonstrate that small language
models (SLMs) can enhance meta introspection through reflection learning. This
process iteratively generates self-reflection for self-training, fostering a
continuous and self-evolving process. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct
ReflectEvo-460k, a large-scale, comprehensive, self-generated reflection
dataset with broadened instructions and diverse multi-domain tasks. Building
upon this dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of reflection learning to
improve SLMs' reasoning abilities using SFT and DPO with remarkable
performance, substantially boosting Llama-3 from 52.4% to 71.2% and Mistral
from 44.4% to 71.1%. It validates that ReflectEvo can rival or even surpass the
reasoning capability of the three prominent open-sourced models on BIG-bench
without distillation from superior models or fine-grained human annotation. We
further conduct a deeper analysis of the high quality of self-generated
reflections and their impact on error localization and correction. Our work
highlights the potential of continuously enhancing the reasoning performance of
SLMs through iterative reflection learning in the long run.

Abstract: With recent Nobel Prizes recognising AI contributions to science, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research by enhancing
productivity and reshaping the scientific method. LLMs are now involved in
experimental design, data analysis, and workflows, particularly in chemistry
and biology. However, challenges such as hallucinations and reliability
persist. In this contribution, we review how Large Language Models (LLMs) are
redefining the scientific method and explore their potential applications
across different stages of the scientific cycle, from hypothesis testing to
discovery. We conclude that, for LLMs to serve as relevant and effective
creative engines and productivity enhancers, their deep integration into all
steps of the scientific process should be pursued in collaboration and
alignment with human scientific goals, with clear evaluation metrics. The
transition to AI-driven science raises ethical questions about creativity,
oversight, and responsibility. With careful guidance, LLMs could evolve into
creative engines, driving transformative breakthroughs across scientific
disciplines responsibly and effectively. However, the scientific community must
also decide how much it leaves to LLMs to drive science, even when associations
with 'reasoning', mostly currently undeserved, are made in exchange for the
potential to explore hypothesis and solution regions that might otherwise
remain unexplored by human exploration alone.

Result: 实验验证表明，所提算法在多种网络场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 部分充电方法能有效减少能量耗尽问题，提升WRSNs的充电性能。

Abstract: Recently, Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) that leveraged the
advantage of wireless energy transfer technology have opened a promising
opportunity in solving the limited energy issue. However, an ineffective
charging strategy may reduce the charging performance. Although many practical
charging algorithms have been introduced, these studies mainly focus on
optimizing the charging path with a fully charging approach. This approach may
lead to the death of a series of sensors due to their extended charging
latency. This paper introduces a novel partial charging approach that follows a
bi-level optimized scheme to minimize energy depletion in WRSNs. We aim at
optimizing simultaneously two factors: the charging path and time. To
accomplish this, we first formulate a mathematical model of the investigated
problem. We then propose two approximate algorithms in which the optimization
of the charging path and the charging time are considered as the upper and
lower level, respectively. The first algorithm combines a Multi-start Local
Search method and a Genetic Algorithm to find a solution. The second algorithm
adopts a nested approach that utilizes the advantages of the Multitasking and
Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies. Experimental validations
on various network scenarios demonstrate that our proposed algorithms
outperform the existing works.

Method: 提出论证集合的验证稳定性概念和强相关性概念，分析其在不同语义下的计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了不完全论证框架的稳定性研究，为论证集合的验证提供了理论支持，并揭示了不同语义下的计算复杂性差异。

Abstract: The notion of relevance was proposed for stability of justification status of
a single argument in incomplete argumentation frameworks (IAFs) in 2024 by
Odekerken et al. To extend the notion, we study the relevance for stability of
verification status of a set of arguments in this paper, i.e., the
uncertainties in an IAF that have to be resolved in some situations so that
answering whether a given set of arguments is an extension obtains the same
result in every completion of the IAF. Further we propose the notion of strong
relevance for describing the necessity of resolution in all situations reaching
stability. An analysis of complexity reveals that detecting the (strong)
relevance for stability of sets of arguments can be accomplished in P time
under the most semantics discussed in the paper. We also discuss the difficulty
in finding tractable methods for relevance detection under grounded semantics.

Motivation: 现有方法局限于文本或静态视觉领域，在动态空间推理任务中表现不佳，因此需要新的方法来提升动态环境中的空间推理能力。

Method: 提出D2R框架，通过将文本推理链与动态视觉草图结合，无需微调即可增强多模态大语言模型的动态空间推理能力。

Abstract: While chains-of-thought (CoT) have advanced complex reasoning in multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), existing methods remain confined to text or
static visual domains, often faltering in dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. To
bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark
designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that
augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on
input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new
insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this
capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free
framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual
drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently
enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning. Project is open

Result: 应用于21个先进模型，发现各维度能力差异显著，证明单一准确性指标的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要更全面的指标来真实反映模型的数学问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable results on a variety of
mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes
reflect genuine mathematical reasoning or superficial pattern recognition.
Common evaluation metrics, such as final answer accuracy, fail to disentangle
the underlying competencies involved, offering limited diagnostic value. To
address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and
Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework. SMART decomposes
mathematical problem solving into four distinct dimensions: understanding,
reasoning, arithmetic, and reflection \& refinement. Each dimension is
evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and
fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. Crucially, SMART integrates an automated
self-generating and self-validating mechanism to produce and verify benchmark
data, ensuring both scalability and reliability. We apply SMART to 21
state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant
discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings
demonstrate the inadequacy of final answer accuracy as a sole metric and
motivate a new holistic metric to better capture true problem-solving
capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有推理数据集在测试抽象、多步问题（如路径寻找和复杂规则约束）时表现饱和，无法满足需求。

Method: 引入SPaRC数据集，包含1,000个2D网格路径寻找谜题，要求逐步规划并结合算术和几何规则。

Result: 人类准确率接近完美（98.0%；硬谜题为94.5%），而最佳模型（如o4-mini）表现较差（15.8%；硬谜题为1.1%）。模型常生成无效路径，且在导航和空间逻辑上出错。

Conclusion: SPaRC揭示了模型在空间推理上的局限性，并推动研究改进训练和测试时计算效率的方法。

Abstract: Existing reasoning datasets saturate and fail to test abstract, multi-step
problems, especially pathfinding and complex rule constraint satisfaction. We
introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000
2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning,
requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans
achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best
reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles).
Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and
reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic.
Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time
compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts
improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with
improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as
a window into models' spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward
new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving.

Method: 提出MCP-RADAR基准，通过五个维度（答案准确性、工具选择效率、计算资源效率、参数构建准确性和执行速度）进行客观量化评估。

Result: 评估显示不同LLM在准确性和效率之间存在显著权衡，挑战了传统的单一指标排名。

Conclusion: MCP-RADAR为开发者提供了优化工具兼容性和有效性的指导，其方法论适用于所有LLM代理工具集成框架。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from passive text generators to active
reasoning agents capable of tool interaction, the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
has emerged as a standardized framework for dynamic tool discovery and
orchestration. Despite widespread industry adoption, existing evaluation
methodologies fail to adequately assess tool utilization capabilities within
this new paradigm. This paper introduces MCP-RADAR, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in the MCP
framework through a novel five-dimensional approach measuring: answer accuracy,
tool selection efficiency, computational resource efficiency, parameter
construction accuracy, and execution speed. Unlike conventional benchmarks that
rely on subjective human evaluations or binary success metrics, MCP-RADAR
employs objective, quantifiable measurements across multiple task domains
including software engineering, mathematical reasoning, and general
problem-solving. Our evaluations of leading commercial and open-source LLMs
reveal distinctive capability profiles with significant trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and speed, challenging traditional single-metric
performance rankings. Besides, we provide valuable guidance for developers to
optimize their tools for maximum model compatibility and effectiveness. While
focused on MCP due to its standardized approach, our methodology remains
applicable across all LLM agent tool integration frameworks, providing valuable
insights for both LLM developers and tool creators to optimize the entire
LLM-tool interaction ecosystem. The implementation, configurations, and
datasets used in our evaluation are publicly available at

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive synthesis of major breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence (AI) over the past fifteen years, integrating
historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. It identifies key
inflection points in AI' s evolution by tracing the convergence of
computational resources, data access, and algorithmic innovation. The analysis
highlights how researchers enabled GPU based model training, triggered a data
centric shift with ImageNet, simplified architectures through the Transformer,
and expanded modeling capabilities with the GPT series. Rather than treating
these advances as isolated milestones, the paper frames them as indicators of
deeper paradigm shifts. By applying concepts from statistical learning theory
such as sample complexity and data efficiency, the paper explains how
researchers translated breakthroughs into scalable solutions and why the field
must now embrace data centric approaches. In response to rising privacy
concerns and tightening regulations, the paper evaluates emerging solutions
like federated learning, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), and the data
site paradigm, which reframe data access and security. In cases where real
world data remains inaccessible, the paper also assesses the utility and
constraints of mock and synthetic data generation. By aligning technical
insights with evolving data infrastructure, this study offers strategic
guidance for future AI research and policy development.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理群体决策中的复杂性和动态性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In group decision-making (GDM) scenarios, uncertainty, dynamic social
structures, and vague information present major challenges for traditional
opinion dynamics models. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel
social network group decision-making (SNGDM) framework that integrates
three-way decision (3WD) theory, dynamic network reconstruction, and linguistic
opinion representation. First, the 3WD mechanism is introduced to explicitly
model hesitation and ambiguity in agent judgments, thereby preventing
irrational decisions. Second, a connection adjustment rule based on opinion
similarity is developed, enabling agents to adaptively update their
communication links and better reflect the evolving nature of social
relationships. Third, linguistic terms are used to describe agent opinions,
allowing the model to handle subjective, vague, or incomplete information more
effectively. Finally, an integrated multi-agent decision-making framework is
constructed, which simultaneously considers individual uncertainty, opinion
evolution, and network dynamics. The proposed model is applied to a multi-UAV
cooperative decision-making scenario, where simulation results and consensus
analysis demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental comparisons further verify
the advantages of the algorithm in enhancing system stability and representing
realistic decision-making behaviors.

Motivation: MBRL方法通常忽视世界模型学习的优化，而改进世界模型的保真度和收敛时间可以显著提升下游性能。

Method: 提出了一种利用世界模型生成的短时潜在预测主动寻找高熵状态的方法，并设计了动态决定重新规划时机、规划长度和奖励与熵权重的分层规划器。

Result: 在Miniworld迷宫任务中，该方法比基础Dreamer收敛速度快50%，且训练策略所需环境步数仅为60%。

Conclusion: 该方法为MBRL提供了一种优化世界模型学习的有效途径，显著提升了样本效率和性能。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers an intuitive way to increase
the sample efficiency of model-free RL methods by simultaneously training a
world model that learns to predict the future. MBRL methods have progressed by
largely prioritising the actor; optimising the world model learning has been
neglected meanwhile. Improving the fidelity of the world model and reducing its
time to convergence can yield significant downstream benefits, one of which is
improving the ensuing performance of any actor it may train. We propose a novel
approach that anticipates and actively seeks out high-entropy states using
short-horizon latent predictions generated by the world model, offering a
principled alternative to traditional curiosity-driven methods that chase
once-novel states well after they were stumbled into. While many model
predictive control (MPC) based methods offer similar alternatives, they
typically lack commitment, synthesising multi step plans after every step. To
mitigate this, we present a hierarchical planner that dynamically decides when
to replan, planning horizon length, and the weighting between reward and
entropy. While our method can theoretically be applied to any model that trains
its own actors with solely model generated data, we have applied it to just
Dreamer as a proof of concept. Our method finishes the Miniworld procedurally
generated mazes 50% faster than base Dreamer at convergence and the policy
trained in imagination converges in only 60% of the environment steps that base
Dreamer needs.

*Wei Sun,Wen Yang,Pu Jian,Qianlong Du,Fuwei Cui,Shuo Ren,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为KTAE的新算法，通过细粒度的token级优势估计解决了现有强化学习算法（如GRPO和DAPO）在计算优势时的粗粒度问题。实验表明，结合KTAE的模型在数学推理任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法（如GRPO和DAPO）在计算优势时存在粗粒度问题，无法捕捉token级贡献，影响了模型的学习效果。

Method: 提出KTAE算法，通过统计分析和采样rollout的正确性，量化token级重要性，结合rollout级优势实现细粒度优势估计。

Result: 实验显示，GRPO+KTAE和DAPO+KTAE在五个数学推理基准测试中优于基线方法，且能以更短的响应实现更高准确率。

Conclusion: KTAE算法有效提升了token级优势估计的细粒度，显著增强了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated that integrating reinforcement learning
with rule-based rewards can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, even without supervised fine-tuning. However, prevalent
reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO and its variants like DAPO,
suffer from a coarse granularity issue when computing the advantage.
Specifically, they compute rollout-level advantages that assign identical
values to every token within a sequence, failing to capture token-specific
contributions and hindering effective learning. To address this limitation, we
propose Key-token Advantage Estimation (KTAE) - a novel algorithm that
estimates fine-grained, token-level advantages without introducing additional
models. KTAE leverages the correctness of sampled rollouts and applies
statistical analysis to quantify the importance of individual tokens within a
sequence to the final outcome. This quantified token-level importance is then
combined with the rollout-level advantage to obtain a more fine-grained
token-level advantage estimation. Empirical results show that models trained
with GRPO+KTAE and DAPO+KTAE outperform baseline methods across five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Notably, they achieve higher accuracy with
shorter responses and even surpass R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B using the same base
model.

TL;DR: GUI-explorer是一种无需训练的GUI代理，通过自主探索和知识提取解决动态环境中GUI自动化的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中GUI自动化面临UI组件误解和知识过时的关键问题，传统微调方法成本高。

Method: 提出两种机制：功能感知任务目标生成器（自主探索）和转换感知知识提取器（无监督知识挖掘）。

Result: 在SPA-Bench和AndroidWorld上的任务成功率分别为53.7%和47.4%，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: GUI-explorer无需参数更新，开源且高效，适用于新应用。

Abstract: GUI automation faces critical challenges in dynamic environments. MLLMs
suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated
knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific
knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that
incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of
Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application
functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that
automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural
information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables
systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining
of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we
develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective
screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of
structured interaction triples (observation, action, outcome). This eliminates
the need for human involvement in knowledge extraction. With a task success
rate of 53.7% on SPA-Bench and 47.4% on AndroidWorld, GUI-explorer shows
significant improvements over SOTA agents. It requires no parameter updates for
new apps. GUI-explorer is open-sourced and publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在生成教育有效的可视化解释方面能力有限，且多关注文本推理，忽视了结构化可视化对概念理解的重要性。

Method: 引入EduVisBench多领域、多级别基准，并提出EduVisAgent多代理协作框架，协调教学规划、推理分解、元认知提示和可视化设计。

Result: EduVisAgent显著优于基线模型，性能提升40.2%，生成更符合教育需求的可视化结果。

Conclusion: EduVisBench和EduVisAgent为教育场景中的视觉推理能力提供了有效评估和改进工具。

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large
vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational
contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations
remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning,
overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in
supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning
capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a
multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem
sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained
evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis
reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of
decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations
aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we
propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates
specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition,
metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show
that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2%
improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.

*Jiaqi Wang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,James Cheng,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TON是一种两阶段训练策略，通过选择性推理减少计算成本，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类选择性思考启发，探索如何在视觉语言模型中实现选择性推理以减少不必要的计算开销。

Method: 提出TON两阶段训练：1) 监督微调阶段引入'thought dropout'操作；2) GRPO阶段让模型自由决定何时推理。

Result: TON比传统GRPO减少90%的推理长度，性能不降反升。

Conclusion: TON为强化学习实现类人推理模式提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training
strategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that
encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,
leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the
human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but
think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when
reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training
strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective
'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with
empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold
start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to
freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome
rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by
up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even
improving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering
a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently
reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning
steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward
human-like reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning approaches. Our code is

Motivation: 在高风险应用中，如医疗诊断，需要更强的保证（条件覆盖保证），而现有方法仅提供平均覆盖保证（边际覆盖保证）。

Method: CondKGCP合并相似向量表示的谓词，并通过排名信息增强校准。

Result: 理论证明和综合评估验证了CondKGCP的有效性。

Conclusion: CondKGCP在保持预测集紧凑的同时，近似实现了条件覆盖保证，适用于高风险应用。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods is
crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. A recent work
applies conformal prediction to KGE methods, providing uncertainty estimates by
generating a set of answers that is guaranteed to include the true answer with
a predefined confidence level. However, existing methods provide probabilistic
guarantees averaged over a reference set of queries and answers (marginal
coverage guarantee). In high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis, a
stronger guarantee is often required: the predicted sets must provide
consistent coverage per query (conditional coverage guarantee). We propose
CondKGCP, a novel method that approximates predicate-conditional coverage
guarantees while maintaining compact prediction sets. CondKGCP merges
predicates with similar vector representations and augments calibration with
rank information. We prove the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirical
effectiveness of CondKGCP by comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have historically been used as tools
that execute narrowly defined tasks. Yet recent advances in AI have unlocked
possibilities for a new class of models that genuinely collaborate with humans
in complex reasoning, from conceptualizing problems to brainstorming solutions.
Such AI thought partners enable novel forms of collaboration and extended
cognition, yet they also pose major risks-including and beyond risks of typical
AI tools and agents. In this commentary, we systematically identify risks of AI
thought partners through a novel framework that identifies risks at multiple
levels of analysis, including Real-time, Individual, and Societal risks arising
from collaborative cognition (RISc). We leverage this framework to propose
concrete metrics for risk evaluation, and finally suggest specific mitigation
strategies for developers and policymakers. As AI thought partners continue to
proliferate, these strategies can help prevent major harms and ensure that
humans actively benefit from productive thought partnerships.

Abstract: We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks

provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible,

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including
interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and
Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context

challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies

<details>

Motivation: 代理场景中的指令通常冗长且复杂，但LLM是否能可靠遵循这些指令尚未充分研究。

Method: 构建AgentIF基准，包含50个真实代理应用的707条人工标注指令，评估指标包括代码、LLM和混合方法。

Result: 现有LLM表现普遍较差，尤其在处理复杂约束和工具规范时。

Conclusion: AgentIF为未来研究提供了基准和数据分析，揭示了LLM的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in
real-world agentic applications. Growing research efforts aim to develop
LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge:
agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints,
such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While
adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether
LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM
instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key
characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic
applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words.
(3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse
constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To
construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50
agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic
systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and
corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based
evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically
evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally
perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool
specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on
instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the
failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to
facilitate future research.

Result: 现有LLMs在语法生成上表现不佳，HyGenar显著提升了生成语法的句法和语义正确性。

Conclusion: HyGenar为LLMs在语法生成任务中的优化提供了有效方法，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Grammar plays a critical role in natural language processing and text/code
generation by enabling the definition of syntax, the creation of parsers, and
guiding structured outputs. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive capabilities across domains, their ability to infer and generate
grammars has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we aim to study
and improve the ability of LLMs for few-shot grammar generation, where grammars
are inferred from sets of a small number of positive and negative examples and
generated in Backus-Naur Form. To explore this, we introduced a novel dataset
comprising 540 structured grammar generation challenges, devised 6 metrics, and
evaluated 8 various LLMs against it. Our findings reveal that existing LLMs
perform sub-optimally in grammar generation. To address this, we propose an
LLM-driven hybrid genetic algorithm, namely HyGenar, to optimize grammar
generation. HyGenar achieves substantial improvements in both the syntactic and
semantic correctness of generated grammars across LLMs.

TL;DR: Know-The-Ropes (KtR) 框架通过任务分解和轻量级增强，提升多代理LLM在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单代理LLM存在上下文限制、角色过载和领域迁移脆弱性，传统多代理方法又带来分解模糊和验证开销问题。

Method: KtR将领域先验转化为层次化任务蓝图，递归分解为类型化子任务，并通过轻量级增强（如思维链、微调、自检）解决。

Result: 在背包问题（3-8项）中，3个代理将零样本准确率从3%提升至95%；任务分配问题（6-15项）中，6个代理在规模10时达到100%准确率，规模13-15时为84%。

Conclusion: KtR通过算法感知分解和针对性增强，使小型模型成为可靠协作工具，无需依赖大型模型。

Abstract: Single-agent LLMs hit hard limits--finite context, role overload, and brittle
domain transfer. Conventional multi-agent fixes soften those edges yet expose
fresh pains: ill-posed decompositions, fuzzy contracts, and verification
overhead that blunts the gains. We therefore present Know-The-Ropes (KtR), a
framework that converts domain priors into an algorithmic blueprint hierarchy,
in which tasks are recursively split into typed, controller-mediated subtasks,
each solved zero-shot or with the lightest viable boost (e.g.,
chain-of-thought, micro-tune, self-check). Grounded in the No-Free-Lunch
theorem, KtR trades the chase for a universal prompt for disciplined
decomposition. On the Knapsack problem (3-8 items), three GPT-4o-mini agents
raise accuracy from 3% zero-shot to 95% on size-5 instances after patching a
single bottleneck agent. On the tougher Task-Assignment problem (6-15 jobs), a
six-agent o3-mini blueprint hits 100% up to size 10 and 84% on sizes 13-15,
versus 11% zero-shot. Algorithm-aware decomposition plus targeted augmentation
thus turns modest models into reliable collaborators--no ever-larger monoliths
required.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in biomedicine but lack true causal
understanding, relying instead on correlations. This paper envisions causal LLM
agents that integrate multimodal data (text, images, genomics, etc.) and
perform intervention-based reasoning to infer cause-and-effect. Addressing this
requires overcoming key challenges: designing safe, controllable agentic
frameworks; developing rigorous benchmarks for causal evaluation; integrating
heterogeneous data sources; and synergistically combining LLMs with structured
knowledge (KGs) and formal causal inference tools. Such agents could unlock
transformative opportunities, including accelerating drug discovery through
automated hypothesis generation and simulation, enabling personalized medicine
through patient-specific causal models. This research agenda aims to foster
interdisciplinary efforts, bridging causal concepts and foundation models to

Conclusion: BCPG-NSA通过精细利用负样本中的学习信号，显著提升了长链推理模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift
from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of
rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets
becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable
components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary
existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply
equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential
learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy
Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline
RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2)
consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and
3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps
within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms
baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the
same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating
robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

Conclusion: HDFF和TXQDA结合显著提升了行人重识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video surveillance image analysis and processing is a challenging field in
computer vision, with one of its most difficult tasks being Person
Re-Identification (PRe-ID). PRe-ID aims to identify and track target
individuals who have already been detected in a network of cameras, using a
robust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research
in person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and
representation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably
discriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are
modeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional
Feature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced
to leverage and combine these two types of features in a single tensor, even
though their dimensions are not identical. To enhance the system's accuracy, we
employ Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace
learning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently
facilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality inherent in
high-order tensor data. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through
experiments on three widely-used PRe-ID datasets: VIPeR, GRID, and PRID450S.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods.

*Wen Wen,Yaohong Wu,Yue Sheng,Neil Birkbeck,Balu Adsumilli,Yilin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CP-LLM是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过双视觉编码器分别分析视频上下文和像素失真，结合语言解码器生成质量评分和描述，解决了传统VQA模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA模型缺乏对视频上下文的理解或对小失真的敏感性，而现有LLM模型将质量评分和描述分离处理。CP-LLM旨在同时解决这些问题。

Method: CP-LLM采用双视觉编码器分别处理高（视频上下文）和低（像素失真）粒度信息，结合语言解码器分析其交互作用，并通过多任务训练优化评分、描述生成和成对比较。

Result: 实验表明，CP-LLM在VQA基准测试中达到最先进的跨数据集性能，并对像素失真具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CP-LLM为实际视频质量评估提供了一种全面且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging research topic with broad
applications. Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions
and a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the
perceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based
VQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual
understanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small
distortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware
Large Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring
dual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at
both high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity,
along with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between
these aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust
quality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced
sensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is
trained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description
generation, and pairwise comparisons. Experiment results demonstrate that
CP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset performance on established VQA
benchmarks and superior robustness to pixel distortions, confirming its
efficacy for comprehensive and practical video quality assessment in real-world
scenarios.

interpretability, and realtime capabilities, and present recommendations for
image generation, dynamic scenario generation, and planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中负责识别图像文本的特定头部（OCR Head），发现其具有稀疏性低、性质独特和静态激活的特点，并通过下游任务验证了这些发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs取得了显著进展，但其在图像中定位和解释文本信息的可解释性仍存在不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过探索多种LVLMs，识别出负责文本识别的OCR Head，并分析其特性。

Result: OCR Head具有低稀疏性、独特性质和静态激活的特点，且通过CoT和掩码实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs处理图像文本的内部机制，为提升模型性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), a
gap remains, particularly regarding their interpretability and how they locate
and interpret textual information within images. In this paper, we explore
various LVLMs to identify the specific heads responsible for recognizing text
from images, which we term the Optical Character Recognition Head (OCR Head).
Our findings regarding these heads are as follows: (1) Less Sparse: Unlike
previous retrieval heads, a large number of heads are activated to extract
textual information from images. (2) Qualitatively Distinct: OCR heads possess
properties that differ significantly from general retrieval heads, exhibiting
low similarity in their characteristics. (3) Statically Activated: The
frequency of activation for these heads closely aligns with their OCR scores.
We validate our findings in downstream tasks by applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to both OCR and conventional retrieval heads and by masking these heads. We
also demonstrate that redistributing sink-token values within the OCR heads
improves performance. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the
internal mechanisms LVLMs employ in processing embedded textual information in
images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卫星影像的全球城市OD流量数据生成工具GlODGen，利用视觉语言地理基础模型提取城市语义信号，结合人口数据生成高精度的OD流量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OD流量数据获取成本高且涉及隐私问题，而卫星影像全球公开且包含丰富的城市语义信息，为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: GlODGen通过视觉语言地理基础模型从卫星影像中提取城市语义信号，结合人口数据形成区域级表示，再通过图扩散模型生成OD流量。

Result: 在四大洲六个城市的实验中，GlODGen生成的OD流量数据与真实数据高度一致，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GlODGen作为一种自动化工具，能够高效、低成本地为全球城市生成高质量的OD流量数据，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Commuting Origin-destination~(OD) flows, capturing daily population mobility
of citizens, are vital for sustainable development across cities around the
world. However, it is challenging to obtain the data due to the high cost of
travel surveys and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, we find that satellite
imagery, publicly available across the globe, contains rich urban semantic
signals to support high-quality OD flow generation, with over 98\%
expressiveness of traditional multisource hard-to-collect urban
sociodemographic, economics, land use, and point of interest data. This
inspires us to design a novel data generator, GlODGen, which can generate OD
flow data for any cities of interest around the world. Specifically, GlODGen
first leverages Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models to extract urban semantic
signals related to human mobility from satellite imagery. These features are
then combined with population data to form region-level representations, which
are used to generate OD flows via graph diffusion models. Extensive experiments
on 4 continents and 6 representative cities show that GlODGen has great
generalizability across diverse urban environments on different continents and
can generate OD flow data for global cities highly consistent with real-world
mobility data. We implement GlODGen as an automated tool, seamlessly
integrating data acquisition and curation, urban semantic feature extraction,
and OD flow generation together. It has been released at

*Yan Zhao,Zhengxue Cheng,Junxuan Zhang,Qunshan Gu,Qi Wang,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualComp是一种轻量级、统一的学习型双模态无损压缩器，针对图像和文本设计，通过结构增强和参数共享实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型压缩器多为单模态设计，多模态数据需单独模型，缺乏灵活性且效率低。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽能统一压缩，但复杂度高难以部署。

Method: DualComp基于轻量级主干，引入三种结构增强：模态统一标记化、模态切换上下文学习和模态路由专家混合，并采用重参数化训练策略。

Result: DualComp在桌面CPU上实现近实时推理（200KB/s），参数更少但压缩性能与SOTA LLM方法相当，其单模态变体在Kodak数据集上超越之前最佳图像压缩器约9%。

Conclusion: DualComp通过统一轻量设计解决了多模态压缩的灵活性和效率问题，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Most learning-based lossless compressors are designed for a single modality,
requiring separate models for multi-modal data and lacking flexibility.
However, different modalities vary significantly in format and statistical
properties, making it ineffective to use compressors that lack
modality-specific adaptations. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
offer a potential solution for modality-unified compression, their excessive
complexity hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we focus
on the two most common modalities, image and text, and propose DualComp, the
first unified and lightweight learning-based dual-modality lossless compressor.
Built on a lightweight backbone, DualComp incorporates three key structural
enhancements to handle modality heterogeneity: modality-unified tokenization,
modality-switching contextual learning, and modality-routing
mixture-of-experts. A reparameterization training strategy is also used to
boost compression performance. DualComp integrates both modality-specific and
shared parameters for efficient parameter utilization, enabling near real-time
inference (200KB/s) on desktop CPUs. With much fewer parameters, DualComp
achieves compression performance on par with the SOTA LLM-based methods for
both text and image datasets. Its simplified single-modality variant surpasses
the previous best image compressor on the Kodak dataset by about 9% using just
1.2% of the model size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于场景图的无监督检索框架SCENIR，通过图自编码器避免对标注数据的依赖，并在性能和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于卷积和Transformer的图像检索模型容易受低层次视觉特征（如颜色）的偏见影响，且缺乏语义理解。此外，基于监督图神经网络的方法依赖于不一致的文本标注。

Method: 提出SCENIR，一种基于图自编码器的无监督检索框架，无需标注数据。采用图编辑距离（GED）作为场景图相似性的确定性度量。

Result: SCENIR在性能和运行效率上优于现有视觉、多模态和监督GNN方法，并验证了在未标注数据集上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SCENIR通过无监督学习和GED度量，显著提升了图像检索的语义理解和可靠性，推动了反事实图像检索的进展。

Abstract: Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in
image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from
low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic
understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based
retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image
characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely
on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph
pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based
supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval
reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based
unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled
training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and
runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and
supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as
a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity,
replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in
image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability
of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph
generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in
counterfactual image retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为JFFRA的视频修复框架，通过联合优化光流和特征修复，显著提升了视频修复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在利用低质量输入帧时难以保持时间一致性，因此需要一种更高效的方法来利用时间信息。

Method: JFFRA框架通过迭代优化光流和特征修复，结合多尺度处理和遮挡感知损失函数，提升修复效果。

Result: 实验表明，JFFRA在去噪、去模糊和超分辨率等任务中性能显著优于现有方法，最高提升1.62 dB。

Conclusion: JFFRA通过协同优化光流和特征修复，有效解决了时间一致性问题，为视频修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video restoration have focused on recovering
high-quality video frames from low-quality inputs. Compared with static images,
the performance of video restoration significantly depends on efficient
exploitation of temporal correlations among successive video frames. The
numerous techniques make use of temporal information via flow-based strategies
or recurrent architectures. However, these methods often encounter difficulties
in preserving temporal consistency as they utilize degraded input video frames.
To resolve this issue, we propose a novel video restoration framework named
Joint Flow and Feature Refinement using Attention (JFFRA). The proposed JFFRA
is based on key philosophy of iteratively enhancing data through the
synergistic collaboration of flow (alignment) and restoration. By leveraging
previously enhanced features to refine flow and vice versa, JFFRA enables
efficient feature enhancement using temporal information. This interplay
between flow and restoration is executed at multiple scales, reducing the
dependence on precise flow estimation. Moreover, we incorporate an
occlusion-aware temporal loss function to enhance the network's capability in
eliminating flickering artifacts. Comprehensive experiments validate the
versatility of JFFRA across various restoration tasks such as denoising,
deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method demonstrates a remarkable
performance improvement of up to 1.62 dB compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DO-Merging的新方法，专门用于合并LoRA模块，解决了现有方法在LoRA上表现不佳的问题。通过解耦和正交化合并参数，显著提升了合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源模型的增多，模型合并成为减少训练、存储和推理成本的重要方法。然而，现有方法主要针对全微调模型，忽略了流行的LoRA模块，导致合并效果不佳。

Method: 提出DO-Merging方法，将参数分解为幅度和方向分量并独立合并，同时引入无数据、分层梯度下降和正交约束以减少干扰。

Result: 实验证明，DO-Merging在视觉、语言和多模态任务中显著优于现有方法，且各组件可灵活集成现有方法。

Conclusion: DO-Merging通过解耦和正交化合并参数，有效提升了LoRA模块的合并性能，为模型合并提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With more open-source models available for diverse tasks, model merging has
gained attention by combining models into one, reducing training, storage, and
inference costs. Current research mainly focuses on model merging for full
fine-tuning, overlooking the popular LoRA. However, our empirical analysis
reveals that: a) existing merging methods designed for full fine-tuning perform
poorly on LoRA; b) LoRA modules show much larger parameter magnitude variance
than full fine-tuned weights; c) greater parameter magnitude variance
correlates with worse merging performance. Considering that large magnitude
variances cause deviations in the distribution of the merged parameters,
resulting in information loss and performance degradation, we propose a
Decoupled and Orthogonal merging approach(DO-Merging). By separating parameters
into magnitude and direction components and merging them independently, we
reduce the impact of magnitude differences on the directional alignment of the
merged models, thereby preserving task information. Furthermore, we introduce a
data-free, layer-wise gradient descent method with orthogonal constraints to
mitigate interference during the merging of direction components. We provide
theoretical guarantees for both the decoupling and orthogonal components. And
we validate through extensive experiments across vision, language, and
multi-modal domains that our proposed DO-Merging can achieve significantly
higher performance than existing merging methods at a minimal cost. Notably,
each component can be flexibly integrated with existing methods, offering near
free-lunch improvements across tasks.

TL;DR: CoNav是一个协作跨模态推理框架，通过3D-text模型指导图像-文本导航代理，解决导航中的模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在融合2D图像、3D点云和文本指令时面临多模态数据稀缺和信念冲突的挑战。

Method: 引入跨模态信念对齐，通过共享3D-text模型的文本假设指导导航代理，并轻量级微调。

Result: 在四个导航基准和两个空间推理基准上显著提升性能，路径更短（SPL更高）。

Conclusion: CoNav展示了多模态融合在导航中的潜力，但仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Embodied navigation demands comprehensive scene understanding and precise
spatial reasoning. While image-text models excel at interpreting pixel-level
color and lighting cues, 3D-text models capture volumetric structure and
spatial relationships. However, unified fusion approaches that jointly fuse 2D
images, 3D point clouds, and textual instructions face challenges in limited
availability of triple-modality data and difficulty resolving conflicting
beliefs among modalities. In this work, we introduce CoNav, a collaborative
cross-modal reasoning framework where a pretrained 3D-text model explicitly
guides an image-text navigation agent by providing structured spatial-semantic
knowledge to resolve ambiguities during navigation. Specifically, we introduce
Cross-Modal Belief Alignment, which operationalizes this cross-modal guidance
by simply sharing textual hypotheses from the 3D-text model to the navigation
agent. Through lightweight fine-tuning on a small 2D-3D-text corpus, the
navigation agent learns to integrate visual cues with spatial-semantic
knowledge derived from the 3D-text model, enabling effective reasoning in
embodied navigation. CoNav achieves significant improvements on four standard
embodied navigation benchmarks (R2R, CVDN, REVERIE, SOON) and two spatial
reasoning benchmarks (ScanQA, SQA3D). Moreover, under close navigation Success
Rate, CoNav often generates shorter paths compared to other methods (as
measured by SPL), showcasing the potential and challenges of fusing data from
different modalities in embodied navigation. Project Page:

Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索器在处理属性聚焦查询时表现不佳，尤其是CLIP类检索器，其图像嵌入过于关注全局语义而忽略细节。

Method: 提出了COCO-Facet基准测试，并设计了一种基于提示的图像嵌入方法，通过预定义提示和线性近似策略优化性能。

Result: 实验表明，基于提示的图像嵌入方法显著提升了检索性能，预定义提示和线性近似策略分别带来15%和8%的Recall@5提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通用图像嵌入在处理属性聚焦查询时效果有限，而基于提示的图像嵌入方法是一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide
crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of
this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual
attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling
attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with
9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like
retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot
ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image
embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other
details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with
this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image
embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose
to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers,
which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for
deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base
retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two
acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear
approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5
when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when
prompts are only available during inference.

Motivation: 遥感图像-文本检索在信息解释和灾害监测中至关重要，但现有对称适配器方法因文本模态的强判别性导致图像表示学习受限。

Method: 设计了跨模态非对称适配器（CMAA）和双任务一致性损失（DTCL），分别通过视觉增强适配器（VEA）和文本语义适配器（TSA）优化特征对齐，并通过多约束提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在RSICD和RSITMD数据集上，RDB方法在mR指标上比现有PEFT方法提升6%-11%，比全微调GeoRSCLIP模型提升1.15%-2%。

Conclusion: RDB方法有效解决了模态不平衡问题，显著提升了遥感图像-文本检索的性能。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR) plays a critical role in
geographic information interpretation, disaster monitoring, and urban planning
by establishing semantic associations between image and textual descriptions.
Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Vision-and-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models typically adopt symmetric adapter structures for
exploring cross-modal correlations. However, the strong discriminative nature
of text modality may dominate the optimization process and inhibits image
representation learning. The nonnegligible imbalanced cross-modal optimization
remains a bottleneck to enhancing the model performance. To address this issue,
this study proposes a Representation Discrepancy Bridging (RDB) method for the
RSITR task. On the one hand, a Cross-Modal Asymmetric Adapter (CMAA) is
designed to enable modality-specific optimization and improve feature
alignment. The CMAA comprises a Visual Enhancement Adapter (VEA) and a Text
Semantic Adapter (TSA). VEA mines fine-grained image features by Differential
Attention (DA) mechanism, while TSA identifies key textual semantics through
Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism. On the other hand, this study extends
the traditional single-task retrieval framework to a dual-task optimization
framework and develops a Dual-Task Consistency Loss (DTCL). The DTCL improves
cross-modal alignment robustness through an adaptive weighted combination of
cross-modal, classification, and exponential moving average consistency
constraints. Experiments on RSICD and RSITMD datasets show that the proposed
RDB method achieves a 6%-11% improvement in mR metrics compared to
state-of-the-art PEFT methods and a 1.15%-2% improvement over the full
fine-tuned GeoRSCLIP model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理模型仅依赖自然语言，缺乏视觉信息的显式整合，限制了推理链的清晰性和视觉基础性。

Method: 提出GRIT方法，结合自然语言和边界框坐标生成推理链，并采用GRPO-GR强化学习算法优化模型。

Result: GRIT仅需少量数据（20个图像-问题-答案三元组）即可高效训练模型，生成连贯且视觉基础的推理链。

Conclusion: GRIT成功统一了推理和视觉基础能力，为多模态语言模型提供了更高效的训练方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in building reasoning models that articulate chains of thoughts prior to
producing final answers. However, despite ongoing advances that aim at enabling
reasoning for vision-language tasks, existing open-source visual reasoning
models typically generate reasoning content with pure natural language, lacking
explicit integration of visual information. This limits their ability to
produce clearly articulated and visually grounded reasoning chains. To this
end, we propose Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT), a novel method
for training MLLMs to think with images. GRIT introduces a grounded reasoning
paradigm, in which models generate reasoning chains that interleave natural
language and explicit bounding box coordinates. These coordinates point to
regions of the input image that the model consults during its reasoning
process. Additionally, GRIT is equipped with a reinforcement learning approach,
GRPO-GR, built upon the GRPO algorithm. GRPO-GR employs robust rewards focused
on the final answer accuracy and format of the grounded reasoning output, which
eliminates the need for data with reasoning chain annotations or explicit
bounding box labels. As a result, GRIT achieves exceptional data efficiency,
requiring as few as 20 image-question-answer triplets from existing datasets.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GRIT effectively trains MLLMs to
produce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, showing a successful
unification of reasoning and grounding abilities.

Result: 在BraTS2019数据集上，Dice相似系数提升超2%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReHyDIL有效解决模态缺失问题，提升分割性能且避免遗忘已学信息。

Abstract: Existing methods for multimodal MRI segmentation with missing modalities
typically assume that all MRI modalities are available during training.
However, in clinical practice, some modalities may be missing due to the
sequential nature of MRI acquisition, leading to performance degradation.
Furthermore, retraining models to accommodate newly available modalities can be
inefficient and may cause overfitting, potentially compromising previously
learned knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Replay-based
Hypergraph Domain Incremental Learning (ReHyDIL) for brain tumor segmentation
with missing modalities. ReHyDIL leverages Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) to
enable the segmentation model to learn from newly acquired MRI modalities
without forgetting previously learned information. To enhance segmentation
performance across diverse patient scenarios, we introduce the Cross-Patient
Hypergraph Segmentation Network (CHSNet), which utilizes hypergraphs to capture
high-order associations between patients. Additionally, we incorporate
Tversky-Aware Contrastive (TAC) loss to effectively mitigate information
imbalance both across and within different modalities. Extensive experiments on
the BraTS2019 dataset demonstrate that ReHyDIL outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving an improvement of over 2\% in the Dice Similarity
Coefficient across various tumor regions. Our code is available at ReHyDIL.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上生成多样化的攻击性驾驶场景，显著提高多个先进自动驾驶模型的碰撞率。

Conclusion: Challenger能够生成逼真的对抗性驾驶视频，有效测试自动驾驶系统的鲁棒性，且对抗行为具有跨模型迁移性。

Abstract: Generating photorealistic driving videos has seen significant progress
recently, but current methods largely focus on ordinary, non-adversarial
scenarios. Meanwhile, efforts to generate adversarial driving scenarios often
operate on abstract trajectory or BEV representations, falling short of
delivering realistic sensor data that can truly stress-test autonomous driving
(AD) systems. In this work, we introduce Challenger, a framework that produces
physically plausible yet photorealistic adversarial driving videos. Generating
such videos poses a fundamental challenge: it requires jointly optimizing over
the space of traffic interactions and high-fidelity sensor observations.
Challenger makes this affordable through two techniques: (1) a physics-aware
multi-round trajectory refinement process that narrows down candidate
adversarial maneuvers, and (2) a tailored trajectory scoring function that
encourages realistic yet adversarial behavior while maintaining compatibility
with downstream video synthesis. As tested on the nuScenes dataset, Challenger
generates a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios-including cut-ins,
sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions-and renders them
into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations show that these
scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art
end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), and
importantly, adversarial behaviors discovered for one model often transfer to
others.

TL;DR: 论文提出Let Androids Dream (LAD)框架，通过三阶段方法解决图像隐喻理解问题，性能优于现有MLLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在理解图像隐喻时存在文化、情感和上下文缺失的挑战，LAD旨在填补这一空白。

Method: LAD采用三阶段框架：感知（视觉信息转文本）、搜索（跨领域知识整合）、推理（生成上下文对齐的隐喻解释）。

Result: LAD在英文和中文图像隐喻基准测试中表现优异，性能接近GPT-4o，并在开放式问题上超越36.7%。

Conclusion: LAD为AI理解图像隐喻提供了新思路，推动了视觉语言推理和人机交互领域的发展。

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI
systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,
and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they
struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual
gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their
abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let
Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and
reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:
(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual
representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain
knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment
image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight
GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English
image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,
performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)
and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work
provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image
implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI
interaction. Our project is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在高分辨率图像生成中难以同时保持全局语义结构和区域细节的创造性。

Method: 利用全局提示和通过多模态LLM估计的区域提示，结合低频分量作为全局结构先验，并通过区域注意力控制生成区域细节。

Result: C-Upscale能够生成超高分辨率图像（如4,096 X 4,096和8,192 X 8,192），具有更高的视觉保真度和创造性区域细节。

Conclusion: C-Upscale通过全局-区域先验的结合，有效解决了高分辨率图像生成中的语义一致性和细节创造性问题。

Abstract: Contemporary diffusion models show remarkable capability in text-to-image
generation, while still being limited to restricted resolutions (e.g., 1,024 X
1,024). Recent advances enable tuning-free higher-resolution image generation
by recycling pre-trained diffusion models and extending them via regional
denoising or dilated sampling/convolutions. However, these models struggle to
simultaneously preserve global semantic structure and produce creative regional
details in higher-resolution images. To address this, we present C-Upscale, a
new recipe of tuning-free image upscaling that pivots on global-regional priors
derived from given global prompt and estimated regional prompts via Multimodal
LLM. Technically, the low-frequency component of low-resolution image is
recognized as global structure prior to encourage global semantic consistency
in high-resolution generation. Next, we perform regional attention control to
screen cross-attention between global prompt and each region during regional
denoising, leading to regional attention prior that alleviates object
repetition issue. The estimated regional prompts containing rich descriptive
details further act as regional semantic prior to fuel the creativity of
regional detail generation. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our C-Upscale manages to generate ultra-high-resolution images
(e.g., 4,096 X 4,096 and 8,192 X 8,192) with higher visual fidelity and more
creative regional details.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) have introduced
LLM-based agents, modular frameworks, and procedural solutions, yielding
promising results. These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms
to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant
improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and
decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with
language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work
presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA)
that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside
YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes
a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced
performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also
enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and
providing valuable support for verification and increased output reliability

Motivation: 由于扩散模型的内在随机性，现有方法难以完全保留服装的形状和细节，因此需要一种更有效的方法来改进虚拟试穿任务。

Conclusion: 通过引入视觉对应性和3D感知线索，该方法有效解决了虚拟试穿任务中服装细节保留的挑战。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown preliminary success in virtual try-on (VTON)
task. The typical dual-branch architecture comprises two UNets for implicit
garment deformation and synthesized image generation respectively, and has
emerged as the recipe for VTON task. Nevertheless, the problem remains
challenging to preserve the shape and every detail of the given garment due to
the intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion model. To alleviate this issue, we
novelly propose to explicitly capitalize on visual correspondence as the prior
to tame diffusion process instead of simply feeding the whole garment into UNet
as the appearance reference. Specifically, we interpret the fine-grained
appearance and texture details as a set of structured semantic points, and
match the semantic points rooted in garment to the ones over target person
through local flow warping. Such 2D points are then augmented into 3D-aware
cues with depth/normal map of target person. The correspondence mimics the way
of putting clothing on human body and the 3D-aware cues act as semantic point
matching to supervise diffusion model training. A point-focused diffusion loss
is further devised to fully take the advantage of semantic point matching.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong garment detail preservation of our
approach, evidenced by state-of-the-art VTON performances on both VITON-HD and
DressCode datasets. Code is publicly available at:

Abstract: With video games now generating the highest revenues in the entertainment
industry, optimizing game development workflows has become essential for the
sector's sustained growth. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
offer considerable potential to automate and enhance various aspects of game
development, particularly Quality Assurance (QA), which remains one of the
industry's most labor-intensive processes with limited automation options. To
accurately evaluate the performance of VLMs in video game QA tasks and
determine their effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios, there is a
clear need for standardized benchmarks, as existing benchmarks are insufficient
to address the specific requirements of this domain. To bridge this gap, we
introduce VideoGameQA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a wide array
of game QA activities, including visual unit testing, visual regression
testing, needle-in-a-haystack tasks, glitch detection, and bug report
generation for both images and videos of various games. Code and data are

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，VFID分数提升60.5%。

Conclusion: DPIDM通过动态姿势交互显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly dress a subject in a video with a
specific garment. The primary challenge involves preserving the visual
authenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique
of the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on
image-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often
results in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on
approaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet
still overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and
garment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial
alignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for
the temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such
motivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction
Diffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic
pose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a
skeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses
into the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely
designed to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term
human pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized
attention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency.
Extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods. Notably, DPIDM
achieves VFID score of 0.506 on VVT dataset, leading to 60.5% improvement over
the state-of-the-art GPD-VVTO approach.

Conclusion: 运动模糊可成为超分辨率的助力，结合凸优化和稀疏先验，能实现大幅分辨率提升。

Abstract: We consider the limits of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Due to
various theoretical and practical limitations, reconstruction-based methods
have been largely restricted to small increases in resolution. In addition,
motion-blur is usually seen as a nuisance that impedes super-resolution. We
show that by using high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and
convex optimization, it is possible to increase resolution by large factors. A
key operation in super-resolution is deconvolution with a box. In general,
convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we obtain perfect
reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We also show that
motion blur can be helpful for super-resolution. We demonstrate that using
pseudo-random motion it is possible to reconstruct a high-resolution target
using a single low-resolution image. We present numerical experiments with
simulated data and results with real data captured by a camera mounted on a
computer controlled stage.

Abstract: Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic
images from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify
multiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective
handling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content
and spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement
learning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building
upon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to
autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined
templates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this,
we propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs
to evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective
supervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses
semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench
benchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial
relationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in
image generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning
capabilities to the visual generation domain. To facilitate future research, we

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）容易产生与视觉输入不符的幻觉内容，现有方法依赖预定义或随机编辑的负样本，效果有限。

Method: 提出在线视觉语言偏好学习（OViP）框架，动态生成基于模型自身幻觉输出的对比数据，并使用扩散模型合成负样本图像。

Result: 实验表明，OViP有效减少幻觉，同时保持多模态能力。

Conclusion: OViP通过实时生成相关监督信号，提升了模型对齐能力，并在幻觉抑制和表达能力之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination,
often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. While recent approaches
advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate
hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative
samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy.
In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP)
framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the
model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between
sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion
model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This
failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual
preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better
capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness.
Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP
effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal
capabilities.

Conclusion: 像素空间推理对提升视觉任务性能至关重要，论文提出的框架有效解决了视觉语言模型在视觉推理中的挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning
process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its
effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we
introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel
framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual
reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable
VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby
enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space
reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the
model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly
introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a
two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on
synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual
operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a
curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space
reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can
interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos
to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning
benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on
TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy
achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the
importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: The ImageNet hierarchy provides a structured taxonomy of object categories,
offering a valuable lens through which to analyze the representations learned
by deep vision models. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how
vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as
an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the
discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to
vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the
ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that
SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an
implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these
representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model
DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize
hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token
through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic
hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the
potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.

Abstract: Exploring the trustworthiness of deep learning models is crucial, especially
in critical domains such as medical imaging decision support systems. Conformal
prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models
with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. However, conformal
prediction results face challenges due to the backbone model's struggles in
domain-shifted scenarios, such as variations in different sources. To aim this
challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework termed Conformal Ensemble of
Vision Transformers (CE-ViTs) designed to enhance image classification
performance by prioritizing domain adaptation and model robustness, while
accounting for uncertainty. The proposed method leverages an ensemble of vision
transformer models in the backbone, trained on diverse datasets including
HAM10000, Dermofit, and Skin Cancer ISIC datasets. This ensemble learning
approach, calibrated through the combined mentioned datasets, aims to enhance
domain adaptation through conformal learning. Experimental results underscore
that the framework achieves a high coverage rate of 90.38\%, representing an
improvement of 9.95\% compared to the HAM10000 model. This indicates a strong
likelihood that the prediction set includes the true label compared to singular
models. Ensemble learning in CE-ViTs significantly improves conformal
prediction performance, increasing the average prediction set size for
challenging misclassified samples from 1.86 to 3.075.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a
target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance
transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a
diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion
models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation
process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a
pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent
translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a
CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual
loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on
two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to
comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to
realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with
CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves
high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising
alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.

current approaches face critical limitations in generalization, adaptability,
and real-world problem-solving flexibility. We propose that developing
intelligent agentic systems, capable of dynamically selecting, combining, and
optimizing existing image processing tools, represents the next evolutionary
step for the field. Such systems would emulate human experts' ability to
strategically orchestrate different tools to solve complex problems, overcoming
the brittleness of monolithic models. The paper analyzes key limitations of
model-centric paradigms, establishes design principles for agentic image
processing systems, and outlines different capability levels for such agents.

Abstract: Perceiving pedestrians in highly crowded urban environments is a difficult
long-tail problem for learning-based autonomous perception. Speeding up 3D
ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet
very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured
pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system
design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view
LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded
pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling
system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and
multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and
the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution
representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive
experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian
tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency. The code will be
publicly available at this HTTP URL.

Abstract: Leaf diseases are harmful conditions that affect the health, appearance and
productivity of plants, leading to significant plant loss and negatively
impacting farmers' livelihoods. These diseases cause visible symptoms such as
lesions, color changes, and texture variations, making it difficult for farmers
to manage plant health, especially in large or remote farms where expert
knowledge is limited. The main motivation of this study is to provide an
efficient and accessible solution for identifying plant leaf diseases in
Bangladesh, where agriculture plays a critical role in food security. The
objective of our research is to classify 21 distinct leaf diseases across six
plants using deep learning models, improving disease detection accuracy while
reducing the need for expert involvement. Deep Learning (DL) techniques,
including CNN and Transfer Learning (TL) models like VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2,
InceptionV3, ResNet50V2 and Xception are used. VGG19 and Xception achieve the
highest accuracies, with 98.90% and 98.66% respectively. Additionally,
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM
and FasterScoreCAM are used to enhance transparency by highlighting the regions
of the models focused on during disease classification. This transparency
ensures that farmers can understand the model's predictions and take necessary
action. This approach not only improves disease management but also supports
farmers in making informed decisions, leading to better plant protection and
increased agricultural productivity.

Abstract: The brain is a highly complex organ that manages many important tasks,
including movement, memory and thinking. Brain-related conditions, like tumors
and degenerative disorders, can be hard to diagnose and treat. Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) serves as a key tool for identifying these conditions,
offering high-resolution images of brain structures. Despite this, interpreting
MRI scans can be complicated. This study tackles this challenge by conducting a
comparative analysis of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Transfer Learning (TL)
models such as VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50V2, MobilenetV2 for classifying brain
diseases using MRI data from Bangladesh based dataset. ViT, known for their
ability to capture global relationships in images, are particularly effective
for medical imaging tasks. Transfer learning helps to mitigate data constraints
by fine-tuning pre-trained models. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) methods
such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM, and Faster-ScoreCAM are
employed to interpret model predictions. The results demonstrate that ViT
surpasses transfer learning models, achieving a classification accuracy of
94.39%. The integration of XAI methods enhances model transparency, offering
crucial insights to aid medical professionals in diagnosing brain diseases with

TL;DR: GMatch是一种无需学习的特征匹配方法，用于鲁棒的6DoF物体姿态估计，通过几何一致性解决稀疏特征匹配中的局部模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖描述符相似性，容易受到局部模糊性的影响，GMatch旨在通过几何一致性提升匹配的鲁棒性。

Method: GMatch采用增量搜索并强制执行SE(3)不变的几何一致性，利用几何特征唯一确定3D关键点配置。

Result: 在HOPE和YCB-Video数据集上，GMatch-SIFT表现优于传统和基于学习的方法，具有高精度和低方差。

Conclusion: GMatch-SIFT不仅验证了其在物体姿态估计中的有效性，还展示了作为通用特征匹配器的广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present GMatch, a learning-free feature matcher designed for robust 6DoF
object pose estimation, addressing common local ambiguities in sparse feature
matching. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on descriptor similarity,
GMatch performs a guided, incremental search, enforcing SE(3)-invariant
geometric consistency throughout the matching process. It leverages a provably
complete set of geometric features that uniquely determine 3D keypoint
configurations, ensuring globally consistent correspondences without the need
for training or GPU support. When combined with classical descriptors such as
SIFT, GMatch-SIFT forms a general-purpose pose estimation pipeline that offers
strong interpretability and generalization across diverse objects and scenes.
Experiments on the HOPE dataset show that GMatch outperforms both traditional
and learning-based matchers, with GMatch-SIFT achieving or surpassing the
performance of instance-level pose networks. On the YCB-Video dataset,
GMatch-SIFT demonstrates high accuracy and low variance on texture-rich
objects. These results not only validate the effectiveness of GMatch-SIFT for
object pose estimation but also highlight the broader applicability of GMatch
as a general-purpose feature matcher. Code will be released upon acceptance.

*Zhenglin Hua,Jinghan He,Zijun Yao,Tianxu Han,Haiyun Guo,Yuheng Jia,Junfeng Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的方法（SSL），用于减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉问题，无需额外训练，且效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在多模态任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题（生成与视觉输入不一致的文本），现有方法计算成本高，且效果有限。

Method: 利用SAE识别与幻觉或实际语义相关的方向，提出SSL方法，通过调整这些方向来抑制幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，SSL能显著减少幻觉，且在不同模型架构中具有可迁移性，计算开销低。

Conclusion: SSL是一种高效、无需训练的方法，能有效解决LVLM的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning.
However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent
with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications.
Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external
knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which
require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore
more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations.
Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently
suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal
semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify
semantic directions closely associated with either hallucinations or actuality,
realizing more precise and direct hallucination-related representations. Our
analysis demonstrates that interventions along the faithful direction we
identified can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory
direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering
LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a training-free method based on
SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding
approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability
across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

TL;DR: REVEAL框架结合视觉语言模型和标签清理方法，解决图像分类数据集中噪声标签和缺失标签问题，显著提升6个基准测试集的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类数据集（如CIFAR、MNIST、ImageNet）存在噪声标签和缺失标签问题，导致模型评估不准确。现有方法主要关注噪声标签，而缺失标签问题被忽视。

Method: REVEAL整合预训练视觉语言模型（如LLaVA、BLIP）和标签清理方法（如Docta、Cleanlab），通过置信度预测和共识过滤检测噪声标签和缺失标签。

Result: REVEAL显著提升了6个基准测试集的标签质量，并通过人类验证证明其与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: REVEAL为图像分类数据集提供了更准确的标签，支持更公平和有效的模型评估。

Abstract: Image classification benchmark datasets such as CIFAR, MNIST, and ImageNet
serve as critical tools for model evaluation. However, despite the cleaning
efforts, these datasets still suffer from pervasive noisy labels and often
contain missing labels due to the co-existing image pattern where multiple
classes appear in an image sample. This results in misleading model comparisons
and unfair evaluations. Existing label cleaning methods focus primarily on
noisy labels, but the issue of missing labels remains largely overlooked.
Motivated by these challenges, we present a comprehensive framework named
REVEAL, integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models (e.g.,
LLaVA, BLIP, Janus, Qwen) with advanced machine/human label curation methods
(e.g., Docta, Cleanlab, MTurk), to systematically address both noisy labels and
missing label detection in widely-used image classification test sets. REVEAL
detects potential noisy labels and omissions, aggregates predictions from
various methods, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed
predictions and consensus-based filtering. Additionally, we provide a thorough
analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained image
classifiers, highlighting their strengths and limitations within the context of
dataset renovation by revealing 10 observations. Our method effectively reveals
missing labels from public datasets and provides soft-labeled results with
likelihoods. Through human verifications, REVEAL significantly improves the
quality of 6 benchmark test sets, highly aligning to human judgments and
enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展推理能力到多模态LLM时面临高成本和高质量数据集稀缺的问题，FRANK Model旨在无需训练或额外监督的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分层权重合并方法，结合视觉预训练MLLM和推理专用LLM，利用泰勒导出的闭式融合机制在深层解码器中集成推理能力。

Result: 在MMMU基准测试中，FRANK-38B以69.2的准确率超越最强基线InternVL2.5-38B（+5.3），甚至优于专有GPT-4o模型。

Conclusion: FRANK Model通过分层融合方法有效提升了多模态推理能力，无需额外训练或监督，展示了显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1) have
showcased impressive reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning.
However, extending these capabilities to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is hampered by
the prohibitive costs of retraining and the scarcity of high-quality,
verifiable multimodal reasoning datasets. This paper introduces FRANK Model, a
training-FRee ANd r1-liKe MLLM that imbues off-the-shelf MLLMs with reasoning
and reflection abilities, without any gradient updates or extra supervision.
Our key insight is to decouple perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder
layers. Specifically, we observe that compared to the deeper decoder layers,
the shallow decoder layers allocate more attention to visual tokens, while the
deeper decoder layers concentrate on textual semantics. This observation
motivates a hierarchical weight merging approach that combines a
visual-pretrained MLLM with a reasoning-specialized LLM. To this end, we
propose a layer-wise, Taylor-derived closed-form fusion mechanism that
integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while preserving visual
grounding in shallow decoder layers. Extensive experiments on challenging
multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
On the MMMU benchmark, our model FRANK-38B achieves an accuracy of 69.2,
outperforming the strongest baseline InternVL2.5-38B by +5.3, and even
surpasses the proprietary GPT-4o model. Our project homepage is at:

Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法无法直接应用于MDE模型，因其标签为深度图形式，需填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出BadDepth，利用图像分割模型选择性操纵目标物体深度，并通过深度补全恢复周围区域，生成毒化数据集；引入数字到物理增强以提高物理世界鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个模型上的实验验证了BadDepth在数字和物理世界中的有效性，且不受环境因素影响。

Conclusion: BadDepth为MDE模型后门攻击提供了首个解决方案，展示了其在现实场景中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models
have been widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics.
However, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To fill
the gap in this area, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of backdoor
attacks against MDE models. Typically, existing backdoor attack methods can not
be applied to MDE models. This is because the label used in MDE is in the form
of a depth map. To address this, we propose BadDepth, the first backdoor attack
targeting MDE models. BadDepth overcomes this limitation by selectively
manipulating the target object's depth using an image segmentation model and
restoring the surrounding areas via depth completion, thereby generating
poisoned datasets for object-level backdoor attacks. To improve robustness in
physical world scenarios, we further introduce digital-to-physical augmentation
to adapt to the domain gap between the physical world and the digital domain.
Extensive experiments on multiple models validate the effectiveness of BadDepth
in both the digital domain and the physical world, without being affected by
environmental factors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RELA的线性注意力增强方法，并基于此构建了高效图像修复Transformer模型LAformer，解决了传统Transformer在高分辨率图像处理中的复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在图像修复任务中表现优异，但其自注意力的二次复杂度限制了在高分辨率图像上的应用。现有方法通过稀疏或窗口注意力缓解问题，但牺牲了全局上下文建模能力。

Method: 提出Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA)，通过轻量级深度卷积增强特征表示；构建LAformer模型，结合线性注意力和通道注意力实现全局感知，并通过卷积门控前馈网络增强局部拟合能力。

Result: LAformer在7个图像修复任务和21个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并显著提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: LAformer通过消除硬件低效操作（如softmax和窗口移位），实现了高效的高分辨率图像处理，同时保持了优异的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made remarkable progress in image restoration
(IR) tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer
hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate
this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global
context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention,
demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear
complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its
efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant
performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention
map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a
simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by
integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose
an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer.
LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention
and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through
a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates
hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling
efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7
IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods
and offers significant computational advantages.

Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration aims to specifically solve the
problem of quality degradation in ultra-high-resolution images. Recent
advancements in this field are predominantly driven by deep learning-based
innovations, including enhancements in dataset construction, network
architecture, sampling strategies, prior knowledge integration, and loss
functions. In this paper, we systematically review recent progress in UHD image
restoration, covering various aspects ranging from dataset construction to
algorithm design. This serves as a valuable resource for understanding
state-of-the-art developments in the field. We begin by summarizing degradation
models for various image restoration subproblems, such as super-resolution,
low-light enhancement, deblurring, dehazing, deraining, and desnowing, and
emphasizing the unique challenges of their application to UHD image
restoration. We then highlight existing UHD benchmark datasets and organize the
literature according to degradation types and dataset construction methods.
Following this, we showcase major milestones in deep learning-driven UHD image
restoration, reviewing the progression of restoration tasks, technological
developments, and evaluations of existing methods. We further propose a
classification framework based on network architectures and sampling
strategies, helping to clearly organize existing methods. Finally, we share
insights into the current research landscape and propose directions for further

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR地点识别方法仅依赖几何信息，忽略了反射率数据，导致在几何退化、高几何相似性和动态对象等场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出RE-TRIP描述符，包括关键点提取、关键实例分割、匹配方法和反射率结合环路验证方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，RE-TRIP在性能上优于现有方法（如Scan Context、Intensity Scan Context和STD）。

Conclusion: RE-TRIP通过结合几何和反射率信息，显著提升了地点识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: While most people associate LiDAR primarily with its ability to measure
distances and provide geometric information about the environment (via point
clouds), LiDAR also captures additional data, including reflectivity or
intensity values. Unfortunately, when LiDAR is applied to Place Recognition
(PR) in mobile robotics, most previous works on LiDAR-based PR rely only on
geometric measurements, neglecting the additional reflectivity information that
LiDAR provides. In this paper, we propose a novel descriptor for 3D PR, named
RE-TRIP (REflectivity-instance augmented TRIangle descriPtor). This new
descriptor leverages both geometric measurements and reflectivity to enhance
robustness in challenging scenarios such as geometric degeneracy, high
geometric similarity, and the presence of dynamic objects. To implement RE-TRIP
in real-world applications, we further propose (1) a keypoint extraction
method, (2) a key instance segmentation method, (3) a RE-TRIP matching method,
and (4) a reflectivity-combined loop verification method. Finally, we conduct a
series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of RE-TRIP. Applied to
public datasets (i.e., HELIPR, FusionPortable) containing diverse scenarios
such as long corridors, bridges, large-scale urban areas, and highly dynamic
environments -- our experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Scan Context,
Intensity Scan Context, and STD.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法因生成对抗特征与真实数据分布不匹配，导致跨模型迁移性受限。

Method: TRAIL框架在攻击时更新扩散U-Net权重，结合对抗目标和感知约束，通过迭代噪声注入和去噪生成对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明TRAIL在跨模型攻击可迁移性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 分布对齐的对抗特征合成对实际黑盒攻击至关重要。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks exploiting unrestricted natural perturbations present
severe security risks to deep learning systems, yet their transferability
across models remains limited due to distribution mismatches between generated
adversarial features and real-world data. While recent works utilize
pre-trained diffusion models as adversarial priors, they still encounter
challenges due to the distribution shift between the distribution of ideal
adversarial samples and the natural image distribution learned by the diffusion
model. To address the challenge, we propose Transferable Robust Adversarial
Images via Latent Diffusion (TRAIL), a test-time adaptation framework that
enables the model to generate images from a distribution of images with
adversarial features and closely resembles the target images. To mitigate the
distribution shift, during attacks, TRAIL updates the diffusion U-Net's weights
by combining adversarial objectives (to mislead victim models) and perceptual
constraints (to preserve image realism). The adapted model then generates
adversarial samples through iterative noise injection and denoising guided by
these objectives. Experiments demonstrate that TRAIL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in cross-model attack transferability, validating that
distribution-aligned adversarial feature synthesis is critical for practical
black-box attacks.

Motivation: 研究动机是验证当前概念擦除技术是否真正移除了生成能力，而非仅针对特定提示的抑制。

Method: 采用实例级评估策略，通过轻量级微调测试擦除概念的再激活潜力，定量和定性分析两种代表性方法（Unified Concept Editing和Erased Stable Diffusion）。

Result: 结果显示，擦除的概念在轻微调整后仍能以高视觉保真度重现，表明现有方法未能完全消除生成能力。

Conclusion: 结论指出现有概念擦除方法存在局限性，需更深层次的干预和更严格的评估标准以实现概念的真正不可逆移除。

Abstract: To what extent does concept erasure eliminate generative capacity in
diffusion models? While prior evaluations have primarily focused on measuring
concept suppression under specific textual prompts, we explore a complementary
and fundamental question: do current concept erasure techniques genuinely
remove the ability to generate targeted concepts, or do they merely achieve
superficial, prompt-specific suppression? We systematically evaluate the
robustness and reversibility of two representative concept erasure methods,
Unified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, by probing their ability
to eliminate targeted generative behaviors in text-to-image models. These
methods attempt to suppress undesired semantic concepts by modifying internal
model parameters, either through targeted attention edits or model-level
fine-tuning strategies. To rigorously assess whether these techniques truly
erase generative capacity, we propose an instance-level evaluation strategy
that employs lightweight fine-tuning to explicitly test the reactivation
potential of erased concepts. Through quantitative metrics and qualitative
analyses, we show that erased concepts often reemerge with substantial visual
fidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating that current methods suppress
latent generative representations without fully eliminating them. Our findings
reveal critical limitations in existing concept erasure approaches and
highlight the need for deeper, representation-level interventions and more
rigorous evaluation standards to ensure genuine, irreversible removal of
concepts from generative models.

Abstract: Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world
applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational
lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally
prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential
video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can
take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up
to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and
memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a
system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video
understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three
key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that
achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals
processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method
using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an
overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference.
Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video
inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited
hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and
sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

### [116] [Redemption Score: An Evaluation Framework to Rank Image Captions While Redeeming Image Semantics and Language Pragmatics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16180)
*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Redemption Score是一种新颖的混合框架，通过结合三种互补信号（MID、DINO感知相似性和BERTScore）来评估图像标题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像标题评估指标未能全面捕捉视觉语义和语言语用学，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 结合MID（全局图像-文本分布对齐）、DINO（视觉基础）和BERTScore（文本相似性）三种信号进行校准融合。

Result: 在Flickr8k基准测试中，Redemption Score的Kendall-τ为56.43，优于12种现有方法，且无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: Redemption Score提供了更全面、稳健的图像标题评估，适用于多种数据集。

Abstract: Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual
semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most
metrics. We introduce Redemption Score, a novel hybrid framework that ranks
image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual
Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment,
(2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual
grounding, and (3) BERTScore for contextual text similarity against human
references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows Redemption Score to
offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, Redemption Score
achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 56.43, outperforming twelve prior methods and
demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring
task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced
evaluation by effectively redeeming image semantics and linguistic
interpretability indicated by strong transfer of knowledge in the Conceptual
Captions and MS COCO datasets.

TL;DR: 研究分析了83k个真实图像编辑请求，发现当前AI编辑器（如GPT-4o）仅能完成33%的任务，且在低创意性任务中表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨用户对图像编辑的实际需求及AI编辑器的能力限制，以改进AI工具。

Method: 分析Reddit社区12年间的83k请求和305k编辑结果，结合人类和VLM评分。

Result: AI编辑器在低创意性任务中表现不佳，且常无法保留人物或动物身份。VLM评分与人类偏好不一致。

Conclusion: AI编辑器需改进低创意性任务的处理能力，并减少非请求的修饰。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image
editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25,
2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of
editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the
subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly
creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and
the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw
lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests
can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present
a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the
past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k
PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of
requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o,
Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on
low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended
tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and
frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM
judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits
more than human edits. Code and qualitative examples are available at:

TL;DR: VLM-R³是一个视觉语言模型框架，通过动态聚焦和迭代视觉区域，提升复杂任务中的文本推理能力，并在多个基准测试中取得最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理型多模态语言模型在生成长文本推理链时表现良好，但在需要动态迭代聚焦视觉区域的复杂任务中仍有不足。

Method: 提出VLM-R³框架，结合区域识别与推理能力，通过R-GRPO训练范式优化模型选择信息区域和整合视觉上下文的能力。

Result: 在MathVista、ScienceQA等基准测试中，VLM-R³在零样本和少样本设置下均达到最新水平，尤其在需要空间推理或细粒度视觉线索的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: VLM-R³通过动态视觉聚焦和推理整合，显著提升了复杂任务中的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, reasoning-based MLLMs have achieved a degree of success in
generating long-form textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle
with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on and
revisiting of visual regions to achieve precise grounding of textual reasoning
in visual evidence. We introduce \textbf{VLM-R$^3$} (\textbf{V}isual
\textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel with \textbf{R}egion \textbf{R}ecognition and
\textbf{R}easoning), a framework that equips an MLLM with the ability to (i)
decide \emph{when} additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine
\emph{where} to ground within the image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the
relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved chain-of-thought. The core
of our method is \textbf{Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization
(R-GRPO)}, a training paradigm that rewards the model for selecting informative
regions, formulating appropriate transformations (e.g.\ crop, zoom), and
integrating the resulting visual context into subsequent reasoning steps. To
bootstrap this policy, we compile a modest but carefully curated Visuo-Lingual
Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus that provides step-level supervision on
region selection and textual justification. Extensive experiments on MathVista,
ScienceQA, and other benchmarks show that VLM-R$^3$ sets a new state of the art
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with the largest gains appearing on
questions demanding subtle spatial reasoning or fine-grained visual cue
extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MedVQA中模态偏好偏差问题，提升临床诊断效率。

Method: 提出MedCFVQA模型，利用因果图消除模态偏好偏差，并重构数据集以改变问题和答案的先验依赖。

Result: 在SLAKE、RadVQA及其重构数据集上表现显著优于非因果模型。

Conclusion: MedCFVQA有效解决了模态偏好偏差问题，提升了MedVQA的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is crucial for enhancing the
efficiency of clinical diagnosis by providing accurate and timely responses to
clinicians' inquiries regarding medical images. Existing MedVQA models suffered
from modality preference bias, where predictions are heavily dominated by one
modality while overlooking the other (in MedVQA, usually questions dominate the
answer but images are overlooked), thereby failing to learn multimodal
knowledge. To overcome the modality preference bias, we proposed a Medical
CounterFactual VQA (MedCFVQA) model, which trains with bias and leverages
causal graphs to eliminate the modality preference bias during inference.
Existing MedVQA datasets exhibit substantial prior dependencies between
questions and answers, which results in acceptable performance even if the
model significantly suffers from the modality preference bias. To address this
issue, we reconstructed new datasets by leveraging existing MedVQA datasets and
Changed their P3rior dependencies (CP) between questions and their answers in
the training and test set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MedCFVQA
significantly outperforms its non-causal counterpart on both SLAKE, RadVQA and
SLAKE-CP, RadVQA-CP datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全身摄影系统在自动检测和分析可疑皮肤病变方面仍有改进空间，尤其是图像分辨率和清晰度。

Method: 系统结合深度和RGB摄像头，利用3D身体形状估计和聚焦表面优化方法，选择每个相机姿态的最佳对焦距离。

Result: 系统在模拟数据和实际扫描中分别达到0.068 mm/像素和0.0566 mm/像素的平均分辨率，85%和95%的表面区域清晰对焦。

Conclusion: 该系统的高保真成像能力有望提升皮肤病变的自动化分析效果，助力皮肤癌筛查。

Abstract: Total Body Photography (TBP) is becoming a useful screening tool for patients
at high risk for skin cancer. While much progress has been made, existing TBP
systems can be further improved for automatic detection and analysis of
suspicious skin lesions, which is in part related to the resolution and
sharpness of acquired images. This paper proposes a novel shape-aware TBP
system automatically capturing full-body images while optimizing image quality
in terms of resolution and sharpness over the body surface. The system uses
depth and RGB cameras mounted on a 360-degree rotary beam, along with 3D body
shape estimation and an in-focus surface optimization method to select the
optimal focus distance for each camera pose. This allows for optimizing the
focused coverage over the complex 3D geometry of the human body given the
calibrated camera poses. We evaluate the effectiveness of the system in
capturing high-fidelity body images. The proposed system achieves an average
resolution of 0.068 mm/pixel and 0.0566 mm/pixel with approximately 85% and 95%
of surface area in-focus, evaluated on simulation data of diverse body shapes
and poses as well as a real scan of a mannequin respectively. Furthermore, the
proposed shape-aware focus method outperforms existing focus protocols (e.g.
auto-focus). We believe the high-fidelity imaging enabled by the proposed
system will improve automated skin lesion analysis for skin cancer screening.

Motivation: 放射科医生在生成CT报告时耗时且易错，现有VQA系统难以处理CT图像的解剖复杂性和跨切片空间关系。

Method: CT-Agent采用解剖独立工具分解复杂性，并通过全局-局部标记压缩策略捕捉跨切片空间关系。

Result: 在两个3D胸部CT数据集（CT-RATE和RadGenome-ChestCT）上的实验验证了CT-Agent的优越性能。

Conclusion: CT-Agent为解决CTQA任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which produces 3D volumetric medical data that
can be viewed as hundreds of cross-sectional images (a.k.a. slices), provides
detailed anatomical information for diagnosis. For radiologists, creating CT
radiology reports is time-consuming and error-prone. A visual question
answering (VQA) system that can answer radiologists' questions about some
anatomical regions on the CT scan and even automatically generate a radiology
report is urgently needed. However, existing VQA systems cannot adequately
handle the CT radiology question answering (CTQA) task for: (1) anatomic
complexity makes CT images difficult to understand; (2) spatial relationship
across hundreds slices is difficult to capture. To address these issues, this
paper proposes CT-Agent, a multimodal agentic framework for CTQA. CT-Agent
adopts anatomically independent tools to break down the anatomic complexity;
furthermore, it efficiently captures the across-slice spatial relationship with
a global-local token compression strategy. Experimental results on two 3D chest
CT datasets, CT-RATE and RadGenome-ChestCT, verify the superior performance of
CT-Agent.

TL;DR: DOVE是一种高效的一步扩散模型，用于真实世界视频超分辨率（VSR），通过微调预训练视频扩散模型实现，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在VSR中表现优异，但推理速度慢；单步采样技术虽能加速，但在VSR中实现仍有挑战。

Method: 提出DOVE模型，采用潜在像素训练策略和两阶段方案，结合高质量数据集HQ-VSR进行微调。

Result: DOVE性能与多步扩散方法相当或更优，推理速度提升28倍。

Conclusion: DOVE在性能和效率上均表现出色，为VSR任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated promising performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the dozens of sampling steps they require,
make inference extremely slow. Sampling acceleration techniques, particularly
single-step, provide a potential solution. Nonetheless, achieving one step in
VSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and
stringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an
efficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by
fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (*i.e.*, CogVideoX). To
effectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The
strategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video
super-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to
construct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning
on this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive
experiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to
multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference
efficiency, achieving up to a **28$\times$** speed-up over existing methods
such as MGLD-VSR. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/DOVE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于Swin Transformer的模型，用于在RGB、YCbCr和HSV三种颜色空间中区分计算机生成图像（CGI）和真实数字图像。模型在多个数据集上表现出色，RGB颜色空间效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类方法在处理CGI的复杂性和多样性方面存在局限，需要更准确的区分方法。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer的分层架构捕获局部和全局特征，结合数据增强和t-SNE可视化技术。

Result: RGB颜色空间表现最佳，模型在跨数据集测试中表现出鲁棒性和领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: Swin Transformer模型在数字图像取证中具有潜力，尤其在区分CGI和自然图像方面表现优异。

Abstract: This study aims to address the growing challenge of distinguishing
computer-generated imagery (CGI) from authentic digital images across three
different color spaces; RGB, YCbCr, and HSV. Given the limitations of existing
classification methods in handling the complexity and variability of CGI, this
research proposes a Swin Transformer based model for accurate differentiation
between natural and synthetic images. The proposed model leverages the Swin
Transformer's hierarchical architecture to capture local and global features
for distinguishing CGI from natural images. Its performance was assessed
through intra- and inter-dataset testing across three datasets: CiFAKE, JSSSTU,
and Columbia. The model was evaluated individually on each dataset (D1, D2, D3)
and on the combined datasets (D1+D2+D3) to test its robustness and domain
generalization. To address dataset imbalance, data augmentation techniques were
applied. Additionally, t-SNE visualization was used to demonstrate the feature
separability achieved by the Swin Transformer across the selected color spaces.
The model's performance was tested across all color schemes, with the RGB color
scheme yielding the highest accuracy for each dataset. As a result, RGB was
selected for domain generalization analysis and compared with other CNN-based
models, VGG-19 and ResNet-50. The comparative results demonstrate the proposed
model's effectiveness in detecting CGI, highlighting its robustness and
reliability in both intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluations. The findings
of this study highlight the Swin Transformer model's potential as an advanced
tool for digital image forensics, particularly in distinguishing CGI from
natural images. The model's strong performance indicates its capability for
domain generalization, making it a valuable asset in scenarios requiring
precise and reliable image classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的线检测方法虽然精度高，但推理速度慢且需要在大数据集上预训练注意力机制，限制了其在低延迟视频分析中的应用。

Method: 提出Deformable Line Attention（DLA）机制，无需预训练注意力机制，并开发了基于DLA的Transformer方法LINEA。

Result: 实验表明，LINEA在速度上显著提升，并在分布外数据集测试中优于先前模型的sAP指标。

Conclusion: LINEA通过DLA机制解决了Transformer方法的速度和预训练需求问题，为线检测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Line detection is a basic digital image processing operation used by
higher-level processing methods. Recently, transformer-based methods for line
detection have proven to be more accurate than methods based on CNNs, at the
expense of significantly lower inference speeds. As a result, video analysis
methods that require low latencies cannot benefit from current
transformer-based methods for line detection. In addition, current
transformer-based models require pretraining attention mechanisms on large
datasets (e.g., COCO or Object360). This paper develops a new transformer-based
method that is significantly faster without requiring pretraining the attention
mechanism on large datasets. We eliminate the need to pre-train the attention
mechanism using a new mechanism, Deformable Line Attention (DLA). We use the
term LINEA to refer to our new transformer-based method based on DLA. Extensive
experiments show that LINEA is significantly faster and outperforms previous
models on sAP in out-of-distribution dataset testing.

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要高效处理多视角数据和复杂场景，尤其是罕见驾驶行为。MoE在LLMs中的成功表明参数专业化具有强扩展性，因此将其应用于自动驾驶。

Method: DriveMoE基于Drive-π0框架，增加了视觉MoE（动态选择摄像头）和动作MoE（激活不同驾驶行为的专家模块），模拟人类驾驶的注意力机制。

Result: 在Bench2Drive闭环评估中，DriveMoE实现了SOTA性能，证明了视觉和动作MoE结合的有效性。

Conclusion: DriveMoE通过专业化参数设计解决了现有模型的模式平均问题，为自动驾驶任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) demands effective processing of
multi-view sensory data and robust handling of diverse and complex driving
scenarios, particularly rare maneuvers such as aggressive turns. Recent success
of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In
this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a
Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is
built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from
the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE
to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to
the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition,
where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than
exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE
by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different
driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able
to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like
existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness
of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release
our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.

Conclusion: 强化学习在训练多轮视觉语言GUI代理处理复杂UI交互方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents for controlling
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a unique challenge to optimize
long-horizon action sequences with multimodal feedback from complex
environments. While recent works have advanced multi-turn reinforcement
learning (RL) for reasoning and tool-using capabilities in LLMs, their
application to GUI-based agents remains relatively underexplored due to the
difficulty of sparse rewards, delayed feedback, and high rollout costs. In this
paper, we investigate end-to-end policy optimization for vision-language-based
GUI agents with the aim of improving performance on complex, long-horizon
computer tasks. We propose Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO), an
end-to-end RL approach that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with a replay buffer to reuse the successful experience across training
iterations. To further stabilize the training process, we propose a task
selection strategy that filters tasks based on baseline agent performance,
allowing the agent to focus on learning from informative interactions.
Additionally, we compare ARPO with offline preference optimization approaches,
highlighting the advantages of policy-based methods in GUI environments.
Experiments on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that ARPO achieves competitive
results, establishing a new performance baseline for LLM-based GUI agents
trained via reinforcement learning. Our findings underscore the effectiveness
of reinforcement learning for training multi-turn, vision-language GUI agents
capable of managing complex real-world UI interactions. Codes and

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，EPCL-JUDA优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: EPCL-JUDA通过增强原型表达能力和优化伪标签，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Recently, prototype learning has emerged in semi-supervised medical image
segmentation and achieved remarkable performance. However, the scarcity of
labeled data limits the expressiveness of prototypes in previous methods,
potentially hindering the complete representation of prototypes for class
embedding. To overcome this issue, we propose an efficient prototype
consistency learning via joint uncertainty quantification and data augmentation
(EPCL-JUDA) to enhance the semantic expression of prototypes based on the
framework of Mean-Teacher. The concatenation of original and augmented labeled
data is fed into student network to generate expressive prototypes. Then, a
joint uncertainty quantification method is devised to optimize pseudo-labels
and generate reliable prototypes for original and augmented unlabeled data
separately. High-quality global prototypes for each class are formed by fusing
labeled and unlabeled prototypes, which are utilized to generate
prototype-to-features to conduct consistency learning. Notably, a prototype
network is proposed to reduce high memory requirements brought by the
introduction of augmented data. Extensive experiments on Left Atrium,
Pancreas-NIH, Type B Aortic Dissection datasets demonstrate EPCL-JUDA's
superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the
effectiveness of our framework. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有弱监督目标检测方法在多类分类任务中存在分类模糊性，且未能充分利用其独特优势。

Method: 提出自分类增强模块（ICBC）和自分类校正算法，结合多类分类任务，提升检测性能。

Result: 在VOC 2007和2012数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了分类模糊性问题，提升了弱监督目标检测的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted much
attention due to its low labeling cost. The success of recent WSOD models is
often ascribed to the two-stage multi-class classification (MCC) task, i.e.,
multiple instance learning and online classification refinement. Despite
achieving non-trivial progresses, these methods overlook potential
classification ambiguities between these two MCC tasks and fail to leverage
their unique strengths. In this work, we introduce a novel WSOD framework to
ameliorate these two issues. For one thing, we propose a self-classification
enhancement module that integrates intra-class binary classification (ICBC) to
bridge the gap between the two distinct MCC tasks. The ICBC task enhances the
network's discrimination between positive and mis-located samples in a
class-wise manner and forges a mutually reinforcing relationship with the MCC
task. For another, we propose a self-classification correction algorithm during
inference, which combines the results of both MCC tasks to effectively reduce
the mis-classified predictions. Extensive experiments on the prevalent VOC 2007
& 2012 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.

Abstract: To address the challenge of complex pathological feature extraction in
automated cardiac MRI segmentation, this study proposes an innovative
dual-encoder architecture named SAMba-UNet. The framework achieves cross-modal
feature collaborative learning by integrating the vision foundation model SAM2,
the state-space model Mamba, and the classical UNet. To mitigate domain
discrepancies between medical and natural images, a Dynamic Feature Fusion
Refiner is designed, which enhances small lesion feature extraction through
multi-scale pooling and a dual-path calibration mechanism across channel and
spatial dimensions. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Omni-Attention Convergence
Module (HOACM) is introduced, combining global contextual attention with
branch-selective emphasis mechanisms to effectively fuse SAM2's local
positional semantics and Mamba's long-range dependency modeling capabilities.
Experiments on the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.9103 and an HD95 boundary error of 1.0859 mm,
significantly outperforming existing methods, particularly in boundary
localization for complex pathological structures such as right ventricular
anomalies. This work provides an efficient and reliable solution for automated
cardiac disease diagnosis, and the code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Image to image translation is an active area of research in the field of
computer vision, enabling the generation of new images with different styles,
textures, or resolutions while preserving their characteristic properties.
Recent architectures leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
transform input images from one domain to another. In this work, we focus on
the study of both paired and unpaired image translation across multiple image
domains. For the paired task, we used a conditional GAN model, and for the
unpaired task, we trained it using cycle consistency loss. We experimented with
different types of loss functions, multiple Patch-GAN sizes, and model
architectures. New quantitative metrics - precision, recall, and FID score -
were used for analysis. In addition, a qualitative study of the results of
different experiments was conducted.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TEA的新型对抗攻击方法，利用目标图像的边缘信息生成对抗样本，显著减少了查询次数，并在低查询设置下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法主要依赖决策边界的几何特性，忽略了图像本身的信息，导致在目标攻击中效果不佳。

Method: TEA方法通过利用目标图像的边缘信息，生成更接近源图像但仍能实现目标分类的对抗样本。

Result: TEA在低查询设置下显著优于现有方法（减少近70%的查询），并为几何攻击提供了更好的初始化。

Conclusion: TEA通过结合图像边缘信息，有效提升了黑盒对抗攻击的性能和效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to
adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce
misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is
accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific
target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions.
Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the
decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than
incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose
Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge
information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an
adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the
desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly
70\% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world
applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by
efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved
target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

Abstract: This paper reports on the NTIRE 2025 challenge on Text to Image (T2I)
generation model quality assessment, which will be held in conjunction with the
New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement Workshop (NTIRE) at CVPR 2025.
The aim of this challenge is to address the fine-grained quality assessment of
text-to-image generation models. This challenge evaluates text-to-image models
from two aspects: image-text alignment and image structural distortion
detection, and is divided into the alignment track and the structural track.
The alignment track uses the EvalMuse-40K, which contains around 40K
AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) generated by 20 popular generative models. The
alignment track has a total of 371 registered participants. A total of 1,883
submissions are received in the development phase, and 507 submissions are
received in the test phase. Finally, 12 participating teams submitted their
models and fact sheets. The structure track uses the EvalMuse-Structure, which
contains 10,000 AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) with corresponding structural
distortion mask. A total of 211 participants have registered in the structure
track. A total of 1155 submissions are received in the development phase, and
487 submissions are received in the test phase. Finally, 8 participating teams
submitted their models and fact sheets. Almost all methods have achieved better
results than baseline methods, and the winning methods in both tracks have
demonstrated superior prediction performance on T2I model quality assessment.

Conclusion: SuperPure显著提升了对抗补丁攻击的鲁棒性和效率，适用于实时网络物理系统。

Abstract: As vision-based machine learning models are increasingly integrated into
autonomous and cyber-physical systems, concerns about (physical) adversarial
patch attacks are growing. While state-of-the-art defenses can achieve
certified robustness with minimal impact on utility against highly-concentrated
localized patch attacks, they fall short in two important areas: (i)
State-of-the-art methods are vulnerable to low-noise distributed patches where
perturbations are subtly dispersed to evade detection or masking, as shown
recently by the DorPatch attack; (ii) Achieving high robustness with
state-of-the-art methods is extremely time and resource-consuming, rendering
them impractical for latency-sensitive applications in many cyber-physical
systems.
  To address both robustness and latency issues, this paper proposes a new
defense strategy for adversarial patch attacks called SuperPure. The key
novelty is developing a pixel-wise masking scheme that is robust against both
distributed and localized patches. The masking involves leveraging a GAN-based
super-resolution scheme to gradually purify the image from adversarial patches.
Our extensive evaluations using ImageNet and two standard classifiers, ResNet
and EfficientNet, show that SuperPure advances the state-of-the-art in three
major directions: (i) it improves the robustness against conventional localized
patches by more than 20%, on average, while also improving top-1 clean accuracy
by almost 10%; (ii) It achieves 58% robustness against distributed patch
attacks (as opposed to 0% in state-of-the-art method, PatchCleanser); (iii) It
decreases the defense end-to-end latency by over 98% compared to PatchCleanser.
Our further analysis shows that SuperPure is robust against white-box attacks
and different patch sizes. Our code is open-source.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级即插即用的运动提示跟踪方法，通过结合运动和视觉线索提升跟踪鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器主要依赖视觉区分性，忽视了视频数据的时间一致性。

Method: 设计了运动编码器、融合解码器和自适应权重机制，将长期运动轨迹编码到视觉嵌入空间。

Result: 在七个挑战性跟踪基准上显著提升了视觉跟踪器的鲁棒性，且训练成本和速度牺牲极小。

Conclusion: 运动提示模块能有效提升现有视觉跟踪器的性能，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Due to the challenges of processing temporal information, most trackers
depend solely on visual discriminability and overlook the unique temporal
coherence of video data. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and
plug-and-play motion prompt tracking method. It can be easily integrated into
existing vision-based trackers to build a joint tracking framework leveraging
both motion and vision cues, thereby achieving robust tracking through
efficient prompt learning. A motion encoder with three different positional
encodings is proposed to encode the long-term motion trajectory into the visual
embedding space, while a fusion decoder and an adaptive weight mechanism are
designed to dynamically fuse visual and motion features. We integrate our
motion module into three different trackers with five models in total.
Experiments on seven challenging tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed motion module significantly improves the robustness of vision-based
trackers, with minimal training costs and negligible speed sacrifice. Code is
available at https://github.com/zj5559/Motion-Prompt-Tracking.

Result: 实验表明，TensorAR显著提升了自回归模型的生成性能。

Conclusion: TensorAR作为一种即插即用模块，为自回归图像生成提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generators offer a language-model-friendly approach
to image generation by predicting discrete image tokens in a causal sequence.
However, unlike diffusion models, AR models lack a mechanism to refine previous
predictions, limiting their generation quality. In this paper, we introduce
TensorAR, a new AR paradigm that reformulates image generation from next-token
prediction to next-tensor prediction. By generating overlapping windows of
image patches (tensors) in a sliding fashion, TensorAR enables iterative
refinement of previously generated content. To prevent information leakage
during training, we propose a discrete tensor noising scheme, which perturbs
input tokens via codebook-indexed noise. TensorAR is implemented as a
plug-and-play module compatible with existing AR models. Extensive experiments
on LlamaGEN, Open-MAGVIT2, and RAR demonstrate that TensorAR significantly
improves the generation performance of autoregressive models.

Method: 提出PancapEngine生成高质量数据，PancapChain分阶段生成全景描述。

Result: PancapChain-13B超越InternVL-2.5-78B、GPT-4o和Gemini-2.0-Pro等模型。

Conclusion: PancapEngine和PancapChain有效提升了全景描述任务的性能，并贡献了评估指标和测试集。

Abstract: This work introduces panoptic captioning, a novel task striving to seek the
minimum text equivalence of images. We take the first step towards panoptic
captioning by formulating it as a task of generating a comprehensive textual
description for an image, which encapsulates all entities, their respective
locations and attributes, relationships among entities, as well as global image
state.Through an extensive evaluation, our work reveals that state-of-the-art
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have limited performance in solving
panoptic captioning. To address this, we propose an effective data engine named
PancapEngine to produce high-quality data and a novel method named PancapChain
to improve panoptic captioning. Specifically, our PancapEngine first detects
diverse categories of entities in images by an elaborate detection suite, and
then generates required panoptic captions using entity-aware prompts.
Additionally, our PancapChain explicitly decouples the challenging panoptic
captioning task into multiple stages and generates panoptic captions step by
step. More importantly, we contribute a comprehensive metric named PancapScore
and a human-curated test set for reliable model evaluation.Experiments show
that our PancapChain-13B model can beat state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs like
InternVL-2.5-78B and even surpass proprietary models like GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.0-Pro, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data engine and method.

TL;DR: FPQVAR是一种高效的浮点量化框架，用于优化视觉自回归模型（VAR），通过算法和硬件协同设计显著提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在图像生成中表现优异，但参数和计算成本高，难以在边缘设备上部署。FPQVAR旨在降低内存和计算成本。

Method: 提出双格式量化、组级Hadamard变换和GHT感知可学习变换，解决输入激活不平衡和时间变化异常通道问题；设计低比特浮点量化器和乘法器，并实现FPGA加速器。

Result: 4位量化下FID从10.83降至3.58，IS从175.9提升至241.5；6位量化性能接近FP16模型；FPGA加速器吞吐量达1.1图像/秒，能效提升显著。

Conclusion: FPQVAR通过算法和硬件协同设计，显著提升了VAR模型的效率和性能，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling has marked a paradigm shift in image
generation from next-token prediction to next-scale prediction. VAR predicts a
set of tokens at each step from coarse to fine scale, leading to better image
quality and faster inference speed compared to existing diffusion models.
However, the large parameter size and computation cost hinder its deployment on
edge devices. To reduce the memory and computation cost, we propose FPQVAR, an
efficient post-training floating-point (FP) quantization framework for VAR
featuring algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithm level, we first
identify the challenges of quantizing VAR. To address them, we propose Dual
Format Quantization for the highly imbalanced input activation. We further
propose Group-wise Hadamard Transformation and GHT-Aware Learnable
Transformation to address the time-varying outlier channels. At the hardware
level, we design the first low-bit FP quantizer and multiplier with lookup
tables on FPGA and propose the first FPGA-based VAR accelerator featuring
low-bit FP computation and an elaborate two-level pipeline. Extensive
experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our
proposed FPQVAR significantly improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from
10.83 to 3.58, Inception Score (IS) from 175.9 to 241.5 under 4-bit
quantization. FPQVAR also significantly improves the performance of 6-bit
quantized VAR, bringing it on par with the FP16 model. Our accelerator on
AMD-Xilinx VCK190 FPGA achieves a throughput of 1.1 image/s, which is 3.1x
higher than the integer-based accelerator. It also demonstrates 3.6x and 2.8x
higher energy efficiency compared to the integer-based accelerator and GPU
baseline, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate classification of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images is
essential for diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer. In this study, we
investigate the utility of a dermatology-specific foundation model, PanDerm, in
comparison with two Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures (ViT base and Swin
Transformer V2 base) for the task of skin lesion classification. Using frozen
features extracted from PanDerm, we apply non-linear probing with three
different classifiers, namely, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, and
TabNet. For the ViT-based models, we perform full fine-tuning to optimize
classification performance. Our experiments on the HAM10000 and MSKCC datasets
demonstrate that the PanDerm-based MLP model performs comparably to the
fine-tuned Swin transformer model, while fusion of PanDerm and Swin Transformer
predictions leads to further performance improvements. Future work will explore
additional foundation models, fine-tuning strategies, and advanced fusion
techniques.

Conclusion: 类感知的扩散风格迁移方法能有效利用少量目标域数据提升模型性能，推动鲁棒感知系统在真实场景中的应用。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly
on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions
where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate
realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such
diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on
synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent
style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance
Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective
attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization
selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters
cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in
regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style
characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence,
unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without
constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target
domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID
scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware
diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain
gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems
for challenging real-world applications. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 微表情因其短暂和高度局部化的特性难以准确识别，现有方法的准确率仅为50%。因此，需要探索多模态融合技术以提升动态微表情识别的性能。

Method: 提出TSFmicro框架，整合Retention Network和Transformer网络，通过并行时空融合方法在高维特征空间融合时空信息。

Result: 实验表明，TSFmicro在三个知名微表情数据集上优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: TSFmicro通过高效的时空特征融合，显著提升了微表情识别的准确性和语义丰富性。

Abstract: When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed
through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a
genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the
transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant
challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of
micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In
order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of
dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques,
with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal
features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion
framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network
(RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient
micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and
spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion
method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal
information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary
"where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic
information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary
state-of-the-art methods. This is evidenced by its effectiveness on three
well-recognised micro-expression datasets.

Result: 在基准数据集上，计算量减少47%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeCafNet在效率和性能上均达到新高度。

Abstract: Long Video Temporal Grounding (LVTG) aims at identifying specific moments
within lengthy videos based on user-provided text queries for effective content
retrieval. The approach taken by existing methods of dividing video into clips
and processing each clip via a full-scale expert encoder is challenging to
scale due to prohibitive computational costs of processing a large number of
clips in long videos. To address this issue, we introduce DeCafNet, an approach
employing ``delegate-and-conquer'' strategy to achieve computation efficiency
without sacrificing grounding performance. DeCafNet introduces a sidekick
encoder that performs dense feature extraction over all video clips in a
resource-efficient manner, while generating a saliency map to identify the most
relevant clips for full processing by the expert encoder. To effectively
leverage features from sidekick and expert encoders that exist at different
temporal resolutions, we introduce DeCaf-Grounder, which unifies and refines
them via query-aware temporal aggregation and multi-scale temporal refinement
for accurate grounding. Experiments on two LTVG benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DeCafNet reduces computation by up to 47\% while still outperforming
existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for LTVG in terms of both
efficiency and performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有视线估计方法仅能预测视线方向或屏幕上的注视点，无法提供全面的6-DoF视线信息，且个体差异影响方法的泛化能力。

Method: 提出MAGE架构，结合方向与位置特征，通过多任务解码器预测6-DoF视线信息，并设计Easy-Calibration模块，利用个体数据高效校准模型。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze、EYEDIAP和IMRGaze数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MAGE方法在6-DoF视线估计中表现优异，且通过校准模块有效应对个体差异，适用于真实人机交互场景。

Abstract: Eye gaze can provide rich information on human psychological activities, and
has garnered significant attention in the field of Human-Robot Interaction
(HRI). However, existing gaze estimation methods merely predict either the gaze
direction or the Point-of-Gaze (PoG) on the screen, failing to provide
sufficient information for a comprehensive six Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) gaze
analysis in 3D space. Moreover, the variations of eye shape and structure among
individuals also impede the generalization capability of these methods. In this
study, we propose MAGE, a Multi-task Architecture for Gaze Estimation with an
efficient calibration module, to predict the 6-DoF gaze information that is
applicable for the real-word HRI. Our basic model encodes both the directional
and positional features from facial images, and predicts gaze results with
dedicated information flow and multiple decoders. To reduce the impact of
individual variations, we propose a novel calibration module, namely
Easy-Calibration, to fine-tune the basic model with subject-specific data,
which is efficient to implement without the need of a screen. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the public MPIIFaceGaze, EYEDIAP, and our built IMRGaze datasets.

Abstract: Bounding box supervision has gained considerable attention in weakly
supervised 3D instance segmentation. While this approach alleviates the need
for extensive point-level annotations, obtaining accurate bounding boxes in
practical applications remains challenging. To this end, we explore the
inaccurate bounding box, named sketchy bounding box, which is imitated through
perturbing ground truth bounding box by adding scaling, translation, and
rotation. In this paper, we propose Sketchy-3DIS, a novel weakly 3D instance
segmentation framework, which jointly learns pseudo labeler and segmentator to
improve the performance under the sketchy bounding-box supervisions.
Specifically, we first propose an adaptive box-to-point pseudo labeler that
adaptively learns to assign points located in the overlapped parts between two
sketchy bounding boxes to the correct instance, resulting in compact and pure
pseudo instance labels. Then, we present a coarse-to-fine instance segmentator
that first predicts coarse instances from the entire point cloud and then
learns fine instances based on the region of coarse instances. Finally, by
using the pseudo instance labels to supervise the instance segmentator, we can
gradually generate high-quality instances through joint training. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
the ScanNetV2 and S3DIS benchmarks, and even outperforms several fully
supervised methods using sketchy bounding boxes. Code is available at

Motivation: 深度学习感知方法易受对抗样本攻击，导致安全问题，需在物理世界中生成有效对抗样本并评估检测系统。

Method: 提出联合对抗训练框架，结合非刚性表面建模和真实3D匹配机制，生成对抗纹理。

Result: 实验表明，生成的对抗纹理能有效误导目标检测模型，并在多角度、光照变化和距离变化下表现鲁棒性和迁移性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are typical complex intelligent systems with artificial
intelligence at their core. However, perception methods based on deep learning
are extremely vulnerable to adversarial samples, resulting in safety accidents.
How to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world and
evaluate object detection systems is a huge challenge. In this study, we
propose a unified joint adversarial training framework for both 2D and 3D
samples to address the challenges of intra-class diversity and environmental
variations in real-world scenarios. Building upon this framework, we introduce
an adversarial sample reality enhancement approach that incorporates non-rigid
surface modeling and a realistic 3D matching mechanism. We compare with 5
advanced adversarial patches and evaluate their attack performance on 8 object
detecotrs, including single-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based models.
Extensive experiment results in digital and physical environments demonstrate
that the adversarial textures generated by our method can effectively mislead
the target detection model. Moreover, proposed method demonstrates excellent
robustness and transferability under multi-angle attacks, varying lighting
conditions, and different distance in the physical world. The demo video and

TL;DR: SPIN是一种任务无关的注意力引导头部抑制策略，用于减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉现象，同时不增加计算或延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成文本时经常出现与视觉上下文不符的幻觉现象，现有方法在减少幻觉时会显著增加延迟。

Method: 通过分析发现幻觉与特定注意力头相关，SPIN选择性地抑制对图像令牌注意力低的注意力头，保留前K个注意力头。

Result: 在视觉问答和图像描述任务中，SPIN将幻觉分数降低至2.7倍，保持F1分数，并将吞吐量提高1.8倍。

Conclusion: SPIN是一种高效且无需额外计算开销的方法，能显著减少LVLM中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large
vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating
texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing
hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase
in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided
head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference,
without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate
whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our
analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of
attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query
token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to
image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations
on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the
efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining
F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives. Code is

Motivation: 解决现有AI人脸识别系统在姿态不变人脸识别中的挑战，特别是侧面人脸与正面人脸的匹配问题。

Method: 1. 提出FSPFM模块，将任意角度的侧面图像转换为正面图像；2. 设计新的训练范式，包括预训练和注意力引导的微调阶段。

Result: 在五大人脸识别基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且在标准场景中保持优异性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在姿态不变人脸识别任务中具有显著优势，并在其他场景中表现卓越。

Abstract: Pose-invariant face recognition has become a challenging problem for modern
AI-based face recognition systems. It aims at matching a profile face captured
in the wild with a frontal face registered in a database. Existing methods
perform face frontalization via either generative models or learning a pose
robust feature representation. In this paper, a new method is presented to
perform face frontalization and recognition within the feature space. First, a
novel feature space pose frontalization module (FSPFM) is proposed to transform
profile images with arbitrary angles into frontal counterparts. Second, a new
training paradigm is proposed to maximize the potential of FSPFM and boost its
performance. The latter consists of a pre-training and an attention-guided
fine-tuning stage. Moreover, extensive experiments have been conducted on five
popular face recognition benchmarks. Results show that not only our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art in the pose-invariant face recognition task
but also maintains superior performance in other standard scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Circle-RoPE，一种新的位置编码方案，解决视觉语言模型中跨模态位置偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE在视觉语言模型中引入跨模态位置偏差，导致图像和文本之间的虚假对齐。

Method: 提出Per-Token Distance (PTD)量化跨模态位置独立性，并设计Circle-RoPE方案，将图像标记映射到与文本标记正交的圆形轨迹上。

Result: 实验表明，Circle-RoPE有效减少跨模态偏差，同时保留图像空间信息。

Conclusion: Circle-RoPE为视觉语言模型提供了更鲁棒和灵活的位置编码框架。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding
relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when
extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), its variants introduce
unintended cross-modal positional biases. Specifically, they enforce relative
positional dependencies between text token indices and image tokens, causing
spurious alignments. This issue arises because image tokens representing the
same content but located at different spatial positions are assigned distinct
positional biases, leading to inconsistent cross-modal associations. To address
this, we propose Per-Token Distance (PTD) - a simple yet effective metric for
quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities.
Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme
that maps image token indices onto a circular trajectory orthogonal to the
linear path of text token indices, forming a cone-like structure. This
configuration ensures that each text token maintains an equal distance to all
image tokens, reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving
intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a
staggered layer strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers.
This design leverages the complementary strengths of each RoPE variant, thereby
enhancing the model's overall performance. Our experimental results demonstrate
that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while
reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible
positional encoding framework for LVLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究人类如何获取物体内部表征的机制尚不明确，深度学习模型为此提供了研究工具。论文旨在比较人类与模型在细粒度和粗粒度表征上的相似性。

Method: 采用基于Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的无监督对齐方法，比较人类与模型在1,854个物体上的表征相似性。

Result: CLIP模型在细粒度和粗粒度层面均与人类表征高度匹配，而自监督模型仅能捕捉粗粒度结构。

Conclusion: 语言信息对获取精确物体表征至关重要，自监督学习在捕捉粗粒度结构上具有潜力。

Abstract: The learning mechanisms by which humans acquire internal representations of
objects are not fully understood. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a
useful tool for investigating this question, as they have internal
representations similar to those of humans as a byproduct of optimizing their
objective functions. While previous studies have shown that models trained with
various learning paradigms - such as supervised, self-supervised, and CLIP -
acquire human-like representations, it remains unclear whether their similarity
to human representations is primarily at a coarse category level or extends to
finer details. Here, we employ an unsupervised alignment method based on
Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to compare human and model object
representations at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. The unique
feature of this method compared to conventional representational similarity
analysis is that it estimates optimal fine-grained mappings between the
representation of each object in human and model representations. We used this
unsupervised alignment method to assess the extent to which the representation
of each object in humans is correctly mapped to the corresponding
representation of the same object in models. Using human similarity judgments
of 1,854 objects from the THINGS dataset, we find that models trained with CLIP
consistently achieve strong fine- and coarse-grained matching with human object
representations. In contrast, self-supervised models showed limited matching at
both fine- and coarse-grained levels, but still formed object clusters that
reflected human coarse category structure. Our results offer new insights into
the role of linguistic information in acquiring precise object representations
and the potential of self-supervised learning to capture coarse categorical
structures.

Conclusion: FPWC通过全局规划和代码执行显著提升了自动控制的效率和效果。

Abstract: The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently
performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these
tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information
available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result,
current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on
immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address
this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven
Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language
understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global
understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable
\emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are
subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model,
executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in
simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative
improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the
simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“排名熵最小化”的方法，用于解决测试时自适应中的模型崩溃问题，并扩展其适用于连续场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时自适应在现实环境中在线学习时，熵最小化因其高效性和适应性成为主要策略，但在连续测试时自适应中稳定性不足，易导致模型崩溃。

Method: 通过渐进掩码策略明确结构化预测难度，逐步对齐模型在不同预测难度下的概率分布，同时保持熵的排名顺序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中广泛评估，实证结果证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 排名熵最小化方法有效缓解了熵最小化的稳定性问题，适用于连续测试时自适应场景。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to adapt to realistic environments in an online
manner by learning during test time. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
principal strategy for test-time adaptation due to its efficiency and
adaptability. Nevertheless, it remains underexplored in continual test-time
adaptation, where stability is more important. We observe that the entropy
minimization method often suffers from model collapse, where the model
converges to predicting a single class for all images due to a trivial
solution. We propose ranked entropy minimization to mitigate the stability
problem of the entropy minimization method and extend its applicability to
continuous scenarios. Our approach explicitly structures the prediction
difficulty through a progressive masking strategy. Specifically, it gradually
aligns the model's probability distributions across different levels of
prediction difficulty while preserving the rank order of entropy. The proposed
method is extensively evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through empirical results. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小目标检测在复杂环境中存在挑战，主要源于检测器难以学习小目标的判别性特征，以及训练过程中高质量小目标样本的选择困难。

Method: MAFE R-CNN包含两个关键组件：多线索样本选择（MCSS）策略和类别感知特征增强机制（CFEM）。MCSS利用IoU距离、预测类别置信度和真实区域大小作为样本选择的线索；CFEM通过类别感知记忆模块增强目标特征表示。

Result: 在大规模小目标数据集SODA上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MAFE R-CNN通过改进样本选择和特征增强，显著提升了小目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Small object detection in intricate environments has consistently represented
a major challenge in the field of object detection. In this paper, we identify
that this difficulty stems from the detectors' inability to effectively learn
discriminative features for objects of small size, compounded by the complexity
of selecting high-quality small object samples during training, which motivates
the proposal of the Multi-Clue Assignment and Feature Enhancement
R-CNN.Specifically, MAFE R-CNN integrates two pivotal components.The first is
the Multi-Clue Sample Selection (MCSS) strategy, in which the Intersection over
Union (IoU) distance, predicted category confidence, and ground truth region
sizes are leveraged as informative clues in the sample selection process. This
methodology facilitates the selection of diverse positive samples and ensures a
balanced distribution of object sizes during training, thereby promoting
effective model learning.The second is the Category-aware Feature Enhancement
Mechanism (CFEM), where we propose a simple yet effective category-aware memory
module to explore the relationships among object features. Subsequently, we
enhance the object feature representation by facilitating the interaction
between category-aware features and candidate box features.Comprehensive
experiments conducted on the large-scale small object dataset SODA validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该模型为心脏功能的全面评估提供了一种高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for
the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most
commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors
such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load
conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac
dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart
failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a
relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility
is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with
myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac
function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from
cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain
calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential
frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are
often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac
function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and
segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep
GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view
cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with
conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that
the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation
time.

Conclusion: MAGIC提供了一种无需监督或模型调优的物理一致动态生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in static 3D generation have intensified the demand for
physically consistent dynamic 3D content. However, existing video generation
models, including diffusion-based methods, often prioritize visual realism
while neglecting physical plausibility, resulting in implausible object
dynamics. Prior approaches for physics-aware dynamic generation typically rely
on large-scale annotated datasets or extensive model fine-tuning, which imposes
significant computational and data collection burdens and limits scalability
across scenarios. To address these challenges, we present MAGIC, a
training-free framework for single-image physical property inference and
dynamic generation, integrating pretrained image-to-video diffusion models with
iterative LLM-based reasoning. Our framework generates motion-rich videos from
a static image and closes the visual-to-physical gap through a
confidence-driven LLM feedback loop that adaptively steers the diffusion model
toward physics-relevant motion. To translate visual dynamics into controllable
physical behavior, we further introduce a differentiable MPM simulator
operating directly on 3D Gaussians reconstructed from the single image,
enabling physically grounded, simulation-ready outputs without any supervision
or model tuning. Experiments show that MAGIC outperforms existing physics-aware
generative methods in inference accuracy and achieves greater temporal
coherence than state-of-the-art video diffusion models.

Motivation: 解决ViTs因全局自注意力机制导致的高计算复杂度问题，同时聚焦关键信息区域。

Method: 使用锚点标记学习关键信息，通过二分注意力估计降低复杂度，并利用马尔可夫过程近似全局自注意力。

Result: 在分类、检测和分割任务中表现优异，如ImageNet分类准确率提升9.0%，FLOPs减少46.7%。

Conclusion: AnchorFormer显著提升了ViTs的效率和性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on
vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches.
Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image
with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly
gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for
the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based
efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to
learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by
estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the
complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where
$m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with
the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiable learn these distributions
and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. Moreover, we
extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification,
detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of
our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs
reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under
comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.

Result: 在机器人视频预测和科学时空预测实验中，ForeDiff显著提升预测准确性和样本一致性。

Conclusion: ForeDiff为扩散模型在世界建模中的应用提供了新方向，解决了条件理解和去噪耦合的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based models have enabled significant progress in
generation tasks across various modalities and have recently found applications
in world modeling. However, unlike typical generation tasks that encourage
sample diversity, world models entail different sources of uncertainty and
require consistent samples aligned with the ground-truth trajectory, which is a
limitation we empirically observe in diffusion models. We argue that a key
bottleneck in learning consistent diffusion-based world models lies in the
suboptimal predictive ability, which we attribute to the entanglement of
condition understanding and target denoising within shared architectures and
co-training schemes. To address this, we propose Foresight Diffusion
(ForeDiff), a diffusion-based world modeling framework that enhances
consistency by decoupling condition understanding from target denoising.
ForeDiff incorporates a separate deterministic predictive stream to process
conditioning inputs independently of the denoising stream, and further
leverages a pretrained predictor to extract informative representations that
guide generation. Extensive experiments on robot video prediction and
scientific spatiotemporal forecasting show that ForeDiff improves both
predictive accuracy and sample consistency over strong baselines, offering a
promising direction for diffusion-based world models.

Abstract: Restoring nighttime images affected by multiple adverse weather conditions is
a practical yet under-explored research problem, as multiple weather conditions
often coexist in the real world alongside various lighting effects at night.
This paper first explores the challenging multi-weather nighttime image
restoration task, where various types of weather degradations are intertwined
with flare effects. To support the research, we contribute the AllWeatherNight
dataset, featuring large-scale high-quality nighttime images with diverse
compositional degradations, synthesized using our introduced illumination-aware
degradation generation. Moreover, we present ClearNight, a unified nighttime
image restoration framework, which effectively removes complex degradations in
one go. Specifically, ClearNight extracts Retinex-based dual priors and
explicitly guides the network to focus on uneven illumination regions and

identifies weather degradations and adaptively selects optimal candidate units
associated with specific weather types. Our ClearNight achieves

*Yao Wei,Muhammad Usman,Hazrat Bilal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为InspectionV3的自动化烟草分级解决方案，利用定制化的深度卷积神经网络，解决了烟草加工中的效率和质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烟草加工中存在效率低下、质量不一致等问题，传统方法成本高且不可靠，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用定制化的深度卷积神经网络架构，结合预处理和标注的数据集（21,113张图像，20个质量等级），并通过多层CNN和批量归一化处理烟草特性。

Result: 系统实现了97%的准确率，95%的精确率和召回率，96%的F1分数和AUC，95%的特异性，验证了其实际可行性。

Conclusion: InspectionV3能够高效、准确地自动化烟草分级，提升工作流程并支持数据驱动的决策。

Abstract: The problems that tobacco workshops encounter include poor curing,
inconsistencies in supplies, irregular scheduling, and a lack of oversight, all
of which drive up expenses and worse quality. Large quantities make manual
examination costly, sluggish, and unreliable. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently made strides in capabilities that transcend those of
conventional methods. To effectively enhance them, nevertheless, extensive
customization is needed to account for subtle variations in tobacco grade. This
study introduces InspectionV3, an integrated solution for automated flue-cured
tobacco grading that makes use of a customized deep convolutional neural
network architecture. A scope that covers color, maturity, and curing
subtleties is established via a labelled dataset consisting of 21,113 images
spanning 20 quality classes. Expert annotators performed preprocessing on the
tobacco leaf images, including cleaning, labelling, and augmentation.
Multi-layer CNN factors use batch normalization to describe domain properties
like as permeability and moisture spots, and so account for the subtleties of
the workshop. Its expertise lies in converting visual patterns into useful
information for enhancing workflow. Fast notifications are made possible by
real-time, on-the-spot grading that matches human expertise. Images-powered
analytics dashboards facilitate the tracking of yield projections, inventories,
bottlenecks, and the optimization of data-driven choices. More labelled images
are assimilated after further retraining, improving representational capacities
and enabling adaptations for seasonal variability. Metrics demonstrate 97%
accuracy, 95% precision and recall, 96% F1-score and AUC, 95% specificity;
validating real-world viability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM的固定标记表示限制了其在复杂视觉任务中的表现，无法像人类一样动态分配注意力。

Method: 提出ALTo，包含标记长度预测器、长度正则化项和可微分标记分块策略，并集成到ALToLLM中，通过GRPO优化掩码质量与效率的权衡。

Result: ALToLLM在主流分割基准测试中达到最优性能，且自适应标记成本。

Conclusion: ALTo通过动态标记长度显著提升了MLLM在视觉任务中的表现，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: While humans effortlessly draw visual objects and shapes by adaptively
allocating attention based on their complexity, existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) remain constrained by rigid token representations.
Bridging this gap, we propose ALTo, an adaptive length tokenizer for
autoregressive mask generation. To achieve this, a novel token length predictor
is designed, along with a length regularization term and a differentiable token
chunking strategy. We further build ALToLLM that seamlessly integrates ALTo
into MLLM. Preferences on the trade-offs between mask quality and efficiency is
implemented by group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Experiments
demonstrate that ALToLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance with adaptive
token cost on popular segmentation benchmarks. Code and models are released at

TL;DR: 论文提出DigiFakeAV数据集和DigiShield检测方法，以应对扩散模型生成的高度逼真数字人视频的检测挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的数字人视频高度逼真且隐蔽，现有检测方法难以应对，亟需新数据集和检测技术。

Method: 构建DigiFakeAV数据集（60,000视频），并提出DigiShield检测方法，结合时空和跨模态特征分析。

Result: 用户研究表明伪造视频混淆率达68%，DigiShield在DigiFakeAV和DF-TIMIT数据集上表现最优。

Conclusion: DigiShield通过细粒度分析有效识别伪造视频，为数字人伪造检测提供了新基准。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deepfake technology has given rise
to an emerging and serious threat to public security: diffusion model-based
digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such
models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency through multimodal
control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to
existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the
first large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion
models. Employing five latest digital human generation methods (Sonic, Hallo,
etc.) and voice cloning method, we systematically produce a dataset comprising
60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin
tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data
diversity and realism. User studies show that the confusion rate between forged
and real videos reaches 68%, and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection
models exhibit large drops in AUC values on DigiFakeAV, highlighting the
challenge of the dataset. To address this problem, we further propose
DigiShield, a detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal
fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the
semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves SOTA performance on
both the DigiFakeAV and DF-TIMIT datasets. Experiments show that this method
effectively identifies covert artifacts through fine-grained analysis of the
temporal evolution of facial features in synthetic videos.

TL;DR: 本文研究了光学识别技术在塑料自动分拣中的应用，发现其在现实场景中效果有限，主要依赖颜色和形状等物理特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 塑料回收率低（仅8%），主要因污染、经济激励不足和技术难题。自动分拣是关键，光学识别技术被广泛应用，但其在真实场景中的效果需进一步验证。

Method: 通过收集20,000多张图像数据集，使用公共和自定义机器学习管道评估光学识别能力，并利用Grad-CAM、显著性图和混淆矩阵分析模型行为。

Result: 光学识别方法在真实MRF场景中对塑料分拣的准确性有限，因其依赖颜色和形状等物理特性。

Conclusion: 光学识别技术在塑料自动分拣中效果有限，需进一步改进以应对现实挑战。

Abstract: According to the EPA, only 25% of waste is recycled, and just 60% of U.S.
municipalities offer curbside recycling. Plastics fare worse, with a recycling
rate of only 8%; an additional 16% is incinerated, while the remaining 76% ends
up in landfills. The low plastic recycling rate stems from contamination, poor
economic incentives, and technical difficulties, making efficient recycling a
challenge. To improve recovery, automated sorting plays a critical role.
Companies like AMP Robotics and Greyparrot utilize optical systems for sorting,
while Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) employ Near-Infrared (NIR) sensors
to detect plastic types.
  Modern optical sorting uses advances in computer vision such as object
recognition and instance segmentation, powered by machine learning. Two-stage
detectors like Mask R-CNN use region proposals and classification with deep
backbones like ResNet. Single-stage detectors like YOLO handle detection in one
pass, trading some accuracy for speed. While such methods excel under ideal
conditions with a large volume of labeled training data, challenges arise in
realistic scenarios, emphasizing the need to further examine the efficacy of
optic detection for automated sorting.
  In this study, we compiled novel datasets totaling 20,000+ images from varied
sources. Using both public and custom machine learning pipelines, we assessed
the capabilities and limitations of optical recognition for sorting. Grad-CAM,
saliency maps, and confusion matrices were employed to interpret model
behavior. We perform this analysis on our custom trained models from the
compiled datasets. To conclude, our findings are that optic recognition methods
have limited success in accurate sorting of real-world plastics at MRFs,
primarily because they rely on physical properties such as color and shape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有测试时适应方法在高方差任务中优化不稳定和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 使用低维指纹和键值码本表示模型，通过岭杠杆得分计算合并系数。

Result: 在nuScenes-C上NDS提升14.9%，nuScenes-to-KITTI上mAP提升7.6%。

Conclusion: CodeMerge高效且性能优越，适用于下游任务且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Maintaining robust 3D perception under dynamic and unpredictable test-time
conditions remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems.
Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks
like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While
recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer
improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are
computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple
forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and
scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating
in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents
each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source
model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute
merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints,
enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality.
Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving
end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by
over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as
online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training. Code and
pretrained models are released in the supplementary material.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS)的新框架，通过关键点驱动的运动表示减少动态场景重建的存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线自由视点视频（FVV）重建方法因逐点建模导致存储需求过高，无法充分利用运动特性。

Method: 利用运动局部性和一致性，通过关键点驱动的运动表示建模对象一致的高斯点运动，仅传输关键点属性以减少存储。具体包括：1) 使用视空间梯度差异策略识别运动区域中的稀疏关键点；2) 提出自适应运动驱动机制预测空间影响场，传播关键点运动；3) 采用错误感知校正策略选择性优化关键帧重建。

Result: ComGS实现了显著的存储减少（相比3DGStream减少159倍，相比QUEEN减少14倍），同时保持视觉保真度和渲染速度。

Conclusion: ComGS为动态场景重建提供了一种高效存储的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a high-fidelity and efficient
paradigm for online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction, offering viewers
rapid responsiveness and immersive experiences. However, existing online
methods face challenge in prohibitive storage requirements primarily due to
point-wise modeling that fails to exploit the motion properties. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS)
framework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene,
that models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven
motion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this
framework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first
identify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion
regions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these
keypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a
spatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian
points with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction
strategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous
regions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall,
ComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to
3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining
competitive visual fidelity and rendering speed. Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态3D场景重建中时空表示效率低、运动建模复杂以及渲染质量不足的问题。

Method: 使用三平面变形场编码4D场景，通过SH注意力机制改进渲染效率，并引入潜在扩散模块增强时间一致性。

Result: 在合成基准测试中表现优异，视觉质量、时间一致性和稀疏视图输入鲁棒性均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的时空表示和生成模块，显著提升了动态场景重建的性能。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction that
integrates three key components: an explicit tri-plane deformation field, a
view-conditioned canonical radiance field with spherical harmonics (SH)
attention, and a temporally-aware latent diffusion prior. Our method encodes 4D
scenes using three orthogonal 2D feature planes that evolve over time, enabling
efficient and compact spatiotemporal representation. These features are
explicitly warped into a canonical space via a deformation offset field,
eliminating the need for MLP-based motion modeling.
  In canonical space, we replace traditional MLP decoders with a structured
SH-based rendering head that synthesizes view-dependent color via attention
over learned frequency bands improving both interpretability and rendering
efficiency. To further enhance fidelity and temporal consistency, we introduce
a transformer-guided latent diffusion module that refines the tri-plane and
deformation features in a compressed latent space. This generative module
denoises scene representations under ambiguous or out-of-distribution (OOD)
motion, improving generalization.
  Our model is trained in two stages: the diffusion module is first pre-trained
independently, and then fine-tuned jointly with the full pipeline using a
combination of image reconstruction, diffusion denoising, and temporal
consistency losses. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on synthetic
benchmarks, surpassing recent methods such as HexPlane and 4D Gaussian
Splatting in visual quality, temporal coherence, and robustness to sparse-view
dynamic inputs.

TL;DR: TextureSAM通过纹理增强技术改进SAM模型，在纹理主导的场景中表现优于原模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在语义分割中偏向形状而非纹理，而纹理在医学影像等领域至关重要。

Method: 采用纹理增强技术微调模型，并使用纹理修改的ADE20K数据集训练TextureSAM。

Result: TextureSAM在自然和合成纹理数据集上分别比SAM-2提高0.2和0.18 mIoU。

Conclusion: TextureSAM有效解决了SAM的纹理偏见，适用于纹理主导的任务。

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) have achieved remarkable success in object
segmentation tasks across diverse datasets. However, these models are
predominantly trained on large-scale semantic segmentation datasets, which
introduce a bias toward object shape rather than texture cues in the image.
This limitation is critical in domains such as medical imaging, material
classification, and remote sensing, where texture changes define object
boundaries. In this study, we investigate SAM's bias toward semantics over
textures and introduce a new texture-aware foundation model, TextureSAM, which
performs superior segmentation in texture-dominant scenarios. To achieve this,
we employ a novel fine-tuning approach that incorporates texture augmentation
techniques, incrementally modifying training images to emphasize texture
features. By leveraging a novel texture-alternation of the ADE20K dataset, we
guide TextureSAM to prioritize texture-defined regions, thereby mitigating the
inherent shape bias present in the original SAM model. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that TextureSAM significantly outperforms SAM-2 on both
natural (+0.2 mIoU) and synthetic (+0.18 mIoU) texture-based segmentation
datasets. The code and texture-augmented dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) includes diverse tasks, from bone to organ
segmentation, each with its own challenges in finding the best segmentation
model. The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many
aspects of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters
and heuristic design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose
Auto-nnU-Net, a novel nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization
(HPO), neural architecture search (NAS), and hierarchical NAS (HNAS).
Additionally, we propose Regularized PriorBand to balance model accuracy with
the computational resources required for training, addressing the resource
constraints often faced in real-world medical settings that limit the
feasibility of extensive training procedures. We evaluate our approach across
diverse MIS datasets from the well-established Medical Segmentation Decathlon,
analyzing the impact of AutoML techniques on segmentation performance,
computational efficiency, and model design choices. The results demonstrate
that our AutoML approach substantially improves the segmentation performance of
nnU-Net on 6 out of 10 datasets and is on par on the other datasets while
maintaining practical resource requirements. Our code is available at

Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model to utilize the input left video, the warped

high-quality right camera view. In order to effectively exploit information
from neighboring frames for inpainting, we modify the attention layers in SVD
to compute full attention for discoccluded pixels. Our model is trained to
generate the right view video in an end-to-end manner by minimizing image space
losses to ensure high-quality generation. Our approach outperforms previous

Abstract: Video captioning models have seen notable advancements in recent years,
especially with regard to their ability to capture temporal information. While
many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as
temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how
models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature
extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We
propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the
temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based
system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion
from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our
findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only
front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions,
specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to
improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In
conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based
caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively
addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current
state-of-the-art model architectures.

Motivation: 传统四角位置偏移参数化缺乏几何可解释性且需要解线性系统，本文旨在提出一种更直观且高效的单应性参数化方法。

Method: 利用相似-核-相似（SKS）分解，将单应性解耦为相似变换和核变换两组独立参数，并推导核变换参数与角度偏移的线性关系。

Result: 提出的参数化方法通过矩阵乘法直接估计单应性，性能与四角位置偏移方法相当。

Conclusion: 该几何参数化方法不仅具有更好的可解释性，还简化了计算过程，适用于深度单应性估计。

Abstract: Planar homography, with eight degrees of freedom (DOFs), is fundamental in
numerous computer vision tasks. While the positional offsets of four corners
are widely adopted (especially in neural network predictions), this
parameterization lacks geometric interpretability and typically requires
solving a linear system to compute the homography matrix. This paper presents a
novel geometric parameterization of homographies, leveraging the
similarity-kernel-similarity (SKS) decomposition for projective
transformations. Two independent sets of four geometric parameters are
decoupled: one for a similarity transformation and the other for the kernel
transformation. Additionally, the geometric interpretation linearly relating
the four kernel transformation parameters to angular offsets is derived. Our
proposed parameterization allows for direct homography estimation through
matrix multiplication, eliminating the need for solving a linear system, and
achieves performance comparable to the four-corner positional offsets in deep
homography estimation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在视角不稳定、自遮挡和噪声运动下的局限性，以及预定义3D对象先验和抽象文本提示导致的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 采用双层架构：高层使用视觉语言模型和深度估计器推断运动先验，低层使用DiT-based流匹配策略生成细粒度轨迹。通过数据集整理范式统一数据。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，手腕平移误差降低86.9%，关节旋转误差降低34.1%。

Conclusion: MEgoHand能够准确建模手部关节结构，并在多样化场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Egocentric hand-object motion generation is crucial for immersive AR/VR and
robotic imitation but remains challenging due to unstable viewpoints,
self-occlusions, perspective distortion, and noisy ego-motion. Existing methods
rely on predefined 3D object priors, limiting generalization to novel objects,
which restricts their generalizability to novel objects. Meanwhile, recent
multimodal approaches suffer from ambiguous generation from abstract textual
cues, intricate pipelines for modeling 3D hand-object correlation, and
compounding errors in open-loop prediction. We propose MEgoHand, a multimodal
framework that synthesizes physically plausible hand-object interactions from
egocentric RGB, text, and initial hand pose. MEgoHand introduces a bi-level
architecture: a high-level "cerebrum" leverages a vision language model (VLM)
to infer motion priors from visual-textual context and a monocular depth
estimator for object-agnostic spatial reasoning, while a low-level DiT-based
flow-matching policy generates fine-grained trajectories with temporal
orthogonal filtering to enhance stability. To address dataset inconsistency, we
design a dataset curation paradigm with an Inverse MANO Retargeting Network and
Virtual RGB-D Renderer, curating a unified dataset of 3.35M RGB-D frames, 24K
interactions, and 1.2K objects. Extensive experiments across five in-domain and
two cross-domain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MEgoHand, achieving
substantial reductions in wrist translation error (86.9%) and joint rotation
error (34.1%), highlighting its capacity to accurately model fine-grained hand
joint structures and generalize robustly across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Chest X-ray (CXR) Visual Question Answering
(VQA), addressing both single-image image-difference questions. Single-image
questions focus on abnormalities within a specific CXR ("What abnormalities are
seen in image X?"), while image-difference questions compare two longitudinal
CXRs acquired at different time points ("What are the differences between image
X and Y?"). We further explore how the integration of radiology reports can
enhance the performance of VQA models. While previous approaches have
demonstrated the utility of radiology reports during the pre-training phase, we
extend this idea by showing that the reports can also be leveraged as
additional input to improve the VQA model's predicted answers. First, we
propose a unified method that handles both types of questions and
auto-regressively generates the answers. For single-image questions, the model
is provided with a single CXR. For image-difference questions, the model is
provided with two CXRs from the same patient, captured at different time
points, enabling the model to detect and describe temporal changes. Taking
inspiration from 'Chain-of-Thought reasoning', we demonstrate that performance
on the CXR VQA task can be improved by grounding the answer generator module
with a radiology report predicted for the same CXR. In our approach, the VQA
model is divided into two steps: i) Report Generation (RG) and ii) Answer
Generation (AG). Our results demonstrate that incorporating predicted radiology
reports as evidence to the AG model enhances performance on both single-image
and image-difference questions, achieving state-of-the-art results on the
Medical-Diff-VQA dataset.

TL;DR: CVBM框架通过背景建模提升前景分割性能，双向一致性机制确保预测对齐，实验显示在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督医学图像分割方法忽视背景建模的潜力，研究表明背景建模能增强前景建模的置信度。

Method: 提出CVBM框架，结合背景建模作为辅助视角，并引入双向一致性机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，如胰腺数据集上仅用20%标注数据即优于全监督方法。

Conclusion: CVBM通过背景建模和双向一致性机制显著提升半监督医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) leverages unlabeled data
to reduce reliance on manually annotated images. However, current SOTA
approaches predominantly focus on foreground-oriented modeling (i.e.,
segmenting only the foreground region) and have largely overlooked the
potential benefits of explicitly modeling the background region. Our study
theoretically and empirically demonstrates that highly certain predictions in
background modeling enhance the confidence of corresponding foreground
modeling. Building on this insight, we propose the Cross-view Bidirectional
Modeling (CVBM) framework, which introduces a novel perspective by
incorporating background modeling to improve foreground modeling performance.
Within CVBM, background modeling serves as an auxiliary perspective, providing
complementary supervisory signals to enhance the confidence of the foreground
model. Additionally, CVBM introduces an innovative bidirectional consistency
mechanism, which ensures mutual alignment between foreground predictions and
background-guided predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves SOTA performance on the LA, Pancreas, ACDC, and HRF datasets.
Notably, on the Pancreas dataset, CVBM outperforms fully supervised methods
(i.e., DSC: 84.57% vs. 83.89%) while utilizing only 20% of the labeled data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种纹理无关的方法，用于估计和跟踪多只鸽子的3D关节位置，扩展了现有3D-MuPPET框架，通过分割生成轮廓并估计2D关键点，最终推断3D姿态。


<details>

Motivation: 解决纹理依赖性问题，提高3D姿态估计的通用性和鲁棒性。

Method: 基于3D-MuPPET框架，使用分割方法生成个体轮廓，估计2D关键点并三角化为3D姿态，匹配和跟踪身份。

Result: 纹理无关方法达到与纹理依赖方法相当的精度，并初步验证了在其他鸟类上的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为纹理无关的姿态估计框架提供了基础，并展示了跨物种应用的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a texture-independent approach to estimate and
track 3D joint positions of multiple pigeons. For this purpose, we build upon
the existing 3D-MuPPET framework, which estimates and tracks the 3D poses of up
to 10 pigeons using a multi-view camera setup. We extend this framework by
using a segmentation method that generates silhouettes of the individuals,
which are then used to estimate 2D keypoints. Following 3D-MuPPET, these 2D
keypoints are triangulated to infer 3D poses, and identities are matched in the
first frame and tracked in 2D across subsequent frames. Our proposed
texture-independent approach achieves comparable accuracy to the original
texture-dependent 3D-MuPPET framework. Additionally, we explore our approach's
applicability to other bird species. To do that, we infer the 2D joint
positions of four bird species without additional fine-tuning the model trained
on pigeons and obtain preliminary promising results. Thus, we think that our
approach serves as a solid foundation and inspires the development of more
robust and accurate texture-independent pose estimation frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLM的安全性尚未被充分研究，而现有研究表明视频模态会显著降低模型的安全性，因此需要系统性研究和解决方案。

Method: 提出了VideoSafety-R1框架，包括Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning（AT-SFT）和Safety-Guided GRPO技术，通过多任务目标和动态策略优化提升安全性。

Result: VideoSafety-R1在VSB-Eval-HH上提升了65.1%，在其他图像安全数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: 视频模态对LLM安全性有显著负面影响，但通过双阶段框架可以有效缓解这一问题，为视频LLM的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: While the safety risks of image-based large language models have been
extensively studied, their video-based counterparts (Video LLMs) remain
critically under-examined. To systematically study this problem, we introduce
\textbf{VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) - the first large-scale, culturally diverse
benchmark for Video LLM safety}, which compromises 77,646 video-query pairs and
spans 19 principal risk categories across 10 language communities. \textit{We
reveal that integrating video modality degrades safety performance by an
average of 42.3\%, exposing systemic risks in multimodal attack exploitation.}
To address this vulnerability, we propose \textbf{VideoSafety-R1}, a dual-stage
framework achieving unprecedented safety gains through two innovations: (1)
Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) injects learnable alarm tokens
into visual and textual sequences, enabling explicit harm perception across
modalities via multitask objectives. (2) Then, Safety-Guided GRPO enhances
defensive reasoning through dynamic policy optimization with rule-based rewards
derived from dual-modality verification. These components synergize to shift
safety alignment from passive harm recognition to active reasoning. The
resulting framework achieves a 65.1\% improvement on VSB-Eval-HH, and improves
by 59.1\%, 44.3\%, and 15.0\% on the image safety datasets MMBench, VLGuard,
and FigStep, respectively. \textit{Our codes are available in the supplementary

Method: 使用MedMultiPoints数据集，将任务转化为指令提示，并通过LoRA方法微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: 多任务训练提高了模型的鲁棒性和准确性，但也存在边缘案例可靠性下降的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究表明通用VLMs可通过提示驱动的微调适应医学任务，为可解释和多功能医学AI提供了潜力。

Abstract: We investigate fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-task
medical image understanding, focusing on detection, localization, and counting
of findings in medical images. Our objective is to evaluate whether
instruction-tuned VLMs can simultaneously improve these tasks, with the goal of
enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Using MedMultiPoints, a
multimodal dataset with annotations from endoscopy (polyps and instruments) and
microscopy (sperm cells), we reformulate each task into instruction-based
prompts suitable for vision-language reasoning. We fine-tune
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across multiple task
combinations. Results show that multi-task training improves robustness and
accuracy. For example, it reduces the Count Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
increases Matching Accuracy in the Counting + Pointing task. However,
trade-offs emerge, such as more zero-case point predictions, indicating reduced
reliability in edge cases despite overall performance gains. Our study
highlights the potential of adapting general-purpose VLMs to specialized
medical tasks via prompt-driven fine-tuning. This approach mirrors clinical
workflows, where radiologists simultaneously localize, count, and describe
findings - demonstrating how VLMs can learn composite diagnostic reasoning
patterns. The model produces interpretable, structured outputs, offering a
promising step toward explainable and versatile medical AI. Code, model
weights, and scripts will be released for reproducibility at

Furthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having
different computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an
image-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact
summary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The
proposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the
need for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised

Result: FarSight在图像和视频基准测试中显著减少了幻觉现象，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: FarSight是一种通用且高效的解码策略，能够显著改善多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they
often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized
into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We
argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the
token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding
strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information
propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient
interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens,
overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene
in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context
inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play
decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely
by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token
propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper
triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to
capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness
encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model
to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks.
With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant
hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and
video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的高光谱全色锐化方法，通过轻量级神经网络动态调整权重，确保所有波段的均匀光谱质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱全色锐化面临独特挑战，如波段数量多、噪声大、光谱不匹配等，现有方法难以在所有波段保持一致性。

Method: 使用动态调整权重的轻量级神经网络，通过滞后动态调整空间损失，重新定义空间损失以考虑非线性依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在最新基准工具箱上表现优异，所有波段均保持一致的锐化质量。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部数据训练，灵活且低复杂度，解决了高光谱全色锐化的关键问题。

Abstract: Hyperspectral pansharpening has received much attention in recent years due
to technological and methodological advances that open the door to new
application scenarios. However, research on this topic is only now gaining
momentum. The most popular methods are still borrowed from the more mature
field of multispectral pansharpening and often overlook the unique challenges
posed by hyperspectral data fusion, such as i) the very large number of bands,
ii) the overwhelming noise in selected spectral ranges, iii) the significant
spectral mismatch between panchromatic and hyperspectral components, iv) a
typically high resolution ratio. Imprecise data modeling especially affects
spectral fidelity. Even state-of-the-art methods perform well in certain
spectral ranges and much worse in others, failing to ensure consistent quality
across all bands, with the risk of generating unreliable results. Here, we
propose a hyperspectral pansharpening method that explicitly addresses this
problem and ensures uniform spectral quality. To this end, a single lightweight
neural network is used, with weights that adapt on the fly to each band. During
fine-tuning, the spatial loss is turned on and off to ensure a fast convergence
of the spectral loss to the desired level, according to a hysteresis-like
dynamic. Furthermore, the spatial loss itself is appropriately redefined to
account for nonlinear dependencies between panchromatic and spectral bands.
Overall, the proposed method is fully unsupervised, with no prior training on
external data, flexible, and low-complexity. Experiments on a recently
published benchmarking toolbox show that it ensures excellent sharpening
quality, competitive with the state-of-the-art, consistently across all bands.

<details>

Motivation: 医学异常检测因数据隐私和稀缺性受限，现有方法多忽略多类别异常区分。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SD-MAD在多类别医学异常检测中表现优异，解决了少样本场景下的挑战。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is crucial for early clinical intervention,
yet it faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality medical imaging
data, caused by privacy concerns and data silos. Few-shot learning has emerged
as a promising approach to alleviate these limitations by leveraging the
large-scale prior knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs). Recent
advancements in few-shot medical AD have treated normal and abnormal cases as a
one-class classification problem, often overlooking the distinction among
multiple anomaly categories. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework
tailored for few-shot medical anomaly detection in the scenario where the
identification of multiple anomaly categories is required. To capture the
detailed radiological signs of medical anomaly categories, our framework
incorporates diverse textual descriptions for each category generated by a
Large-Language model, under the assumption that different anomalies in medical
images may share common radiological signs in each category. Specifically, we
introduce SD-MAD, a two-stage Sign-Driven few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection
framework: (i) Radiological signs are aligned with anomaly categories by
amplifying inter-anomaly discrepancy; (ii) Aligned signs are selected further
to mitigate the effect of the under-fitting and uncertain-sample issue caused
by limited medical data, employing an automatic sign selection strategy at
inference. Moreover, we propose three protocols to comprehensively quantify the
performance of multi-anomaly detection. Extensive experiments illustrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: Share-GRPO有效提升了MLLMs的推理能力，并解决了RL中的关键问题。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to incentivize the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) and develop an
effective approach that mitigates the sparse reward and advantage vanishing
issues during RL. To this end, we propose Share-GRPO, a novel RL approach that
tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories
over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the
question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and
then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over
the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories
across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares
reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution
advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more
accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of
policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning
benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be
available at https://github.com/HJYao00/R1-ShareVL.

Abstract: Batteries are essential for various applications, including electric vehicles
and renewable energy storage, making safety and efficiency critical concerns.
Anomaly detection in battery thermal images helps identify failures early, but
traditional deep learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is
difficult to obtain, especially for anomalies due to safety risks and high data
collection costs. To overcome this, we explore zero-shot anomaly detection
using Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, which leverage pretrained
knowledge and textbased prompts to generalize across vision tasks. By
incorporating prior knowledge of normal battery thermal behavior, we design
prompts to detect anomalies without battery-specific training data. We evaluate
three VQA models (ChatGPT-4o, LLaVa-13b, and BLIP-2) analyzing their robustness
to prompt variations, repeated trials, and qualitative outputs. Despite the
lack of finetuning on battery data, our approach demonstrates competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art models that are trained with the
battery data. Our findings highlight the potential of VQA-based zero-shot
learning for battery anomaly detection and suggest future directions for
improving its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D对象压缩方法在高压缩率下表现不佳，导致纹理伪影、多边形数量减少和网格间隙等问题。语义压缩通过直接操作核心概念，解决了这些问题。

Method: 构建了一个基于公开生成模型的3D语义压缩流程，利用深度生成模型预测缺失信息，并使用自然语言作为存储格式。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上实现了高达105倍的压缩率，并在100倍压缩率附近的质量保持区域优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 语义压缩在高压缩率下表现优异，适用于大规模协作项目，尤其是在增强和虚拟现实应用中。

Abstract: Traditional methods for 3D object compression operate only on structural
information within the object vertices, polygons, and textures. These methods
are effective at compression rates up to 10x for standard object sizes but
quickly deteriorate at higher compression rates with texture artifacts,
low-polygon counts, and mesh gaps. In contrast, semantic compression ignores
structural information and operates directly on the core concepts to push to
extreme levels of compression. In addition, it uses natural language as its
storage format, which makes it natively human-readable and a natural fit for
emerging applications built around large-scale, collaborative projects within
augmented and virtual reality. It deprioritizes structural information like
location, size, and orientation and predicts the missing information with
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In this work, we construct a pipeline
for 3D semantic compression from public generative models and explore the
quality-compression frontier for 3D object compression. We apply this pipeline
to achieve rates as high as 105x for 3D objects taken from the Objaverse
dataset and show that semantic compression can outperform traditional methods
in the important quality-preserving region around 100x compression.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is subject to complex and dynamic processes, ranging from
large-scale phenomena such as tectonic plate movements to localized changes
associated with ecosystems, agriculture, or human activity. Satellite images
enable global monitoring of these processes with extensive spatial and temporal
coverage, offering advantages over in-situ methods. In particular, resulting
satellite image time series (SITS) datasets contain valuable information. To
handle their large volume and complexity, some recent works focus on the use of
graph-based techniques that abandon the regular Euclidean structure of
satellite data to work at an object level. Besides, graphs enable modelling
spatial and temporal interactions between identified objects, which are crucial
for pattern detection, classification and regression tasks. This paper is an
effort to examine the integration of graph-based methods in spatio-temporal
remote-sensing analysis. In particular, it aims to present a versatile
graph-based pipeline to tackle SITS analysis. It focuses on the construction of
spatio-temporal graphs from SITS and their application to downstream tasks. The
paper includes a comprehensive review and two case studies, which highlight the
potential of graph-based approaches for land cover mapping and water resource
forecasting. It also discusses numerous perspectives to resolve current
limitations and encourage future developments.

Conclusion: 一步扩散在生成压缩中是可行的，OneDC在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: While recent diffusion-based generative image codecs have shown impressive
performance, their iterative sampling process introduces unpleasing latency. In
this work, we revisit the design of a diffusion-based codec and argue that
multi-step sampling is not necessary for generative compression. Based on this
insight, we propose OneDC, a One-step Diffusion-based generative image Codec --
that integrates a latent compression module with a one-step diffusion
generator. Recognizing the critical role of semantic guidance in one-step
diffusion, we propose using the hyperprior as a semantic signal, overcoming the
limitations of text prompts in representing complex visual content. To further
enhance the semantic capability of the hyperprior, we introduce a semantic
distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from a pretrained generative
tokenizer to the hyperprior codec. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid pixel- and
latent-domain optimization to jointly enhance both reconstruction fidelity and
perceptual realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneDC achieves SOTA
perceptual quality even with one-step generation, offering over 40% bitrate
reduction and 20x faster decoding compared to prior multi-step diffusion-based
codecs. Code will be released later.

Method: 提出KRIS-Bench基准，包含22个任务和1,267个标注实例，引入知识合理性指标。

Result: 测试10个先进模型，发现推理能力存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 需要知识为中心的基准以推动智能图像编辑系统发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have enabled significant
progress in instruction-based image editing. However, while these models
produce visually plausible outputs, their capacity for knowledge-based
reasoning editing tasks remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce
KRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed
lens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks
across three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural.
Based on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning
dimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To
support fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that
incorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints
and calibrated through human studies. Empirical results on 10 state-of-the-art
models reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need
for knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent
image editing systems.

*Kai Hsiang Hsieh,Monyneath Yim,Jui Chiu Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEDD-PCC是一种端到端的学习框架，联合压缩点云的几何和属性，通过单一编码器和双解码器设计提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将几何和属性编码分开处理，增加了计算复杂度且未充分利用共享特征。

Method: 采用单一编码器提取共享特征到统一潜在空间，双解码器顺序重建几何和属性，并引入知识蒸馏。

Result: 在规则和基于学习的方法中表现优异，证明了其高效性。

Conclusion: SEDD-PCC是一种简单有效的AI驱动压缩方法。

Abstract: To encode point clouds containing both geometry and attributes, most
learning-based compression schemes treat geometry and attribute coding
separately, employing distinct encoders and decoders. This not only increases
computational complexity but also fails to fully exploit shared features
between geometry and attributes. To address this limitation, we propose
SEDD-PCC, an end-to-end learning-based framework for lossy point cloud
compression that jointly compresses geometry and attributes. SEDD-PCC employs a
single encoder to extract shared geometric and attribute features into a
unified latent space, followed by dual specialized decoders that sequentially
reconstruct geometry and attributes. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge
distillation to enhance feature representation learning from a teacher model,
further improving coding efficiency. With its simple yet effective design,
SEDD-PCC provides an efficient and practical solution for point cloud
compression. Comparative evaluations against both rule-based and learning-based
methods demonstrate its competitive performance, highlighting SEDD-PCC as a
promising AI-driven compression approach.

Motivation: 现有预训练模型在3D网格生成中存在数据偏差和低质量结果，而全局强化学习方法难以捕捉局部结构细节。

Method: 采用M-DPO进行局部细化，结合边界边缘比（BER）和拓扑分数（TS）的拓扑感知评分系统。

Result: 实验显示，Mesh-RFT将Hausdorff距离（HD）降低了24.6%，拓扑分数（TS）提升了3.8%，优于全局DPO方法。

Conclusion: Mesh-RFT在几何完整性和拓扑规则性上实现了新的最优性能，适用于生产级网格生成。

Abstract: Existing pretrained models for 3D mesh generation often suffer from data
biases and produce low-quality results, while global reinforcement learning
(RL) methods rely on object-level rewards that struggle to capture local
structure details. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{Mesh-RFT}, a
novel fine-grained reinforcement fine-tuning framework that employs Masked
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable localized refinement via
quality-aware face masking. To facilitate efficient quality evaluation, we
introduce an objective topology-aware scoring system to evaluate geometric
integrity and topological regularity at both object and face levels through two
metrics: Boundary Edge Ratio (BER) and Topology Score (TS). By integrating
these metrics into a fine-grained RL strategy, Mesh-RFT becomes the first
method to optimize mesh quality at the granularity of individual faces,
resolving localized errors while preserving global coherence. Experiment
results show that our M-DPO approach reduces Hausdorff Distance (HD) by 24.6\%
and improves Topology Score (TS) by 3.8\% over pre-trained models, while
outperforming global DPO methods with a 17.4\% HD reduction and 4.9\% TS gain.
These results demonstrate Mesh-RFT's ability to improve geometric integrity and
topological regularity, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in
production-ready mesh generation. Project Page:

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖大量人工标注数据和训练模型引入偏见的问题。

Method: 利用LVLM作为提示重写器和奖励模型，通过强化学习实现自我改进。

Result: 在两个流行数据集上表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效减少了对人工标注的依赖，并提升了提示优化的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are powerful for producing high-quality images based on
given text prompts, but crafting these prompts often requires specialized
vocabulary. To address this, existing methods train rewriting models with
supervision from large amounts of manually annotated data and trained aesthetic
assessment models. To alleviate the dependence on data scale for model training
and the biases introduced by trained models, we propose a novel prompt
optimization framework, designed to rephrase a simple user prompt into a
sophisticated prompt to a text-to-image model. Specifically, we employ the
large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt,
and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and
alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious
human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards,
i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified
into one model and iterated in reinforcement learning to achieve
self-improvement by giving a solution and judging itself. Results on two
popular datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong
competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注多模态输入和文本推理，忽视了多模态输出推理的重要性，因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 构建RBench-V基准，包含803个涉及数学、物理、计数和游戏的问题，要求模型通过图像操作（如生成新图像或辅助线）进行推理。

Result: 最佳模型o3在RBench-V上仅达到25.8%准确率，远低于人类的82.3%。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态推理能力上仍有显著不足，RBench-V为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of native multi-modal models and omni-models,
exemplified by GPT-4o, Gemini, and o3, with their capability to process and
generate content across modalities such as text and images, marks a significant
milestone in the evolution of intelligence. Systematic evaluation of their
multi-modal output capabilities in visual thinking processes (also known as
multi-modal chain of thought, M-CoT) becomes critically important. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating multi-modal models primarily focus on
assessing multi-modal inputs and text-only reasoning while neglecting the
importance of reasoning through multi-modal outputs. In this paper, we present
a benchmark, dubbed RBench-V, designed to assess models' vision-indispensable
reasoning abilities. To construct RBench-V, we carefully hand-pick 803
questions covering math, physics, counting, and games. Unlike previous
benchmarks that typically specify certain input modalities, RBench-V presents
problems centered on multi-modal outputs, which require image manipulation such
as generating novel images and constructing auxiliary lines to support the
reasoning process. We evaluate numerous open- and closed-source models on
RBench-V, including o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, etc. Even the
best-performing model, o3, achieves only 25.8% accuracy on RBench-V, far below
the human score of 82.3%, highlighting that current models struggle to leverage
multi-modal reasoning. Data and code are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督学习框架，用于提取皮肤病学特征，相比基于ImageNet的预训练模型，该方法在医学影像领域表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习依赖大量标注数据和计算资源，而基于自然图像的预训练模型可能无法捕捉医学影像的领域特性。

Method: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）在皮肤病学数据集上进行无监督训练，学习结构化且临床相关的潜在空间。

Result: 自监督模型的验证损失降低33.33%，准确率提升44.44%，且过拟合差距接近零；ImageNet预训练模型虽然收敛快，但过拟合明显。

Conclusion: 领域特定的无监督特征提取在医学影像中具有更强的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision but relies heavily on large
labeled datasets and computational resources. Transfer learning, particularly
fine-tuning pretrained models, offers a practical alternative; however, models
pretrained on natural image datasets such as ImageNet may fail to capture
domain-specific characteristics in medical imaging. This study introduces an
unsupervised learning framework that extracts high-value dermatological
features instead of relying solely on ImageNet-based pretraining. We employ a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained from scratch on a proprietary
dermatological dataset, allowing the model to learn a structured and clinically
relevant latent space. This self-supervised feature extractor is then compared
to an ImageNet-pretrained backbone under identical classification conditions,
highlighting the trade-offs between general-purpose and domain-specific
pretraining. Our results reveal distinct learning patterns. The self-supervised
model achieves a final validation loss of 0.110 (-33.33%), while the
ImageNet-pretrained model stagnates at 0.100 (-16.67%), indicating overfitting.
Accuracy trends confirm this: the self-supervised model improves from 45% to
65% (+44.44%) with a near-zero overfitting gap, whereas the ImageNet-pretrained
model reaches 87% (+50.00%) but plateaus at 75% (+19.05%), with its overfitting
gap increasing to +0.060. These findings suggest that while ImageNet
pretraining accelerates convergence, it also amplifies overfitting on
non-clinically relevant features. In contrast, self-supervised learning
achieves steady improvements, stronger generalization, and superior
adaptability, underscoring the importance of domain-specific feature extraction
in medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有方法在领域转移时泛化能力不足，且未充分学习高度泛化的原型。

Method: 提出URM模型，利用大规模预训练视觉语言模型的通用表示构建相关性图。

Result: URM在领域内和新引入的领域泛化设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: URM通过通用表示显著提升了少样本计数的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot counting estimates the number of target objects in an image using
only a few annotated exemplars. However, domain shift severely hinders existing
methods to generalize to unseen scenarios. This falls into the realm of single
domain generalization that remains unexplored in few-shot counting. To solve
this problem, we begin by analyzing the main limitations of current methods,
which typically follow a standard pipeline that extract the object prototypes
from exemplars and then match them with image feature to construct the
correlation map. We argue that existing methods overlook the significance of
learning highly generalized prototypes. Building on this insight, we propose
the first single domain generalization few-shot counting model, Universal
Representation Matching, termed URM. Our primary contribution is the discovery
that incorporating universal vision-language representations distilled from a
large scale pretrained vision-language model into the correlation construction
process substantially improves robustness to domain shifts without compromising
in domain performance. As a result, URM achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both in domain and the newly introduced domain generalization setting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the runner-up solution for the Ego4D EgoSchema
Challenge at CVPR 2025 (Confirmed on May 20, 2025). Inspired by the success of
large models, we evaluate and leverage leading accessible multimodal large
models and adapt them to video understanding tasks via few-shot learning and
model ensemble strategies. Specifically, diversified prompt styles and process
paradigms are systematically explored and evaluated to effectively guide the
attention of large models, fully unleashing their powerful generalization and
adaptability abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that, with our
carefully designed approach, directly utilizing an individual multimodal model
already outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method which includes
several additional processes. Besides, an additional stage is further
introduced that facilitates the cooperation and ensemble of periodic results,
which achieves impressive performance improvements. We hope this work serves as
a valuable reference for the practical application of large models and inspires
future research in the field.

TL;DR: HASTE是一种两阶段训练方法，通过先对齐教师模型特征再终止对齐，显著加速DiTs训练，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DiTs训练速度慢的问题，尤其是REPA方法在后期性能下降的局限性。

Method: HASTE分为两阶段：第一阶段使用教师模型对齐特征和注意力图；第二阶段终止对齐，专注于去噪任务。

Result: HASTE在ImageNet和MS-COCO上显著加速训练，性能优于REPA。

Conclusion: HASTE是一种高效且通用的DiTs训练方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art image quality, yet
their training remains notoriously slow. A recent remedy -- representation
alignment (REPA) that matches DiT hidden features to those of a non-generative
teacher (e.g. DINO) -- dramatically accelerates the early epochs but plateaus
or even degrades performance later. We trace this failure to a capacity
mismatch: once the generative student begins modelling the joint data
distribution, the teacher's lower-dimensional embeddings and attention patterns
become a straitjacket rather than a guide. We then introduce HASTE (Holistic
Alignment with Stage-wise Termination for Efficient training), a two-phase
schedule that keeps the help and drops the hindrance. Phase I applies a
holistic alignment loss that simultaneously distills attention maps (relational
priors) and feature projections (semantic anchors) from the teacher into
mid-level layers of the DiT, yielding rapid convergence. Phase II then performs
one-shot termination that deactivates the alignment loss, once a simple trigger
such as a fixed iteration is hit, freeing the DiT to focus on denoising and
exploit its generative capacity. HASTE speeds up training of diverse DiTs
without architecture changes. On ImageNet 256X256, it reaches the vanilla
SiT-XL/2 baseline FID in 50 epochs and matches REPA's best FID in 500 epochs,
amounting to a 28X reduction in optimization steps. HASTE also improves
text-to-image DiTs on MS-COCO, demonstrating to be a simple yet principled
recipe for efficient diffusion training across various tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/HASTE .

Conclusion: REOBench揭示了当前模型的脆弱性，为开发更鲁棒的模型提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Earth observation foundation models have shown strong generalization across
multiple Earth observation tasks, but their robustness under real-world
perturbations remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench,
the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth
observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image
corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To
ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on
high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in
critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct
a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image
modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our
results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience
significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The
severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone
sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1%
to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly
in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth
observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable
insights for developing more robust and reliable models.

Method: 通过V2V方法绕过事件流生成，直接转换视频帧为事件体素网格，减少存储需求并支持参数随机化。

Result: 存储需求降低150倍，训练了10,000个视频（52小时），显著提升了视频重建和光流估计模型的性能。

Conclusion: V2V方法解决了事件数据存储和规模问题，为事件视觉模型的发展提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Event-based cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution,
high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, the massive storage
requirements and I/O burdens of existing synthetic data generation pipelines
and the scarcity of real data prevent event-based training datasets from
scaling up, limiting the development and generalization capabilities of event
vision models. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-to-Voxel (V2V), an
approach that directly converts conventional video frames into event-based
voxel grid representations, bypassing the storage-intensive event stream
generation entirely. V2V enables a 150 times reduction in storage requirements
while supporting on-the-fly parameter randomization for enhanced model
robustness. Leveraging this efficiency, we train several video reconstruction
and optical flow estimation model architectures on 10,000 diverse videos
totaling 52 hours--an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
yielding substantial improvements.

Abstract: The integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into autonomous driving
systems has shown promise in addressing key challenges such as learning
complexity, interpretability, and common-sense reasoning. However, existing
approaches often struggle with efficient integration and realtime
decision-making due to computational demands. In this paper, we introduce
SOLVE, an innovative framework that synergizes VLMs with end-to-end (E2E)
models to enhance autonomous vehicle planning. Our approach emphasizes
knowledge sharing at the feature level through a shared visual encoder,
enabling comprehensive interaction between VLM and E2E components. We propose a
Trajectory Chain-of-Thought (T-CoT) paradigm, which progressively refines
trajectory predictions, reducing uncertainty and improving accuracy. By
employing a temporal decoupling strategy, SOLVE achieves efficient cooperation
by aligning high-quality VLM outputs with E2E real-time performance. Evaluated
on the nuScenes dataset, our method demonstrates significant improvements in
trajectory prediction accuracy, paving the way for more robust and reliable
autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in video restoration under rainy
conditions over the past decade, largely propelled by advancements in deep
learning. Nevertheless, existing methods that depend on paired data struggle to
generalize effectively to real-world scenarios, primarily due to the disparity
between synthetic and authentic rain effects. To address these limitations, we
propose a dual-branch spatio-temporal state-space model to enhance rain streak
removal in video sequences. Specifically, we design spatial and temporal
state-space model layers to extract spatial features and incorporate temporal
dependencies across frames, respectively. To improve multi-frame feature
fusion, we derive a dynamic stacking filter, which adaptively approximates
statistical filters for superior pixel-wise feature refinement. Moreover, we
develop a median stacking loss to enable semi-supervised learning by generating
pseudo-clean patches based on the sparsity prior of rain. To further explore
the capacity of deraining models in supporting other vision-based tasks in
rainy environments, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark focused on object
detection and tracking in rainy conditions. Our method is extensively evaluated
across multiple benchmarks containing numerous synthetic and real-world rainy
videos, consistently demonstrating its superiority in quantitative metrics,
visual quality, efficiency, and its utility for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly
deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting
its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are
applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no
IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the
perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality
indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for
Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and
meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution
pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2)
established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted
image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision
Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained
and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA,
demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied
AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application
of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world. Project page:

Abstract: Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to
synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a
crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech --
remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that
transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative
dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character
expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the
first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior.
While a story generation model such as Text2Story generates the corresponding
visual scene, we focus on generating expressive character utterances from these
prompts and the scene image. We apply a pretrained vision-language encoder to
extract a high-level semantic feature from the representative frame, capturing
salient visual context. This feature is then combined with the structured
prompts and used to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural,
character-consistent dialogue. To ensure contextual consistency across scenes,
we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank that conditions each dialogue
generation on the accumulated dialogue history from prior scenes. This approach
enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals and
interactions throughout a story. Finally, we render each utterance as
expressive, character-consistent speech, resulting in fully-voiced video
narratives. Our framework requires no additional training and demonstrates
applicability across a variety of story settings, from fantasy adventures to
slice-of-life episodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交平台上多模态虚假信息的快速传播引发关注，但视频虚假信息检测研究因缺乏大规模多样化数据集而受限。现有方法易过拟合且缺乏深度推理。

Method: 提出FakeVV数据集（10万+视频-文本对）和Fact-R1框架，结合深度推理与规则强化学习，通过三阶段训练（CoT指令调优、DPO偏好对齐、GRPO优化）。

Result: Fact-R1在多模态虚假信息检测中展现出与文本强化学习系统相当的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为虚假信息检测建立了新范式，结合大规模视频理解、推理引导对齐和可解释验证。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised
growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains
limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods
often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive
content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale
benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained,
interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel
framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based
reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1)
misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference
alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This
enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those
observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more
complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm
for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding,
reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

### [203] [LaViDa: A Large Diffusion Language Model for Multimodal Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16839)
*Shufan Li,Konstantinos Kallidromitis,Hritik Bansal,Akash Gokul,Yusuke Kato,Kazuki Kozuka,Jason Kuen,Zhe Lin,Kai-Wei Chang,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaViDa是一种基于离散扩散模型（DMs）的视觉语言模型（VLMs），通过并行解码和双向上下文实现快速推理和可控生成，在多模态任务中表现优于自回归模型（AR VLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视觉语言模型（如LLaVA）在推理速度和可控生成方面存在不足，离散扩散模型（DMs）在多模态任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: LaViDa通过为DMs配备视觉编码器并联合微调，结合互补掩码、前缀KV缓存和时间步偏移等技术，优化训练和推理。

Result: LaViDa在多模态基准测试（如MMMU）中表现优于AR VLMs，在COCO字幕任务中CIDEr得分提升4.1，推理速度提高1.92倍。

Conclusion: LaViDa展示了DMs作为AR VLMs替代方案的潜力，具备灵活性、可控性和双向推理优势。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks
requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for
VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining
outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR)
VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs)
offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference
and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling.
While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks
is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build
LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the
combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges
encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking
for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep
shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves
competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such
as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible
speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO
captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x
speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained
Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR
VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的框架PAR，通过掩码自回归建模解决了全景图像生成中的两个关键问题：扩散模型不适用于ERP全景图，以及文本和图像条件生成任务分离的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全景图像生成方法存在两个主要问题：扩散模型因违反i.i.d.假设而不适用于ERP全景图，且文本和图像条件生成任务分离。

Method: 提出PAR框架，利用掩码自回归建模避免i.i.d.假设，并统一文本和图像条件生成任务。引入圆形填充和一致性对齐策略提升生成质量。

Result: 实验表明PAR在文本到图像生成和全景外绘任务中表现优异，具有可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PAR为全景图像生成提供了一种高效、统一的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in panoramic image generation has underscored two critical
limitations in existing approaches. First, most methods are built upon
diffusion models, which are inherently ill-suited for equirectangular
projection (ERP) panoramas due to the violation of the identically and
independently distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise assumption caused by their
spherical mapping. Second, these methods often treat text-conditioned
generation (text-to-panorama) and image-conditioned generation (panorama
outpainting) as separate tasks, relying on distinct architectures and
task-specific data. In this work, we propose a unified framework, Panoramic
AutoRegressive model (PAR), which leverages masked autoregressive modeling to
address these challenges. PAR avoids the i.i.d. assumption constraint and
integrates text and image conditioning into a cohesive architecture, enabling
seamless generation across tasks. To address the inherent discontinuity in
existing generative models, we introduce circular padding to enhance spatial
coherence and propose a consistency alignment strategy to improve generation
quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in
text-to-image generation and panorama outpainting tasks while showcasing
promising scalability and generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jenga是一种新型推理管道，通过动态注意力分割和渐进分辨率生成，显著提升视频扩散模型的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型的计算需求高，限制了实际部署，主要问题在于自注意力的二次复杂性和扩散模型的多步特性。

Method: Jenga结合了动态注意力分割（基于3D空间填充曲线选择相关token交互）和渐进分辨率生成（逐步增加潜在分辨率）。

Result: 实验表明，Jenga在多个先进视频扩散模型上实现了显著加速（8.83倍），生成质量几乎不变（VBench上性能下降0.01%）。

Conclusion: Jenga作为即插即用方案，无需重新训练模型，即可将推理时间从分钟级缩短到秒级，实现高质量视频生成。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable generation quality of video Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) models, their practical deployment is severely hindered by extensive
computational requirements. This inefficiency stems from two key challenges:
the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the
multi-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present
Jenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with
progressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1)
early denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later
steps do not require dense attention. Jenga introduces a block-wise attention
mechanism that dynamically selects relevant token interactions using 3D
space-filling curves, alongside a progressive resolution strategy that
gradually increases latent resolution during generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that Jenga achieves substantial speedups across multiple
state-of-the-art video diffusion models while maintaining comparable generation
quality (8.83$\times$ speedup with 0.01\% performance drop on VBench). As a
plug-and-play solution, Jenga enables practical, high-quality video generation
on modern hardware by reducing inference time from minutes to seconds --
without requiring model retraining. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出T2I-ConBench，一个用于文本到图像模型持续后训练的统一基准，分析了四种维度，并评估了十种方法，发现尚无方法在所有方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续后训练方法缺乏标准化评估协议，导致研究受限。

Method: 引入T2I-ConBench基准，结合自动化指标、人类偏好建模和视觉语言QA，评估十种方法。

Result: 发现没有方法在所有维度表现优异，跨任务泛化问题仍未解决。

Conclusion: 发布数据集、代码和评估工具，以加速文本到图像模型持续后训练的研究。

Abstract: Continual post-training adapts a single text-to-image diffusion model to
learn new tasks without incurring the cost of separate models, but naive
post-training causes forgetting of pretrained knowledge and undermines
zero-shot compositionality. We observe that the absence of a standardized
evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual post-training. To
address this, we introduce T2I-ConBench, a unified benchmark for continual
post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical
scenarios, item customization and domain enhancement, and analyzes four
dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3)
catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines
automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for
comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three
realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even
joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task
generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation
tools to accelerate research in continual post-training for text-to-image
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机拍摄的高分辨率视频为动物行为研究提供了新机会，但分离动物运动与无人机运动的技术挑战需要解决。

Method: 评估了三种方法：基于生物图像的配准技术、SfM管道和混合插值方法，应用于44匹斑马的逃跑事件视频。

Result: 最佳方法提取了斑马个体轨迹，发现逃跑时对齐增加、停止前间距短暂扩大、群体中心协调更紧密等行为模式。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且可扩展，有助于大规模动物集体行为研究。

Abstract: Ethological research increasingly benefits from the growing affordability and
accessibility of drones, which enable the capture of high-resolution footage of
animal movement at fine spatial and temporal scales. However, analyzing such
footage presents the technical challenge of separating animal movement from
drone motion. While non-trivial, computer vision techniques such as image
registration and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) offer practical solutions. For
conservationists, open-source tools that are user-friendly, require minimal
setup, and deliver timely results are especially valuable for efficient data
interpretation. This study evaluates three approaches: a bioimaging-based
registration technique, an SfM pipeline, and a hybrid interpolation method. We
apply these to a recorded escape event involving 44 plains zebras, captured in
a single drone video. Using the best-performing method, we extract individual
trajectories and identify key behavioral patterns: increased alignment
(polarization) during escape, a brief widening of spacing just before stopping,
and tighter coordination near the group's center. These insights highlight the
method's effectiveness and its potential to scale to larger datasets,
contributing to broader investigations of collective animal behavior.

Motivation: 现有驾驶模拟器和基准测试未能全面满足多模态感知、闭环评估、多样交通场景、多代理协作和高效计算等关键需求。

Method: 利用真实世界多模态传感器数据，分别重建背景场景和前景交通参与者，通过灵活的合成实现多样且真实的交通场景。

Result: RealEngine支持非反应性模拟、安全测试和多代理交互，形成一个可靠且全面的驾驶代理评估基准。

Conclusion: RealEngine通过结合场景重建和视图合成，实现了高真实感和几何准确性的驾驶模拟，填补了现有工具的不足。

Abstract: Driving simulation plays a crucial role in developing reliable driving agents
by providing controlled, evaluative environments. To enable meaningful
assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key
requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with
realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop
evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic
scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture
interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability
and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to
comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically
integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to
achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context.
By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs
background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for
highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene
composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis
enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring
both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this
environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories:
non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction,
collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the
real-world performance of driving agents.

Motivation: 现有T2I模型在长文本和细节密集型提示下表现不佳，缺乏专业应用的评估工具。

Method: 提出DetailMaster基准，包含四个评估维度（如属性绑定、空间关系），使用平均284.89个token的长提示。

Result: 评估显示，最先进模型在关键维度上仅达50%准确率，且性能随提示长度增加而下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在结构理解和细节处理上的系统性缺陷，呼吁未来研究改进架构，并开源数据集和工具。

Abstract: While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in
synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly
degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in
professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematical abilities
to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional
requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions:
Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene
Attributes, and Explicit Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark
comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high
quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5
long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations:
state-of-the-art models achieve merely ~50% accuracy in key dimensions like
attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive
performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis highlights
systemic failures in structural comprehension and detail overload handling,
motivating future research into architectures with enhanced compositional
reasoning. We open-source the dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools
to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable broad applications that would
otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

*Karlis Martins Briedis,Markus Gross,Christopher Schroers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种更高效的光流估计方法，通过改进全对相关体积采样实现，显著降低内存使用和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光流估计方法因计算和内存复杂度高，通常需降低分辨率处理图像，导致细节丢失。

Method: 改进全对相关体积采样的实现，保持与RAFT相同的数学操作，但更高效。

Result: 内存使用降低95%，速度提升90%，总推理时间节省50%，并在高分辨率数据集上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在内存受限环境下显著提升了光流估计的效率和精度。

Abstract: Recent optical flow estimation methods often employ local cost sampling from
a dense all-pairs correlation volume. This results in quadratic computational
and memory complexity in the number of pixels. Although an alternative
memory-efficient implementation with on-demand cost computation exists, this is
slower in practice and therefore prior methods typically process images at
reduced resolutions, missing fine-grained details.
  To address this, we propose a more efficient implementation of the all-pairs
correlation volume sampling, still matching the exact mathematical operator as
defined by RAFT. Our approach outperforms on-demand sampling by up to 90% while
maintaining low memory usage, and performs on par with the default
implementation with up to 95% lower memory usage. As cost sampling makes up a
significant portion of the overall runtime, this can translate to up to 50%
savings for the total end-to-end model inference in memory-constrained
environments. Our evaluation of existing methods includes an 8K
ultra-high-resolution dataset and an additional inference-time modification of
the recent SEA-RAFT method. With this, we achieve state-of-the-art results at
high resolutions both in accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFrameQA是首个专注于医学视觉问答（VQA）中多图像推理的基准测试，通过自动化流程和多阶段过滤策略构建高质量数据集，评估显示现有模型在多图像推理任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VQA基准多关注单图像分析，而临床诊断通常需要比较多张图像，因此需要更接近实际工作流程的评估方法。

Method: 开发自动化流程提取连贯医学视频帧，并通过多阶段过滤策略构建高质量数据集MedFrameQA，涵盖9个人体系统和43个器官。

Result: 评估10种先进多模态LLM模型，发现其表现普遍较差（准确率低于50%），且错误集中在忽略关键信息、跨图像证据整合错误等方面。

Conclusion: MedFrameQA有望推动临床多图像推理研究，促进更强大的诊断AI系统发展。

Abstract: Existing medical VQA benchmarks mostly focus on single-image analysis, yet
clinicians almost always compare a series of images before reaching a
diagnosis. To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the
first benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA.
To build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an
automated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos
and constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2)
a multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review,
to preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance. The resulting
dataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in
3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question
is accompanied by two to five images. We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced
Multimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit
reasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA. The evaluation challengingly reveals that
all models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy
fluctuates as the number of images per question increases. Error analysis
further shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate
evidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning
chains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and
modalities. We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded,
multi-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于用户指定的材料类型信息，而UniPhy通过共享训练提高鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: UniPhy通过潜在优化匹配观测到的运动数据，推断未知材料的属性，并支持重新模拟。

Result: UniPhy在多样材料（弹性、塑性、砂、流体）上表现优于现有方法，提供更准确的重新模拟。

Conclusion: UniPhy无需材料类型信息即可推断属性，适用于多样化场景，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: We propose UniPhy, a common latent-conditioned neural constitutive model that
can encode the physical properties of diverse materials. At inference UniPhy
allows `inverse simulation' i.e. inferring material properties by optimizing
the scene-specific latent to match the available observations via
differentiable simulation. In contrast to existing methods that treat such
inference as system identification, UniPhy does not rely on user-specified
material type information. Compared to prior neural constitutive modeling
approaches which learn instance specific networks, the shared training across
materials improves both, robustness and accuracy of the estimates. We train
UniPhy using simulated trajectories across diverse geometries and materials --
elastic, plasticine, sand, and fluids (Newtonian & non-Newtonian). At
inference, given an object with unknown material properties, UniPhy can infer
the material properties via latent optimization to match the motion
observations, and can then allow re-simulating the object under diverse
scenarios. We compare UniPhy against prior inverse simulation methods, and show
that the inference from UniPhy enables more accurate replay and re-simulation
under novel conditions.

TL;DR: OpenSeg-R是一个基于逐步视觉推理的开放词汇分割框架，利用大型多模态模型（LMMs）生成层次化视觉推理，显著提升了分割精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇分割（OVS）方法缺乏显式推理和上下文理解能力，导致在开放世界场景中难以区分相似类别。

Method: OpenSeg-R通过生成通用和图像特定的推理步骤，形成结构化三元组，并基于这些推理步骤生成详细描述提示，输入分割器以产生更准确的分割掩码。

Conclusion: OpenSeg-R首次将逐步视觉推理引入OVS，显著提升了分割精度和可解释性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its
capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However,
existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward
inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it
challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world
settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual
cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning
framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed
OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical
visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic
and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that
explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on
these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed
them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best
of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit
step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that
OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves
consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation.
Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided
framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Feature Mixing的简单快速方法，用于多模态异常合成，提升OOD检测性能，并在多个数据集上验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的多模态需求及缺乏未知数据监督信号的问题推动了研究。

Method: 采用Feature Mixing方法进行多模态异常合成，理论支持其有效性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最佳性能，速度提升显著（10倍至370倍）。

Conclusion: Feature Mixing是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多模态OOD检测。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and segmentation are crucial for
deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as
autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. While prior research has
primarily focused on unimodal image data, real-world applications are
inherently multimodal, requiring the integration of multiple modalities for
improved OOD detection. A key challenge is the lack of supervision signals from
unknown data, leading to overconfident predictions on OOD samples. To address
this challenge, we propose Feature Mixing, an extremely simple and fast method
for multimodal outlier synthesis with theoretical support, which can be further
optimized to help the model better distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD data. Feature Mixing is modality-agnostic and applicable to various
modality combinations. Additionally, we introduce CARLA-OOD, a novel multimodal
dataset for OOD segmentation, featuring synthetic OOD objects across diverse
scenes and weather conditions. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI,
nuScenes, CARLA-OOD datasets, and the MultiOOD benchmark demonstrate that
Feature Mixing achieves state-of-the-art performance with a $10 \times$ to $370
\times$ speedup. Our source code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: Dimple是首个离散扩散多模态大语言模型（DMLLM），通过结合自回归和扩散训练阶段，性能超越LLaVA-NEXT 3.9%，并提出自信解码策略提升推理效率。


<details>

Conclusion: 验证了DMLLM的可行性，提升了推理效率和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose Dimple, the first Discrete Diffusion Multimodal
Large Language Model (DMLLM). We observe that training with a purely discrete
diffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal
performance, and severe length bias issues. To address these challenges, we
design a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase
with a subsequent diffusion phase. This approach yields the Dimple-7B model,
trained on the same dataset and using a similar training pipeline as
LLaVA-NEXT. Dimple-7B ultimately surpasses LLaVA-NEXT in performance by 3.9%,
demonstrating that DMLLM can achieve performance comparable to that of
autoregressive models. To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding
strategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of
tokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation
iterations. In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during
generation equals the response length. With confident decoding, however, the
number of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\frac{\text{response
length}}{3}$. We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive
models and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on
most benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x.
Additionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response
using structure priors. These priors enable structured responses in a manner
distinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow
fine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to
achieve in autoregressive models. Overall, this work validates the feasibility
and advantages of DMLLM and enhances its inference efficiency and
controllability. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Recent advancement in deep learning encouraged developing large automatic
speech recognition (ASR) models that achieve promising results while ignoring
computational and memory constraints. However, deploying such models on low
resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance.
Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the
large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance
degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better
performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step
representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized
models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in
limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks
reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up
and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.

Conclusion: 为原生、主干级分割提供了新范式，适用于下游分割任务。

Abstract: Uniform downsampling remains the de facto standard for reducing spatial
resolution in vision backbones. In this work, we propose an alternative design
built around a content-aware spatial grouping layer, that dynamically assigns
tokens to a reduced set based on image boundaries and their semantic content.
Stacking our grouping layer across consecutive backbone stages results in
hierarchical segmentation that arises natively in the feature extraction
process, resulting in our coined Native Segmentation Vision Transformer. We
show that a careful design of our architecture enables the emergence of strong
segmentation masks solely from grouping layers, that is, without additional
segmentation-specific heads. This sets the foundation for a new paradigm of
native, backbone-level segmentation, which enables strong zero-shot results
without mask supervision, as well as a minimal and efficient standalone model
design for downstream segmentation tasks. Our project page is

Abstract: This paper studies the task of SatStreet-view synthesis, which aims to render
photorealistic street-view panorama images and videos given any satellite image
and specified camera positions or trajectories. We formulate to learn neural
radiance field from paired images captured from satellite and street
viewpoints, which comes to be a challenging learning problem due to the
sparse-view natural and the extremely-large viewpoint changes between satellite
and street-view images. We tackle the challenges based on a task-specific
observation that street-view specific elements, including the sky and
illumination effects are only visible in street-view panoramas, and present a
novel approach Sat2Density++ to accomplish the goal of photo-realistic
street-view panoramas rendering by modeling these street-view specific in
neural networks. In the experiments, our method is testified on both urban and
suburban scene datasets, demonstrating that Sat2Density++ is capable of
rendering photorealistic street-view panoramas that are consistent across
multiple views and faithful to the satellite image.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了面孔-声音关联的性能。

Abstract: We study the task of learning association between faces and voices, which is
gaining interest in the multimodal community lately. These methods suffer from
the deliberate crafting of negative mining procedures as well as the reliance
on the distant margin parameter. These issues are addressed by learning a joint
embedding space in which orthogonality constraints are applied to the fused
embeddings of faces and voices. However, embedding spaces of faces and voices
possess different characteristics and require spaces to be aligned before
fusing them. To this end, we propose a method that accurately aligns the
embedding spaces and fuses them with an enhanced gated fusion thereby improving
the performance of face-voice association. Extensive experiments on the
VoxCeleb dataset reveals the merits of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 学习互联网视频中的潜在运动对构建通用机器人至关重要，但现有方法存在信息丢失和难以处理复杂动态的问题。

Method: CoMo采用早期时间特征差异机制防止模型崩溃，并通过信息瓶颈原则约束潜在运动嵌入维度，同时引入两个新指标评估运动学习。

Result: CoMo展示了强大的零样本泛化能力，能够为未见过的视频域生成连续伪动作，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoMo通过连续运动表示和新指标，显著提升了运动学习的效果，并为统一策略联合学习提供了可能。

Abstract: Learning latent motion from Internet videos is crucial for building
generalist robots. However, existing discrete latent action methods suffer from
information loss and struggle with complex and fine-grained dynamics. We
propose CoMo, which aims to learn more informative continuous motion
representations from diverse, internet-scale videos. CoMo employs a early
temporal feature difference mechanism to prevent model collapse and suppress
static appearance noise, effectively discouraging shortcut learning problem.
Furthermore, guided by the information bottleneck principle, we constrain the
latent motion embedding dimensionality to achieve a better balance between
retaining sufficient action-relevant information and minimizing the inclusion
of action-irrelevant appearance noise. Additionally, we also introduce two new
metrics for more robustly and affordably evaluating motion and guiding motion
learning methods development: (i) the linear probing MSE of action prediction,
and (ii) the cosine similarity between past-to-current and future-to-current
motion embeddings. Critically, CoMo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization,
enabling it to generate continuous pseudo actions for previously unseen video
domains. This capability facilitates unified policy joint learning using pseudo
actions derived from various action-less video datasets (such as
cross-embodiment videos and, notably, human demonstration videos), potentially
augmented with limited labeled robot data. Extensive experiments show that
policies co-trained with CoMo pseudo actions achieve superior performance with
both diffusion and autoregressive architectures in simulated and real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工分析岩石薄片的矿物学特征主观且耗时，现有技术如QEMSCAN成本高且耗时长，需一种更高效、低成本的自动化方法。

Method: 使用U-Net语义分割架构，以平面和交叉偏振薄片图像为输入，QEMSCAN映射为目标进行训练，并验证模型在训练中未见岩石相上的泛化能力。

Result: 模型在矿物边界划分和分布估计上表现良好，R^2值在训练相上超过0.97，未见相上为0.88。

Conclusion: 模型在低成本、高效性上表现优异，但分割质量受图像分辨率差异和岩石纹理多样性影响。

Abstract: Interpreting the mineralogical aspects of rock thin sections is an important
task for oil and gas reservoirs evaluation. However, human analysis tend to be
subjective and laborious. Technologies like QEMSCAN(R) are designed to automate
the mineralogical mapping process, but also suffer from limitations like high
monetary costs and time-consuming analysis. This work proposes a Convolutional
Neural Network model for automatic mineralogical segmentation of thin section
images of carbonate rocks. The model is able to mimic the QEMSCAN mapping
itself in a low-cost, generalized and efficient manner. For this, the U-Net
semantic segmentation architecture is trained on plane and cross polarized thin
section images using the corresponding QEMSCAN maps as target, which is an
approach not widely explored. The model was instructed to differentiate
occurrences of Calcite, Dolomite, Mg-Clay Minerals, Quartz, Pores and the
remaining mineral phases as an unique class named "Others", while it was
validated on rock facies both seen and unseen during training, in order to
address its generalization capability. Since the images and maps are provided
in different resolutions, image registration was applied to align then
spatially. The study reveals that the quality of the segmentation is very much
dependent on these resolution differences and on the variety of learnable rock
textures. However, it shows promising results, especially with regard to the
proper delineation of minerals boundaries on solid textures and precise
estimation of the minerals distributions, describing a nearly linear
relationship between expected and predicted distributions, with coefficient of
determination (R^2) superior to 0.97 for seen facies and 0.88 for unseen.

Motivation: 传统视频分词器无法灵活分配token，导致资源浪费或性能不足。AdapTok旨在实现内容感知的动态token分配。

Method: 采用块掩码策略和块因果评分器，训练时随机丢弃尾部token，预测不同token数量下的重建质量。推理时基于整数线性规划动态分配token。

Result: 在UCF-101和Kinetics-600数据集上，AdapTok显著提升了重建质量和生成性能，且无需额外数据。

Conclusion: AdapTok实现了高效、可扩展的视频建模，为生成式视频模型提供了更优的token分配方案。

Abstract: We propose AdapTok, an adaptive temporal causal video tokenizer that can
flexibly allocate tokens for different frames based on video content. AdapTok
is equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens
of each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the
reconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens.
During inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear
programming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores.
Such design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token
allocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video
reconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok
consistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under
different token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient
generative video modeling.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in visual

leaving them ill-suited for robotics and other real-world applications that
require multi-frame reasoning. In this paper, we propose a framework to equip
MLLMs with robust multi-frame spatial understanding by integrating depth

approach is the MultiSPA dataset, a novel, large-scale collection of more than
27 million samples spanning diverse 3D and 4D scenes. Alongside MultiSPA, we
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that tests a wide spectrum of spatial tasks
under uniform metrics. Our resulting model, Multi-SpatialMLLM, achieves
significant gains over baselines and proprietary systems, demonstrating
scalable, generalizable multi-frame reasoning. We further observe multi-task
benefits and early indications of emergent capabilities in challenging
scenarios, and showcase how our model can serve as a multi-frame reward
annotator for robotics.

Motivation: 研究旨在填补自回归图像生成领域中RL算法应用的空白，特别是针对CoT推理的独特挑战，如文本-图像一致性和奖励模型设计。

Method: 通过全面评估GRPO和DPO算法在自回归图像生成中的表现，分析其领域内性能和跨领域泛化能力，并探索三种扩展策略。

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发更有效的RL算法以实现自回归图像生成中的稳健CoT推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central
to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image
generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents
unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass
ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and
designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler
rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these
explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific
challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this
gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO
algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain
performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of
different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal
that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward
models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially
enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,
we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both
their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into
efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a
new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms
to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image
generation. Code is released at

Conclusion: 通过监督思考过程和优化奖励机制，SophiaVL-R1显著提升了模型的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement
learning (RL) with outcome rewards. However, this paradigm typically lacks
supervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result,
the model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its
generalization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt
to add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve
this, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the
entire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for
certain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which
assigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This
weight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading
to correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of
potentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing
training strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time,
allowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in
later training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series
of reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU),
demonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our
SophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite
the latter having 10 times more parameters. All code, models, and datasets are

Conclusion: CrossLMM通过高效令牌压缩和双交叉注意力机制，解决了长视频序列处理中的计算成本问题。

Abstract: The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly enhanced Large
Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret diverse data modalities (e.g.,
image and video). However, as input complexity increases, particularly with
long video sequences, the number of required tokens has grown significantly,
leading to quadratically computational costs. This has made the efficient
compression of video tokens in LMMs, while maintaining performance integrity, a
pressing research challenge. In this paper, we introduce CrossLMM, decoupling
long video sequences from LMMs via a dual cross-attention mechanism, which
substantially reduces visual token quantity with minimal performance
degradation. Specifically, we first implement a significant token reduction
from pretrained visual encoders through a pooling methodology. Then, within LLM
layers, we employ a visual-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, wherein the
pooled visual tokens function as queries against the original visual token set.
This module enables more efficient token utilization while retaining
fine-grained informational fidelity. In addition, we introduce a text-to-visual
cross-attention mechanism, for which the text tokens are enhanced through
interaction with the original visual tokens, enriching the visual comprehension
of the text tokens. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our
approach achieves comparable or superior performance across diverse video-based
LMM benchmarks, despite utilizing substantially fewer computational resources.

Abstract: As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more capable, there is growing
interest in evaluating their reasoning processes alongside their final outputs.
However, most benchmarks remain focused on English, overlooking languages with
rich linguistic and cultural contexts, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we
introduce the Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark (ARB), the
first benchmark designed to evaluate step-by-step reasoning in Arabic across
both textual and visual modalities. ARB spans 11 diverse domains, including
visual reasoning, document understanding, OCR, scientific analysis, and

5,119 human-curated reasoning steps and corresponding actions. We evaluated 12
state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LMMs and found persistent challenges
in coherence, faithfulness, and cultural grounding. ARB offers a structured
framework for diagnosing multimodal reasoning in underrepresented languages and
marks a critical step toward inclusive, transparent, and culturally aware AI
systems. We release the benchmark, rubric, and evaluation suit to support

Learning Models (TGLMs) address this issue by converting graphs into ordered
token lists for scalable processing. Besides, TGLMs also empower Large Language
Models (LLMs) to handle text-attributed graphs more effectively and thus are
also employed in Graph LLMs. However, existing TGLMs rely on hand-designed
token lists and their adaptability to diverse graph learning scenarios remains
unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct extensive empirical and theoretical
preliminary studies for hand-designed token lists. Surprisingly, we identify an
unexplored hop-overpriority problem: the common pre-defined token lists
overemphasize nearby nodes and overwhelm the ability of TGLMs to balance local
and global signals. This phenomenon is especially harmful for heterophilic
graphs. To address this problem, we propose the Learnable Graph Token List
(LGTL), a plug-and-play module to replace hand-designed token lists in TGLMs.
Specifically, LGTL adaptively adjusts the weights across hops and prioritizes
informative nodes within hops through a graph attention gate module and a
selection module, respectively. In this way, contextually informative nodes can
be adaptively emphasized for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Besides,
we theoretically show that LGTL can address the hop-overpriority problem.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the efficacy of LGTL across both
Graph Transformers and Graph LLM backbones.

*Valentin Villecroze,Yixin Wang,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LLEB（最后一层经验贝叶斯）的新方法，用于量化神经网络预测的不确定性，介于贝叶斯神经网络和深度集成方法之间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络预测的不确定性是人工智能领域的关键挑战，现有方法如贝叶斯神经网络和深度集成各有局限性。

Method: LLEB通过使用归一化流作为可学习的先验，仅应用于最后一层，以最大化证据下界，从而在计算上保持可操作性。

Result: LLEB在性能上与现有方法相当，表明经验贝叶斯是未来不确定性量化研究的有前景方向。

Conclusion: LLEB结合了贝叶斯神经网络和深度集成的优点，为不确定性量化提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The task of quantifying the inherent uncertainty associated with neural
network predictions is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Bayesian
neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles are among the most prominent
approaches to tackle this task. Both approaches produce predictions by
computing an expectation of neural network outputs over some distribution on
the corresponding weights; this distribution is given by the posterior in the
case of BNNs, and by a mixture of point masses for ensembles. Inspired by
recent work showing that the distribution used by ensembles can be understood
as a posterior corresponding to a learned data-dependent prior, we propose last
layer empirical Bayes (LLEB). LLEB instantiates a learnable prior as a
normalizing flow, which is then trained to maximize the evidence lower bound;
to retain tractability we use the flow only on the last layer. We show why LLEB
is well motivated, and how it interpolates between standard BNNs and ensembles
in terms of the strength of the prior that they use. LLEB performs on par with
existing approaches, highlighting that empirical Bayes is a promising direction
for future research in uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RTN（Round-to-Nearest）是一种简单且成本低的量化方法，尽管被更先进的方法所忽视，但本文证明其在吞吐量和准确性上可媲美甚至优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳RTN在量化LLMs中被低估的观点，证明其实际性能和成本优势。

Method: 基于Marlin内核实现RTN，并通过选择性提高某些层和模块的数据精度逐步提升准确性。

Result: RTN的吞吐量优于其他方法，准确性相近，且成本更低。

Conclusion: RTN是量化LLMs的可行且实用的选择。

Abstract: Quantization became a necessary tool for serving ever-increasing Large
Language Models (LLMs). RTN (Round-to-Nearest) is perhaps the simplest
quantization technique that has been around well before LLMs surged to the
forefront of machine learning (ML) research. Yet, it has been largely dismissed
by recent and more advanced quantization methods that claim superiority over
RTN in nearly every aspect of performance. This work aims to dispel this
established point of view, showing that RTN is not only much cheaper to apply,
but also its token generation throughput can be better than and accuracy can be
similar to more advanced alternatives. In particular, we discuss our
implementation of RTN based on the recent Marlin kernels and demonstrate how
the accuracy of RTN can be gradually improved by selectively increasing the
data precision format of certain model layers and modules. Based on our
results, we argue that RTN presents a viable and practical choice for
quantizing LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习性能评估库存在碎片化、实现不一致和数据验证不足的问题，导致结果不可靠。

Result: AllMetrics能够减少评估错误，提高机器学习工作流的可信度。

Conclusion: AllMetrics为机器学习任务提供了一种标准化、可靠的性能评估解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models rely heavily on consistent and accurate
performance metrics to evaluate and compare their effectiveness. However,
existing libraries often suffer from fragmentation, inconsistent
implementations, and insufficient data validation protocols, leading to
unreliable results. Existing libraries have often been developed independently
and without adherence to a unified standard, particularly concerning the
specific tasks they aim to support. As a result, each library tends to adopt
its conventions for metric computation, input/output formatting, error
handling, and data validation protocols. This lack of standardization leads to
both implementation differences (ID) and reporting differences (RD), making it
difficult to compare results across frameworks or ensure reliable evaluations.
To address these issues, we introduce AllMetrics, an open-source unified Python
library designed to standardize metric evaluation across diverse ML tasks,
including regression, classification, clustering, segmentation, and
image-to-image translation. The library implements class-specific reporting for
multi-class tasks through configurable parameters to cover all use cases, while
incorporating task-specific parameters to resolve metric computation
discrepancies across implementations. Various datasets from domains like
healthcare, finance, and real estate were applied to our library and compared
with Python, Matlab, and R components to identify which yield similar results.
AllMetrics combines a modular Application Programming Interface (API) with
robust input validation mechanisms to ensure reproducibility and reliability in
model evaluation. This paper presents the design principles, architectural
components, and empirical analyses demonstrating the ability to mitigate
evaluation errors and to enhance the trustworthiness of ML workflows.

Motivation: 当前fMRI视觉解码研究过于注重重建保真度而忽视可解释性，限制了神经科学洞察的获取。

Method: 采用层次化Mixture-of-Experts架构，专家网络处理功能相关体素群，通过CLIP空间编码和双阶段路由机制指导扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 实验验证了高重建保真度，并通过瓶颈分析证明其有效利用fMRI信号，避免过度依赖生成先验。

Conclusion: MoRE-Brain为fMRI视觉解码提供了更通用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand
human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However,
current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while
overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific
insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework
designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction.
MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture
where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel
groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to
encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then
synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing
mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion
process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a
novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for
neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by
sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers.
Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing
reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and
spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate
MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further
demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine
neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently,
MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and
interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon:

parameterizations with learnable activation functions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）用于解释大语言模型（LLMs）的内部激活，但现有评估忽略了概念表示对输入扰动的鲁棒性。本文提出鲁棒性量化方法，发现微小对抗扰动可操纵SAE表示，表明其脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE评估忽视概念表示的鲁棒性，而鲁棒性对概念标签的保真度至关重要。

Method: 通过输入空间优化问题量化鲁棒性，开发包含对抗扰动场景的评估框架。

Result: 微小对抗扰动可有效操纵SAE概念表示，且不影响LLM输出。

Conclusion: SAE概念表示脆弱，可能不适合模型监控和监管应用。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal
activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to
human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs
focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human
(auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical
aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We
argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept
representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we
formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and
develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in
which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations.
Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively
manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably
affecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves. Overall, our results suggest
that SAE concept representations are fragile and may be ill-suited for
applications in model monitoring and oversight.

Result: GradPCA在标准图像分类基准上表现优于现有方法，且特征质量（如预训练表示）对检测效果有重要影响。

Conclusion: GradPCA提供了一种有效的OOD检测方法，其理论框架为设计更合理的光谱检测器提供了指导。

Abstract: We introduce GradPCA, an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection method that
exploits the low-rank structure of neural network gradients induced by Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) alignment. GradPCA applies Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to gradient class-means, achieving more consistent performance than
existing methods across standard image classification benchmarks. We provide a
theoretical perspective on spectral OOD detection in neural networks to support
GradPCA, highlighting feature-space properties that enable effective detection
and naturally emerge from NTK alignment. Our analysis further reveals that
feature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained
representations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will
succeed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and
our theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled
spectral OOD detectors.

Result: FtU可以减少歧视且不降低准确性，适用于高风险场景。

Conclusion: FtU值得在实际应用中考虑，使用受保护属性需有明确依据。

Abstract: Fairness through Unawareness (FtU) describes the idea that discrimination
against demographic groups can be avoided by not considering group membership
in the decisions or predictions. This idea has long been criticized in the
machine learning literature as not being sufficient to ensure fairness. In
addition, the use of additional features is typically thought to increase the
accuracy of the predictions for all groups, so that FtU is sometimes thought to
be detrimental to all groups. In this paper, we show both theoretically and
empirically that FtU can reduce algorithmic discrimination without necessarily
reducing accuracy. We connect this insight with the literature on Model
Multiplicity, to which we contribute with novel theoretical and empirical
results. Furthermore, we illustrate how, in a real-life application, FtU can
contribute to the deployment of more equitable policies without losing
efficacy. Our findings suggest that FtU is worth considering in practical
applications, particularly in high-risk scenarios, and that the use of
protected attributes such as gender in predictive models should be accompanied
by a clear and well-founded justification.

Conclusion: 研究增强了扩散轨迹蒸馏的理论理解，并为改进蒸馏策略提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in
diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow
sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the
multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step,
enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off
between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain
limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a
first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory
distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each
step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy
data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and
rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal
shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both
discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a
dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that
maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence
of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data
covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of
diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving
distillation strategies.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNNs）的消息传递方法存在表达力受限、过平滑、过压缩及长距离依赖建模能力不足等问题，限制了其作为图基础模型的潜力。

Method: 引入G²PM框架，将图实例表示为子结构序列，并通过生成式预训练学习通用且可迁移的表示。

Conclusion: G²PM为可扩展的图学习提供了一个强有力的基础，并在节点分类、图分类和迁移学习等任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) has been predominantly driven by
message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local
neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from
fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness,
over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range
dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model
size often fails to yield improved performance, limiting the viability of GNNs
as backbones for graph foundation models. In this work, we explore pathways
beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine
(G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM
represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of
substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn
generalizable, transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates
strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with
model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches
that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we
systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural
choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse
tasks -- including node classification, graph classification, and transfer
learning -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a
compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are

Result: 在2D和3D地震走时建模中表现出优越性能、可扩展性和用户可控性。

Conclusion: 该框架为Eikonal问题提供了一种高效、灵活且可操控的解决方案，适用于多种黎曼流形。

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Eikonal Solvers, a novel framework that
integrates Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) with Neural Eikonal Solvers. Our
approach employs a single neural field where a unified shared backbone is
conditioned on signal-specific latent variables - represented as point clouds
in a Lie group - to model diverse Eikonal solutions. The ENF integration
ensures equivariant mapping from these latent representations to the solution
field, delivering three key benefits: enhanced representation efficiency
through weight-sharing, robust geometric grounding, and solution steerability.
This steerability allows transformations applied to the latent point cloud to
induce predictable, geometrically meaningful modifications in the resulting
Eikonal solution. By coupling these steerable representations with
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our framework accurately models
Eikonal travel-time solutions while generalizing to arbitrary Riemannian
manifolds with regular group actions. This includes homogeneous spaces such as
Euclidean, position-orientation, spherical, and hyperbolic manifolds. We
validate our approach through applications in seismic travel-time modeling of
2D and 3D benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance, scalability, adaptability, and user controllability compared to
existing Neural Operator-based Eikonal solver methods.

Result: RLAF训练的策略显著降低了不同SAT求解器的平均求解时间，某些情况下提速超过2倍，并能泛化到更大更难的问題。

Conclusion: RLAF为组合优化中的数据驱动启发式设计提供了新思路，其性能优于基于手工权重启发式的专家监督方法。

Abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are foundational to computer science,
yet their performance typically hinges on hand-crafted heuristics. This work
introduces Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF) as a paradigm
for learning to guide SAT solver branching heuristics with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Central to our approach is a novel and generic mechanism for
injecting inferred variable weights and polarities into the branching
heuristics of existing SAT solvers. In a single forward pass, a GNN assigns
these parameters to all variables. Casting this one-shot guidance as a
reinforcement learning problem lets us train the GNN with off-the-shelf
policy-gradient methods, such as GRPO, directly using the solver's
computational cost as the sole reward signal. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that RLAF-trained policies significantly reduce the mean solve times of
different base solvers across diverse SAT problem distributions, achieving more
than a 2x speedup in some cases, while generalizing effectively to larger and
harder problems after training. Notably, these policies consistently outperform
expert-supervised approaches based on learning handcrafted weighting
heuristics, offering a promising path towards data-driven heuristic design in
combinatorial optimization.

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效内存利用的MoE设计提供了指导，可在不牺牲推理速度的情况下优化部署。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
(LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy
large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert
offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on
slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited
the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar
experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models
and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure
local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance
(SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs
of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which
measures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size
limit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found
that models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit
the highest local routing consistency. We further showed that
domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than
vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache
effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active
experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and
deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for
replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

Conclusion: mesh-free SINDy是一种高效、鲁棒且易于实现的方法，适用于广泛的科学和工程问题。

Abstract: Identifying the governing equations of a dynamical system is one of the most
important tasks for scientific modeling. However, this procedure often requires
high-quality spatio-temporal data uniformly sampled on structured grids. In
this paper, we propose mesh-free SINDy, a novel algorithm which leverages the
power of neural network approximation as well as auto-differentiation to
identify governing equations from arbitrary sensor placements and non-uniform
temporal data sampling. We show that mesh-free SINDy is robust to high noise
levels and limited data while remaining computationally efficient. In our
implementation, the training procedure is straight-forward and nearly free of
hyperparameter tuning, making mesh-free SINDy widely applicable to many
scientific and engineering problems. In the experiments, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on a series of PDEs including the Burgers' equation, the heat
equation, the Korteweg-De Vries equation and the 2D advection-diffusion
equation. We conduct detailed numerical experiments on all datasets, varying
the noise levels and number of samples, and we also compare our approach to
previous state-of-the-art methods. It is noteworthy that, even in high-noise
and low-data scenarios, mesh-free SINDy demonstrates robust PDE discovery,
achieving successful identification with up to 75% noise for the Burgers'
equation using 5,000 samples and with as few as 100 samples and 1% noise. All
of this is achieved within a training time of under one minute.

Motivation: 在现实环境中（如半导体制造），修改已部署系统通常不可行或成本高昂，需要一种无需调整模型或硬件的优化方法。

Method: MFL 利用轻量级反向模型迭代优化输入，支持稳定性感知优化，适应高维控制场景。

Abstract: We introduce Model Feedback Learning (MFL), a novel test-time optimization
framework for optimizing inputs to pre-trained AI models or deployed hardware
systems without requiring any retraining of the models or modifications to the
hardware. In contrast to existing methods that rely on adjusting model
parameters, MFL leverages a lightweight reverse model to iteratively search for
optimal inputs, enabling efficient adaptation to new objectives under
deployment constraints. This framework is particularly advantageous in
real-world settings, such as semiconductor manufacturing recipe generation,
where modifying deployed systems is often infeasible or cost-prohibitive. We
validate MFL on semiconductor plasma etching tasks, where it achieves target
recipe generation in just five iterations, significantly outperforming both
Bayesian optimization and human experts. Beyond semiconductor applications, MFL
also demonstrates strong performance in chemical processes (e.g., chemical
vapor deposition) and electronic systems (e.g., wire bonding), highlighting its
broad applicability. Additionally, MFL incorporates stability-aware
optimization, enhancing robustness to process variations and surpassing
conventional supervised learning and random search methods in high-dimensional
control settings. By enabling few-shot adaptation, MFL provides a scalable and
efficient paradigm for deploying intelligent control in real-world
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Merge to Mix的新方法，通过模型合并加速数据集混合的构建，避免了传统试错法的多次微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据集混合方法依赖启发式和试错，效率低下，需要多次微调才能达到理想效果。

Method: 利用模型合并技术，将单独微调后的模型通过简单算术操作合并，作为整个数据集混合的代理模型。

Result: 实验表明，Merge to Mix在数据集选择上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Merge to Mix提供了一种高效的数据集混合构建方法，显著减少了微调的需求。

Abstract: Mixing datasets for fine-tuning large models (LMs) has become critical for
maximizing performance on downstream tasks. However, composing effective
dataset mixtures typically relies on heuristics and trial-and-error, often
requiring multiple fine-tuning runs to achieve the desired outcome. We propose
a novel method, $\textit{Merge to Mix}$, that accelerates composing dataset
mixtures through model merging. Model merging is a recent technique that
combines the abilities of multiple individually fine-tuned LMs into a single LM
by using a few simple arithmetic operations. Our key insight is that merging
models individually fine-tuned on each dataset in a mixture can effectively
serve as a surrogate for a model fine-tuned on the entire mixture. Merge to Mix
leverages this insight to accelerate selecting dataset mixtures without
requiring full fine-tuning on each candidate mixture. Our experiments
demonstrate that Merge to Mix surpasses state-of-the-art methods in dataset
selection for fine-tuning LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出BVAE以简化网络结构，减少参数数量，同时保持或提升性能。

Method: 使用单一神经网络双向编码和解码，通过相同突触网络实现。

Result: 在图像重建、分类、插值和生成任务中，BVAE参数减少50%，性能略优于传统VAE。

Conclusion: BVAE是一种高效且性能优越的变分自编码器架构。

Abstract: We present the new bidirectional variational autoencoder (BVAE) network

instead of an encoder-decoder network pair. The network encodes in the forward

Simulations compared BVAEs and ordinary VAEs on the four image tasks of image
reconstruction, classification, interpolation, and generation. The image
datasets included MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过集成多个稀疏自编码器（SAEs）提升特征提取能力，改进下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个SAE只能提取激活空间中的有限特征子集，集成方法可以弥补这一局限性。

Method: 采用朴素装袋和提升方法集成多个SAE，分别通过不同权重初始化和残差最小化训练。

Result: 集成SAEs在语言模型激活重建、特征多样性和稳定性上表现更优，下游任务如概念检测和虚假相关去除效果更好。

Conclusion: 集成SAEs优于单一SAE，具有更高的实用价值。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into human-interpretable features. Typically, features learned by a single SAE
are used for downstream applications. However, it has recently been shown that
SAEs trained with different initial weights can learn different features,
demonstrating that a single SAE captures only a limited subset of features that
can be extracted from the activation space. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose to ensemble multiple SAEs through naive bagging and boosting.
Specifically, SAEs trained with different weight initializations are ensembled
in naive bagging, whereas SAEs sequentially trained to minimize the residual
error are ensembled in boosting. We evaluate our ensemble approaches with three
settings of language models and SAE architectures. Our empirical results
demonstrate that ensembling SAEs can improve the reconstruction of language
model activations, diversity of features, and SAE stability. Furthermore,
ensembling SAEs performs better than applying a single SAE on downstream tasks
such as concept detection and spurious correlation removal, showing improved
practical utility.

Result: 实验表明，FR-Mamba在流场重建任务中显著优于现有方法，尤其在长序列上表现优异。

Conclusion: FR-Mamba通过创新的时空建模方法，为物理场重建提供了高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Physical field reconstruction (PFR) aims to predict the state distribution of
physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure, and temperature) based on
limited sensor measurements. It plays a critical role in domains such as fluid
dynamics and thermodynamics. However, existing deep learning methods often fail
to capture long-range temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal
performance on time-evolving physical systems. To address this, we propose
FR-Mamba, a novel spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction framework based on
state space modeling. Specifically, we design a hybrid neural network
architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model
(SSM) to capture both global spatial features and long-range temporal
dependencies. We adopt Mamba, a recently proposed efficient SSM architecture,
to model long-range temporal dependencies with linear time complexity. In
parallel, the FNO is employed to capture non-local spatial features by
leveraging frequency-domain transformations. The spatiotemporal representations
extracted by these two components are then fused to reconstruct the full-field
distribution of the physical system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing PFR methods in flow field
reconstruction tasks, achieving high-accuracy performance on long sequences.

Abstract: Much research has been done to analyze the stock market. After all, if one
can determine a pattern in the chaotic frenzy of transactions, then they could
make a hefty profit from capitalizing on these insights. As such, the goal of
our project was to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to determine the best time
to buy a stock within a given time frame. With only a few adjustments, our
model can be extended to identify the best time to sell a stock as well. In
order to use the format of free, real-world data to train the model, we define
our own Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem. These two papers [5] [6] helped
us in formulating the state space and the reward system of our MDP problem. We
train a series of agents using Q-Learning, Q-Learning with linear function
approximation, and deep Q-Learning. In addition, we try to predict the stock
prices using machine learning regression and classification models. We then
compare our agents to see if they converge on a policy, and if so, which one
learned the best policy to maximize profit on the stock market.

Motivation: 键盘记录器检测对系统安全至关重要，传统方法需要改进以应对复杂攻击。

Method: 使用多种机器学习模型和集成方法，结合特征选择（如Fisher Score），并应用SHAP和LIME进行模型解释。

Result: AdaBoost模型表现最佳，准确率达99.76%，F1分数0.99，其他指标接近完美。

Conclusion: 研究证明了AdaBoost结合特征选择在键盘记录器检测中的高效性，同时可解释AI技术增强了模型透明度。

Abstract: Keylogger detection involves monitoring for unusual system behaviors such as
delays between typing and character display, analyzing network traffic patterns
for data exfiltration. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis for
keylogger detection with traditional machine learning models - SVC, Random
Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
and advanced ensemble methods including Stacking, Blending and Voting.
Moreover, feature selection approaches such as Information gain, Lasso L1 and
Fisher Score are thoroughly assessed to improve predictive performance and
lower computational complexity. The Keylogger Detection dataset from publicly
available Kaggle website is used in this project. In addition to accuracy-based
classification, this study implements the approach for model interpretation
using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques namely SHAP (Global) and LIME (Local) to
deliver finer explanations for how much each feature contributes in assisting
or hindering the detection process. To evaluate the models result, we have used
AUC score, sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy and F1 score. The best
performance was achieved by AdaBoost with 99.76% accuracy, F1 score of 0.99,
100% precision, 98.6% recall, 1.0 specificity and 0.99 of AUC that is
near-perfect classification with Fisher Score.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架，用于量化大型语言模型（LLM）与外部工具结合时的整体不确定性，以提高高风险应用中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM与外部工具结合的场景中，现有方法未能有效量化整体不确定性，影响了高风险应用（如医疗决策）的可靠性。

Method: 扩展了针对标记序列的不确定性量化方法，提出了高效近似计算，适用于工具调用场景。

Result: 在合成QA数据集和检索增强生成（RAG）系统中验证了框架的有效性，显示其能增强对LLM系统的信任。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了LLM系统在依赖外部工具时的可靠性，特别是在内部知识不足的情况下。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often require external tools, such as
machine learning classifiers or knowledge retrieval systems, to provide
accurate answers in domains where their pre-trained knowledge is insufficient.
This integration of LLMs with external tools expands their utility but also
introduces a critical challenge: determining the trustworthiness of responses
generated by the combined system. In high-stakes applications, such as medical
decision-making, it is essential to assess the uncertainty of both the LLM's
generated text and the tool's output to ensure the reliability of the final
response. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods do not account
for the tool-calling scenario, where both the LLM and external tool contribute
to the overall system's uncertainty. In this work, we present a novel framework
for modeling tool-calling LLMs that quantifies uncertainty by jointly
considering the predictive uncertainty of the LLM and the external tool. We
extend previous methods for uncertainty quantification over token sequences to
this setting and propose efficient approximations that make uncertainty
computation practical for real-world applications. We evaluate our framework on
two new synthetic QA datasets, derived from well-known machine learning
datasets, which require tool-calling for accurate answers. Additionally, we
apply our method to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and conduct a
proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of our uncertainty
metrics in scenarios where external information retrieval is needed. Our
results show that the framework is effective in enhancing trust in LLM-based
systems, especially in cases where the LLM's internal knowledge is insufficient
and external tools are required.

*Aditya T. Vadlamani,Anutam Srinivasan,Pranav Maneriker,Ali Payani,Srinivasan Parthasarathy*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于共形预测的公平性概念（Conformal Fairness），并提供了一个理论支持的算法和框架，用于控制不同敏感群体之间的覆盖率差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测（CP）虽然能提供关于真实标签覆盖率的概率保证，但这些保证忽略了数据中敏感属性的存在。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用共形预测的交换性假设（而非传统的IID假设），提出了一种算法和框架，适用于非IID数据（如图数据）。

Result: 在图和表格数据集上的实验表明，该算法能够控制公平性相关的差距，同时覆盖率与理论预期一致。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Conformal Fairness框架为共形预测中的公平性问题提供了理论支持和实际解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification
with machine learning models. While conformal prediction provides probabilistic
guarantees regarding the coverage of the true label, these guarantees are
agnostic to the presence of sensitive attributes within the dataset. In this
work, we formalize \textit{Conformal Fairness}, a notion of fairness using
conformal predictors, and provide a theoretically well-founded algorithm and
associated framework to control for the gaps in coverage between different
sensitive groups. Our framework leverages the exchangeability assumption
(implicit to CP) rather than the typical IID assumption, allowing us to apply
the notion of Conformal Fairness to data types and tasks that are not IID, such
as graph data. Experiments were conducted on graph and tabular datasets to
demonstrate that the algorithm can control fairness-related gaps in addition to
coverage aligned with theoretical expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在推理时存在过度思考（overthinking）问题，导致计算效率低下，而固定计算预算又可能引发欠思考（underthinking）。

Method: 提出BBAM理论模型和$E^3$指标，并基于此设计Plan-and-Budget框架，动态分解问题并分配计算资源。

Result: Plan-and-Budget显著提升效率，最高实现+70%准确率提升、-39%计算量减少和+187.5% $E^3$改进。

Conclusion: Plan-and-Budget无需重新训练即可提升模型效率，缩小小模型与大模型的性能差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex
reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We
observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where
models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple
queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token
budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder
problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often
stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a
theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models
reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and
introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and
computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose
Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex
queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated
complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning
efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy
gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it
elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger
model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close
performance gaps without retraining. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有IRM方法（如IRMv1）在OOD泛化中表现不佳，主要由于其惩罚项对环境多样性和过参数化敏感，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种外推框架，通过合成分布偏移增强IRM惩罚项，从而提升环境多样性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和实际场景中均优于现有IRM变体，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了IRM的OOD泛化能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Invariant risk minimization (IRM) aims to enable out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization in deep learning by learning invariant representations. As IRM
poses an inherently challenging bi-level optimization problem, most existing
approaches -- including IRMv1 -- adopt penalty-based single-level
approximations. However, empirical studies consistently show that these methods
often fail to outperform well-tuned empirical risk minimization (ERM),
highlighting the need for more robust IRM implementations. This work
theoretically identifies a key limitation common to many IRM variants: their
penalty terms are highly sensitive to limited environment diversity and
over-parameterization, resulting in performance degradation. To address this
issue, a novel extrapolation-based framework is proposed that enhances
environmental diversity by augmenting the IRM penalty through synthetic
distributional shifts. Extensive experiments -- ranging from synthetic setups
to realistic, over-parameterized scenarios -- demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IRM variants, validating its
effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: MMO-FL和PMM为物联网环境中的多模态学习提供了有效解决方案，特别是在模态缺失情况下表现优异。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal
data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As
edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple
data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational
tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning
strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment.
Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage
on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these
challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning
(MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal
learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account
for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in
missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive
theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios,
providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing
modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the
Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype
learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results
on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM
compared to benchmarks.

Abstract: Model merging offers a training-free alternative to multi-task learning by
combining independently fine-tuned models into a unified one without access to
raw data. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics to determine
the merging coefficients, limiting their scalability and generality. In this
work, we revisit model merging through the lens of least-squares optimization
and show that the optimal merging weights should scale with the amount of
task-specific information encoded in each model. Based on this insight, we
propose NAN, a simple yet effective method that estimates model merging
coefficients via the inverse of parameter norm. NAN is training-free,
plug-and-play, and applicable to a wide range of merging strategies. Extensive
experiments on show that NAN consistently improves performance of baseline
methods.

Conclusion: 模型在适度标注错误下仍能保持泛化能力，LIP为实际应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Learning from inaccurate annotations has gained significant attention due to
the high cost of precise labeling. However, despite the presence of erroneous
labels, models trained on noisy data often retain the ability to make accurate
predictions. This intriguing phenomenon raises a fundamental yet largely
unexplored question: why models can still extract correct label information
from inaccurate annotations remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive investigation into this issue. By analyzing weight matrices from
both empirical and theoretical perspectives, we find that label inaccuracy
primarily accumulates noise in lower singular components and subtly perturbs
the principal subspace. Within a certain range, the principal subspaces of
weights trained on inaccurate labels remain largely aligned with those learned
from clean labels, preserving essential task-relevant information. We formally
prove that the angles of principal subspaces exhibit minimal deviation under
moderate label inaccuracy, explaining why models can still generalize
effectively. Building on these insights, we propose LIP, a lightweight plug-in
designed to help classifiers retain principal subspace information while
mitigating noise induced by label inaccuracy. Extensive experiments on tasks
with various inaccuracy conditions demonstrate that LIP consistently enhances
the performance of existing algorithms. We hope our findings can offer valuable
theoretical and practical insights to understand of model robustness under
inaccurate supervision.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了数据异质性和声誉问题，优于无声誉机制的联邦学习方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds great promise for digital health by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising patient data privacy.
However, heterogeneity across institutions, lack of sustained reputation, and
unreliable contributions remain major challenges. In this paper, we propose a
robust, peer-driven reputation mechanism for federated healthcare that employs
a hybrid communication model to integrate decentralized peer feedback with
clustering-based noise handling to enhance model aggregation. Crucially, our
approach decouples the federated aggregation and reputation mechanisms by
applying differential privacy to client-side model updates before sharing them
for peer evaluation. This ensures sensitive information remains protected
during reputation computation, while unaltered updates are sent to the server
for global model training. Using the Cox Proportional Hazards model for
survival analysis across multiple federated nodes, our framework addresses both
data heterogeneity and reputation deficit by dynamically adjusting trust scores
based on local performance improvements measured via the concordance index.
Experimental evaluations on both synthetic datasets and the SEER dataset
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high and stable C-index
values, effectively down-weighing noisy client updates and outperforming FL
methods that lack a reputation system.

Method: 通过分析收敛方向，建立良性过拟合的充分条件，并研究测试误差的相变现象。

Result: 证明了在非正交数据设置下仍能实现良性过拟合，并在子高斯混合模型中验证其高概率发生。

Abstract: In this paper, we prove directional convergence of network parameters of
fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural networks optimized by gradient descent
with exponential loss, which was previously only known for gradient flow. By a
careful analysis of the convergent direction, we establish sufficient
conditions of benign overfitting and discover a new phase transition in the
test error bound. All of these results hold beyond the nearly orthogonal data
setting which was studied in prior works. As an application, we demonstrate
that benign overfitting occurs with high probability in sub-Gaussian mixture
models.

*Zhihang Cai,Xingjun Zhang,Zhendong Tan,Zheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NQKV算法通过分块量化KV缓存，显著减少内存消耗，提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理时KV缓存的内存消耗成为瓶颈，现有量化方法难以在低比特下保持精度。

Method: 分析KV缓存的元素分布，设计NQKV算法，采用分块量化方法。

Result: OPT模型推理时，批次大小增加2倍或上下文长度增加4倍，吞吐量提升9.3倍。

Conclusion: NQKV在低比特量化下保持模型质量，显著优化LLM部署效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across
a wide range of tasks. However, LLMs often require larger batch sizes to
enhance throughput or longer context lengths to meet task demands, which
significantly increases the memory resource consumption of the Key-Value (KV)
cache during inference, becoming a major bottleneck in LLM deployment. To
address this issue, quantization is a common and straightforward approach.
Currently, quantization methods for activations are limited to 8-bit, and
quantization to even lower bits can lead to substantial accuracy drops. To
further save space by quantizing the KV cache to even lower bits, we analyzed
the element distribution of the KV cache and designed the NQKV algorithm. Since
the elements within each block of the KV cache follow a normal distribution,
NQKV employs per-block quantile quantization to achieve
information-theoretically optimal quantization error. Without significantly
compromising model output quality, NQKV enables the OPT model to perform
inference with an 2x larger batch size or a 4x longer context length, and it
improves throughput by 9.3x compared to when the KV cache is not used.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文讨论了默认表示（DR），一种考虑奖励动态的表示方法，通过理论分析和实验验证，证明其比后继表示（SR）在奖励感知行为和性能上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后继表示（SR）在强化学习中虽广泛应用，但忽略了奖励动态。本文旨在研究默认表示（DR），以填补这一理论空白并验证其实际优势。

Method: 通过动态规划和时序差分方法学习DR，分析其向量空间基础，并将其扩展到函数近似情况。实验验证了DR在奖励塑造、选项发现、探索和迁移学习中的表现。

Result: DR表现出与SR不同的奖励感知行为，并在多个任务中实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: DR是一种更全面的表示方法，能够更好地处理奖励动态问题，为强化学习提供了新的工具。

Abstract: In recent years, the successor representation (SR) has attracted increasing
attention in reinforcement learning (RL), and it has been used to address some
of its key challenges, such as exploration, credit assignment, and
generalization. The SR can be seen as representing the underlying credit
assignment structure of the environment by implicitly encoding its induced
transition dynamics. However, the SR is reward-agnostic. In this paper, we
discuss a similar representation that also takes into account the reward
dynamics of the problem. We study the default representation (DR), a recently
proposed representation with limited theoretical (and empirical) analysis.
Here, we lay some of the theoretical foundation underlying the DR in the
tabular case by (1) deriving dynamic programming and (2) temporal-difference
methods to learn the DR, (3) characterizing the basis for the vector space of
the DR, and (4) formally extending the DR to the function approximation case
through default features. Empirically, we analyze the benefits of the DR in
many of the settings in which the SR has been applied, including (1) reward
shaping, (2) option discovery, (3) exploration, and (4) transfer learning. Our
results show that, compared to the SR, the DR gives rise to qualitatively
different, reward-aware behaviour and quantitatively better performance in
several settings.

Motivation: 研究TabPFN v2在开放环境中的表现，填补现有研究在开放环境挑战上的空白。

Method: 构建统一评估框架，涵盖多种现实挑战，评估TabPFN v2在开放环境中的鲁棒性。

Result: TabPFN v2在开放环境中表现有限，适合小规模、协变量偏移和类别平衡任务；树模型在开放环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立开放环境表格基准、多指标评估和通用模块以增强模型鲁棒性，并公开了评估框架。

Abstract: Tabular data, owing to its ubiquitous presence in real-world domains, has
garnered significant attention in machine learning research. While tree-based
models have long dominated tabular machine learning tasks, the recently
proposed deep learning model TabPFN v2 has emerged, demonstrating unparalleled
performance and scalability potential. Although extensive research has been
conducted on TabPFN v2 to further improve performance, the majority of this
research remains confined to closed environments, neglecting the challenges
that frequently arise in open environments. This raises the question: Can
TabPFN v2 maintain good performance in open environments? To this end, we
conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of TabPFN v2's adaptability in open
environments. We construct a unified evaluation framework covering various
real-world challenges and assess the robustness of TabPFN v2 under open
environments scenarios using this framework. Empirical results demonstrate that
TabPFN v2 shows significant limitations in open environments but is suitable
for small-scale, covariate-shifted, and class-balanced tasks. Tree-based models
remain the optimal choice for general tabular tasks in open environments. To
facilitate future research on open environments challenges, we advocate for
open environments tabular benchmarks, multi-metric evaluation, and universal
modules to strengthen model robustness. We publicly release our evaluation
framework at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tabpfn-ood-4E65.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于模型的离线强化学习框架（OGSRL），通过双重约束机制解决医疗场景中的OOD问题，确保策略的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗场景中，离线强化学习的OOD问题可能导致有害建议，现有方法（如CQL）仅约束动作选择，无法有效调控状态轨迹，限制了长期治疗策略的发现。

Method: OGSRL引入双重约束机制：1）OOD守护者限定临床验证的安全区域；2）安全成本约束编码生理安全边界。

Result: OGSRL在理论上保证了策略的安全性和近最优性，能够在安全区域内探索优于临床行为的策略。

Conclusion: OGSRL为医疗场景中的离线强化学习提供了安全可靠的解决方案，支持长期治疗策略的优化。

Abstract: When applying offline reinforcement learning (RL) in healthcare scenarios,
the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues pose significant risks, as inappropriate
generalization beyond clinical expertise can result in potentially harmful
recommendations. While existing methods like conservative Q-learning (CQL)
attempt to address the OOD issue, their effectiveness is limited by only
constraining action selection by suppressing uncertain actions. This
action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize
short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories,
thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To
safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that
state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \textit{Offline
Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically
grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel
dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety.
First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions
for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions,
it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform
clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without
drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a
safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological
safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where
training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we
provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that
satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve
performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data.

Conclusion: 该方法具有快速收敛和高效响应复杂系统状态的能力，显著提升了感知能力和协作调度性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of multi-node perception and delayed
scheduling response in distributed systems by proposing a GNN-based multi-node
collaborative perception mechanism. The system is modeled as a graph structure.
Message-passing and state-update modules are introduced. A multi-layer graph
neural network is constructed to enable efficient information aggregation and
dynamic state inference among nodes. In addition, a perception representation
method is designed by fusing local states with global features. This improves
each node's ability to perceive the overall system status. The proposed method
is evaluated within a customized experimental framework. A dataset featuring
heterogeneous task loads and dynamic communication topologies is used.
Performance is measured in terms of task completion rate, average latency, load
balancing, and transmission efficiency. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms mainstream algorithms under various conditions,
including limited bandwidth and dynamic structural changes. It demonstrates
superior perception capabilities and cooperative scheduling performance. The
model achieves rapid convergence and efficient responses to complex system
states.

Conclusion: 研究为数据归因和数据集选择提供了实用指导，支持代理模型在大规模场景中的应用。

Abstract: Choice of training data distribution greatly influences model behavior. Yet,
in large-scale settings, precisely characterizing how changes in training data
affects predictions is often difficult due to model training costs. Current
practice is to instead extrapolate from scaled down, inexpensive-to-train proxy
models. However, changes in data do not influence smaller and larger models
identically. Therefore, understanding how choice of data affects large-scale
models raises the question: how does training data distribution influence model
behavior across compute scale? We find that small- and large-scale language
model predictions (generally) do highly correlate across choice of training
data. Equipped with these findings, we characterize how proxy scale affects
effectiveness in two downstream proxy model applications: data attribution and
dataset selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Bradley-Terry奖励模型（BT RM）对数据规模和覆盖敏感且易受奖励攻击，现有生成式奖励模型（GenRM）推理能力有限且与标准RLHF算法不兼容。

Method: 提出Think-RM框架，通过监督微调（SFT）和规则强化学习（RL）训练模型生成自引导推理轨迹，并设计成对RLHF流程直接优化策略。

Result: Think-RM在RM-Bench上表现优于BT RM和垂直扩展GenRM 8%，结合成对RLHF流程后策略性能更优。

Conclusion: Think-RM通过长时程推理和成对RLHF流程显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful
post-training paradigm for aligning large language models with human
preferences. A core challenge in RLHF is constructing accurate reward signals,
where the conventional Bradley-Terry reward models (BT RMs) often suffer from
sensitivity to data size and coverage, as well as vulnerability to reward
hacking. Generative reward models (GenRMs) offer a more robust alternative by
generating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales followed by a final reward.
However, existing GenRMs rely on shallow, vertically scaled reasoning, limiting
their capacity to handle nuanced or complex (e.g., reasoning-intensive) tasks.
Moreover, their pairwise preference outputs are incompatible with standard RLHF
algorithms that require pointwise reward signals. In this work, we introduce
Think-RM, a training framework that enables long-horizon reasoning in GenRMs by
modeling an internal thinking process. Rather than producing structured,
externally provided rationales, Think-RM generates flexible, self-guided
reasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection,
hypothetical reasoning, and divergent reasoning. To elicit these reasoning
abilities, we first warm-up the models by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over
long CoT data. We then further improve the model's long-horizon abilities by
rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). In addition, we propose a novel
pairwise RLHF pipeline that directly optimizes policies using pairwise
preference rewards, eliminating the need for pointwise reward conversion and
enabling more effective use of Think-RM outputs. Experiments show that Think-RM
achieves state-of-the-art results on RM-Bench, outperforming both BT RM and
vertically scaled GenRM by 8%. When combined with our pairwise RLHF pipeline,
it demonstrates superior end-policy performance compared to traditional
approaches.

Motivation: 探讨注意力机制的计算复杂度和表达能力之间的关系，特别是权重大小对避免层坍塌的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究权重大小与层坍塌的关系，并与现有关于跳跃连接的研究进行对比。

Result: 大权重是避免层坍塌的必要条件，而跳跃连接无法解决这一问题。二次时间计算在表达能力强的变换器中不可避免。

Conclusion: 权重大小是决定注意力机制表达能力的关键因素，跳跃连接不足以防止层坍塌，大权重是必要的。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms lie at the heart of modern large language models (LLMs).
Straightforward algorithms for forward and backward (gradient) computation take
quadratic time, and a line of work initiated by [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2023]
and [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2024] has shown that quadratic time is necessary
unless the model weights are small, in which case almost linear time algorithms
are possible. In this paper, we show that large weights are necessary to avoid
a strong preclusion to representational strength we call layer collapse, which
means that the entire network can be approximated well by a network with only a
single layer. Thus, the quadratic running time of attention is unavoidable for
expressive transformers.
  The notion of layer collapse that we introduce is a variant on the notion of
rank collapse from the work of [Dong, Cordonnier, and Loukas ICML 2021]. They
showed that in Self Attention Networks with small weights and with skip
connections, rank collapse must occur. This is typically interpreted as
justifying the necessity of skip connections in expressive networks. However,
our result shows that even with skip connections, if the weights are small,
then layer collapse still occurs. Thus, only large weights, and not skip
connections, can prevent these representational weaknesses.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has emerged as a central issue in ML, and it has become
standard practice to adjust ML algorithms so that they will satisfy fairness
requirements such as Equal Opportunity. In this paper we consider the effects
of adopting such fair classifiers on the overall level of ecosystem fairness.
Specifically, we introduce the study of fairness with competing firms, and
demonstrate the failure of fair classifiers in yielding fair ecosystems. Our
results quantify the loss of fairness in systems, under a variety of
conditions, based on classifiers' correlation and the level of their data
overlap. We show that even if competing classifiers are individually fair, the
ecosystem's outcome may be unfair; and that adjusting biased algorithms to
improve their individual fairness may lead to an overall decline in ecosystem
fairness. In addition to these theoretical results, we also provide supporting
experimental evidence. Together, our model and results provide a novel and
essential call for action.

Motivation: 现有贝叶斯CPD方法因高维矩阵求逆问题难以扩展到大张量，需要一种更高效的算法。

Method: 利用广义近似消息传递（GAMP）避免矩阵求逆，并结合期望最大化（EM）推断张量秩和噪声功率。

Result: 在100x100x100秩20的张量上，仅观察20%元素时，运行时间减少82.7%，重建精度相当。

Conclusion: CP-GAMP是一种高效且准确的贝叶斯CPD算法，适用于大规模张量重建。

Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for
tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled
uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing
methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix
inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD
algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing
(GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization
routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple
experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements
observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the
state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable
reconstruction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用‘all-to-all’范式，无法区分变量间的因果影响，导致虚假相关性干扰预测。

Method: 构建结构因果模型，将历史序列分为四个子段（内生、直接因果、共因因果、虚假相关），仅使用前三个因果相关子段进行预测，并提出CAIFormer模型处理这些子段。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了CAIFormer的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过区分因果角色并排除虚假相关性，CAIFormer显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Most existing multivariate time series forecasting methods adopt an
all-to-all paradigm that feeds all variable histories into a unified model to
predict their future values without distinguishing their individual roles.
However, this undifferentiated paradigm makes it difficult to identify
variable-specific causal influences and often entangles causally relevant
information with spurious correlations. To address this limitation, we propose
an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable
separately. Specifically, we first construct a Structural Causal Model from
observational data and then, for each target variable, we partition the
historical sequence into four sub-segments according to the inferred causal
structure: endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious
correlation. The prediction relies solely on the first three causally relevant
sub-segments, while the spurious correlation sub-segment is excluded.
Furthermore, we propose Causal Informed Transformer (CAIFormer), a novel
forecasting model comprising three components: Endogenous Sub-segment
Prediction Block, Direct Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, and Collider
Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, which process the endogenous, direct
causal, and collider causal sub-segments, respectively. Their outputs are then
combined to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CAIFormer.

Motivation: 零售业中准确的需求估计对库存和定价策略至关重要，但缺货时的销售数据截断导致系统性偏差，现有数据集无法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两阶段需求建模方法：首先利用精确的小时级标注重建缺货期间的潜在需求，然后利用恢复的需求训练鲁棒的预测模型。

Conclusion: FreshRetailNet-50K为需求填补、易腐品库存优化和零售因果分析开辟了新方向，解决了零售AI中长期存在的限制。

Abstract: Accurate demand estimation is critical for the retail business in guiding the
inventory and pricing policies of perishable products. However, it faces
fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where
unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the
temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To
fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark
for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series
of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing
863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly
stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual
covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal
features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate
one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the
latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then
leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the
second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73\%
improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand
underestimation from 7.37\% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal
granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens
new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory
optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and
scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing
immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation. The
data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-50K) and code

Motivation: 传统随机采样方法导致训练数据不平衡，过度训练简单样本而忽视困难样本，影响模型性能。

Method: AdaSTaR引入两种自适应采样原则：多样性采样（平衡训练数据）和课程采样（动态调整数据难度）。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，AdaSTaR均取得最佳测试准确率，训练FLOPs平均减少58.6%。

Conclusion: AdaSTaR为高效、有效的自我改进语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of
self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism
often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in
trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples
while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive
STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two
adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting
balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for
Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving
strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all
instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an
extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency
generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for
more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

Method: 提出DEX方法，通过复用softmax注意力分数并添加轻量级差分操作，整合差分注意力的优势。

Result: DEX显著提升了预训练模型在多个基准测试中的性能，且仅需极少量适应数据。

Conclusion: DEX高效整合了差分注意力的优势，为预训练模型提供了轻量级改进方案。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its
impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform
noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention
achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover,
Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from
scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three
key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative
attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved
learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to
efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained
language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a
lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively
incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining
lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX
substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving
significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01\%).

*Yunhui Jang,Jaehyung Kim,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLEANMOL框架通过设计确定性任务提升LLMs对SMILES分子结构的理解能力，并在Mol-Instructions基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在解析SMILES分子结构时表现不佳，无法完成基本任务（如计数分子环），需要改进。

Method: 提出CLEANMOL框架，将SMILES解析转化为一系列确定性任务，包括子图匹配和全局图匹配，并提供结构化监督。

Result: CLEANMOL不仅提升了结构理解能力，还在Mol-Instructions基准测试中达到或超越基线水平。

Conclusion: CLEANMOL有效解决了LLMs在分子结构理解上的局限性，为科学发现提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools
for scientific discovery, particularly in molecular science. A fundamental
requirement for these models is the ability to accurately understand molecular
structures, commonly encoded in the SMILES representation. However, current
LLMs struggle to interpret SMILES, even failing to carry out basic tasks such
as counting molecular rings. To address this limitation, we introduce CLEANMOL,
a novel framework that formulates SMILES parsing into a suite of clean and
deterministic tasks explicitly designed to promote graph-level molecular
comprehension. These tasks span from subgraph matching to global graph
matching, providing structured supervision aligned with molecular structural
properties. We construct a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive
difficulty scoring and pre-train open-source LLMs on these tasks. Our results
show that CLEANMOL not only enhances structural comprehension but also achieves
the best or competes with the baseline on the Mol-Instructions benchmark.

Motivation: 研究长尾半监督学习中的分布不匹配问题，现有方法未能充分利用不同专家的优势。

Method: 提出动态专家分配模块和多深度特征融合模块，动态分配专家并融合不同深度特征。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-LT、STL-10-LT和SVHN-LT数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过动态专家分配和多深度特征融合，显著提升了长尾半监督学习的性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) with
distribution mismatch, where the class distribution of the labeled training
data follows a long-tailed distribution and mismatches with that of the
unlabeled training data. Most existing methods introduce auxiliary classifiers
(experts) to model various unlabeled data distributions and produce
pseudo-labels, but the expertises of various experts are not fully utilized. We
observe that different experts are good at predicting different intervals of
samples, e.g., long-tailed expert is skilled in samples located in the head
interval and uniform expert excels in samples located in the medium interval.
Therefore, we propose a dynamic expert assignment module that can estimate the
class membership (i.e., head, medium, or tail class) of samples, and
dynamically assigns suitable expert to each sample based on the estimated
membership to produce high-quality pseudo-label in the training phase and
produce prediction in the testing phase. We also theoretically reveal that
integrating different experts' strengths will lead to a smaller generalization
error bound. Moreover, we find that the deeper features are more biased toward
the head class but with more discriminative ability, while the shallower
features are less biased but also with less discriminative ability. We,
therefore, propose a multi-depth feature fusion module to utilize different
depth features to mitigate the model bias. Our method demonstrates its
effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT,
and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings. The code is available at

Result: 证明平衡到达控制策略能保持准可逆性，并推导出稳态测度的形式。

Conclusion: 平衡到达控制策略适用于准可逆排队系统，为优化和强化学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a versatile scheme for optimizing the arrival
rates of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We first propose an alternative
definition of quasi-reversibility that encompasses reversibility and highlights
the importance of the definition of customer classes. In a second time, we
introduce balanced arrival control policies, which generalize the notion of
balanced arrival rates introduced in the context of Whittle networks, to the
much broader class of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We prove that
supplementing a quasi-reversible queueing system with a balanced
arrival-control policy preserves the quasi-reversibility, and we specify the
form of the stationary measures. We revisit two canonical examples of
quasi-reversible queueing systems, Whittle networks and order-independent
queues. Lastly, we focus on the problem of admission control and leverage our
results in the frameworks of optimization and reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: AdamS是一种替代Adam的优化器，通过新颖的分母设计（动量与当前梯度的平方加权和的根）简化计算，适用于大语言模型预训练和后训练，性能优越且易于集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer目标的局部平滑性观察，提出AdamS以简化优化过程并提升效率。

Method: 利用动量和当前梯度的平方加权和的根作为分母，避免二阶矩估计，保持与SGD相似的计算和内存开销。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama2等任务中表现优异，支持大规模模型训练，理论收敛性得到验证。

Conclusion: AdamS以其高效性、简单性和理论支持，成为现有优化器的有力替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce AdamS, a simple yet effective alternative to Adam for large
language model (LLM) pretraining and post-training. By leveraging a novel
denominator, i.e., the root of weighted sum of squares of the momentum and the
current gradient, AdamS eliminates the need for second-moment estimates. Hence,
AdamS is efficient, matching the memory and compute footprint of SGD with
momentum while delivering superior optimization performance. Moreover, AdamS is
easy to adopt: it can directly inherit hyperparameters of AdamW, and is
entirely model-agnostic, integrating seamlessly into existing pipelines without
modifications to optimizer APIs or architectures. The motivation behind AdamS
stems from the observed $(L_0, L_1)$ smoothness properties in transformer
objectives, where local smoothness is governed by gradient magnitudes that can
be further approximated by momentum magnitudes. We establish rigorous
theoretical convergence guarantees and provide practical guidelines for
hyperparameter selection. Empirically, AdamS demonstrates strong performance in
various tasks, including pre-training runs on GPT-2 and Llama2 (up to 13B
parameters) and reinforcement learning in post-training regimes. With its
efficiency, simplicity, and theoretical grounding, AdamS stands as a compelling
alternative to existing optimizers.

Conclusion: CoCoGraph高效且实用，生成了820万分子数据库，并通过专家评估验证了其可行性和局限性。

Abstract: Developing new molecular compounds is crucial to address pressing challenges,
from health to environmental sustainability. However, exploring the molecular
space to discover new molecules is difficult due to the vastness of the space.
Here we introduce CoCoGraph, a collaborative and constrained graph diffusion
model capable of generating molecules that are guaranteed to be chemically
valid. Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative
mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard
benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates
molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current
models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M
million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with
organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated
molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL任务在可扩展性、可验证性和难度控制上存在局限性，限制了LLM推理能力的开发。

Method: 提出Saturn框架，基于SAT问题设计课程学习流程，支持可扩展任务构建、规则验证和精确难度控制。

Result: Saturn-1.5B和Saturn-7B在SAT、数学和编程任务上表现显著提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Saturn为LLM推理能力的开发提供了高效框架，并在多个任务上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question.
Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks)
suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human
annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2)
Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3)
Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control,
making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.
  To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework
that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM
reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification,
and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline
that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks
of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable
training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.
  We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying
difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with
problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain
Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT
problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of
+14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B
and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g.,
AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in
constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We
release the source code, data, and models to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型的可解释性和可重用性问题，传统嵌入模型缺乏透明度，而Tsetlin Machine虽可解释但扩展性不足。

Method: 提出Omni TM-AE，利用TM状态矩阵的全部信息（包括之前被排除的文字），通过单次训练生成嵌入。

Result: 在语义相似性、情感分类和文档聚类任务中表现优于主流嵌入模型。

Conclusion: Omni TM-AE证明可以在性能、可扩展性和可解释性之间取得平衡，无需依赖不透明的架构。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large-scale language models has amplified
concerns regarding their interpretability and reusability. While traditional
embedding models like Word2Vec and GloVe offer scalability, they lack
transparency and often behave as black boxes. Conversely, interpretable models
such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) have shown promise in constructing explainable
learning systems, though they previously faced limitations in scalability and
reusability. In this paper, we introduce Omni Tsetlin Machine AutoEncoder (Omni
TM-AE), a novel embedding model that fully exploits the information contained
in the TM's state matrix, including literals previously excluded from clause
formation. This method enables the construction of reusable, interpretable
embeddings through a single training phase. Extensive experiments across
semantic similarity, sentiment classification, and document clustering tasks
show that Omni TM-AE performs competitively with and often surpasses mainstream
embedding models. These results demonstrate that it is possible to balance
performance, scalability, and interpretability in modern Natural Language
Processing (NLP) systems without resorting to opaque architectures.

TL;DR: 大规模强化学习（RL）可以显著提升中小型模型的推理能力，超越基于蒸馏的最先进模型。通过数学和代码提示的分阶段训练，以及高质量数据收集，RL不仅提升了数学和代码任务的表现，还挖掘了模型的潜在推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模RL在推理任务上取得进展，但训练方法仍不明确。前沿模型的实现细节（如数据策略和RL训练方法）常被忽略，且蒸馏在小模型上仍更有效。本研究旨在证明大规模RL对中小型模型的推理能力提升作用。

Method: 分阶段RL训练：先数学提示训练，后代码提示训练。开发高质量数据收集管道，支持验证式RL。实验包括逐步增加响应长度的课程学习和策略参数更新的稳定效果。

Result: 数学RL显著提升数学和代码任务表现（如AIME 2025提升14.6%/17.2%，LiveCodeBench提升6.8%/5.8%）。代码RL进一步优化代码任务表现，数学任务无退化。

Conclusion: RL不仅能激发预训练和监督微调（如蒸馏）中获得的推理能力，还能突破模型原有极限，解决之前无法解决的问题。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for
reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models
remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as
DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are
often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more
effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that
large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong,
small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of
state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL
training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective
approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts.
Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the
performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% /
+17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks
(e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition,
extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks
with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data
curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable
answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains.
Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning
with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of
on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational
reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning
(e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning
ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多场景游戏中，规则和环境的多样性导致策略难以泛化，传统方法训练不稳定且性能差。

Method: Divide-Fuse-Conquer框架：分组游戏、训练专用模型、融合参数并继续训练。

Result: 在18个TextArena游戏中，Qwen2.5-32B-Align表现接近Claude3.5，取得7胜4平。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升LLMs在多场景强化学习中的泛化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to suddenly exhibit advanced
reasoning abilities during reinforcement learning (RL), resembling an ``aha
moment'' triggered by simple outcome-based rewards. While RL has proven
effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics,
coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games.
The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities
often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to
generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training
introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor
performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a
framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This
approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such
as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group
to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we
fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue
training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are
conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align
trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level
comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can
inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the
generalization of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的协作特性使其容易受到本地数据或模型更新的投毒攻击，现有攻击多导致拒绝服务问题，缺乏精确控制攻击效果的方法。

Method: 结合滑动模式控制（SMC）理论与模型投毒攻击，通过恶意客户端更新驱动全局模型向受损状态发展，精确控制攻击速率和收敛界限。

Result: 实验表明，FedSA能以较少恶意客户端精确实现预定义全局精度目标，同时保持高隐蔽性和可调学习率。

Conclusion: FedSA为联邦学习攻击提供了一种可控且隐蔽的新方法，能够精确实现攻击目标。

Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning
attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the
federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to
manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS)
issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated
Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the
extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a
predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by
10\%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC)
theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from
malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state,
achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging
the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the
convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the
poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious
clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning
rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的跨模态推理能力强大，但扩展的输入空间引入了新的攻击面。传统的显式攻击容易被检测和阻止，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 使用最低有效位隐写术将恶意指令嵌入图像，结合无害的文本提示；通过对抗性后缀和模板优化模块提升攻击效果。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5 Pro等商业模型上，攻击成功率超过90%，平均仅需3次查询。

Conclusion: IJA框架展示了隐式攻击的高效性和隐蔽性，突显了MLLMs在安全防御上的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable powerful cross-modal
reasoning capabilities. However, the expanded input space introduces new attack
surfaces. Previous jailbreak attacks often inject malicious instructions from
text into less aligned modalities, such as vision. As MLLMs increasingly
incorporate cross-modal consistency and alignment mechanisms, such explicit
attacks become easier to detect and block. In this work, we propose a novel
implicit jailbreak framework termed IJA that stealthily embeds malicious
instructions into images via least significant bit steganography and couples
them with seemingly benign, image-related textual prompts. To further enhance
attack effectiveness across diverse MLLMs, we incorporate adversarial suffixes
generated by a surrogate model and introduce a template optimization module
that iteratively refines both the prompt and embedding based on model feedback.
On commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro, our method achieves attack
success rates of over 90% using an average of only 3 queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准VAE的高斯先验假设限制了潜在变量之间的相关性捕捉，而GPVAE虽然通过高斯过程先验解决了这一问题，但大规模计算成本高昂，现有方法通常依赖限制性核假设或大量诱导点。

Method: 提出了一种邻居驱动的近似策略，通过将计算限制在每个数据点的最近邻范围内，保留潜在依赖关系，同时减少对大量诱导点的需求。

Result: 在表示学习、数据填补和条件生成等任务中，该方法在预测性能和计算效率上均优于其他GPVAE变体。

Conclusion: 邻居驱动的近似策略为GPVAE提供了一种高效且灵活的推断方法，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by
replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby
capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact
GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often
forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large
sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven
approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to
achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest
neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent
dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for
numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including
representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we
demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both
predictive performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Topic models often fail to capture low-prevalence, domain-critical themes,
so-called minority topics, such as mental health themes in online comments.
While some existing methods can incorporate domain knowledge, such as expected
topical content, methods allowing guidance may require overly detailed expected
topics, hindering the discovery of topic divisions and variation. We propose a
topic modeling solution via a specially constrained NMF. We incorporate a seed
word list characterizing minority content of interest, but we do not require
experts to pre-specify their division across minority topics. Through
prevalence constraints on minority topics and seed word content across topics,
we learn distinct data-driven minority topics as well as majority topics. The
constrained NMF is fitted via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with
multiplicative updates. We outperform several baselines on synthetic data in
terms of topic purity, normalized mutual information, and also evaluate topic
quality using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD). We conduct a case study on
YouTube vlog comments, analyzing viewer discussion of mental health content;
our model successfully identifies and reveals this domain-relevant minority
content.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在公平性目标下，需要在两种自然且可实现的准确性概念之间做出选择。

Abstract: We revisit the foundations of fairness and its interplay with utility and
efficiency in settings where the training data contain richer labels, such as
individual types, rankings, or risk estimates, rather than just binary
outcomes. In this context, we propose algorithms that achieve stronger notions
of evidence-based fairness than are possible in standard supervised learning.
Our methods support classification and ranking techniques that preserve
accurate subpopulation classification rates, as suggested by the underlying
data distributions, across a broad class of classification rules and downstream
applications. Furthermore, our predictors enable loss minimization, whether
aimed at maximizing utility or in the service of fair treatment.
  Complementing our algorithmic contributions, we present impossibility results
demonstrating that simultaneously achieving accurate classification rates and
optimal loss minimization is, in some cases, computationally infeasible. Unlike
prior impossibility results, our notions are not inherently in conflict and are
simultaneously satisfied by the Bayes-optimal predictor. Furthermore, we show
that each notion can be satisfied individually via efficient learning. Our
separation thus stems from the computational hardness of learning a
sufficiently good approximation of the Bayes-optimal predictor. These

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出PKeX-Shapley算法，利用乘积核的结构精确计算Shapley值，提升核方法的可解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法因其灵活性和表达能力被广泛应用，但其黑盒特性限制了在高风险场景中的使用，需提升可解释性。

Method: 利用乘积核的乘法结构，提出PKeX-Shapley算法，通过函数分解递归计算Shapley值。

Result: 算法能在多项式时间内精确计算Shapley值，并推广到解释核基统计差异（如MMD和HSIC）。

Conclusion: PKeX-Shapley为核方法提供了高效且可解释的工具，适用于统计推断。

Abstract: Kernel methods are widely used in machine learning due to their flexibility
and expressive power. However, their black-box nature poses significant
challenges to interpretability, limiting their adoption in high-stakes
applications. Shapley value-based feature attribution techniques, such as SHAP
and kernel-specific variants like RKHS-SHAP, offer a promising path toward
explainability. Yet, computing exact Shapley values remains computationally
intractable in general, motivating the development of various approximation
schemes. In this work, we introduce PKeX-Shapley, a novel algorithm that
utilizes the multiplicative structure of product kernels to enable the exact
computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. We show that product-kernel
models admit a functional decomposition that allows for a recursive formulation
of Shapley values. This decomposition not only yields computational efficiency
but also enhances interpretability in kernel-based learning. We also
demonstrate how our framework can be generalized to explain kernel-based
statistical discrepancies such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), thus offering new tools for
interpretable statistical inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的关系数据库生成模型GRDM，通过图神经网络联合建模所有表，避免了固定顺序的限制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法局限于单表生成或固定顺序的自回归分解，限制了并行性和灵活性，并因条件独立性假设导致误差累积。

Method: 使用图表示关系数据库，提出Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM)，通过图神经网络联合去噪行属性并捕获表间依赖。

Result: 在六个真实关系数据库上的实验表明，GRDM在多跳表间相关性建模上显著优于自回归基线，单表保真度指标达到最优。

Conclusion: GRDM通过无顺序联合建模表间关系，克服了传统方法的局限性，实现了更高效和灵活的数据库生成。

Abstract: Building generative models for relational databases (RDBs) is important for
applications like privacy-preserving data release and augmenting real datasets.
However, most prior work either focuses on single-table generation or relies on
autoregressive factorizations that impose a fixed table order and generate
tables sequentially. This approach limits parallelism, restricts flexibility in
downstream applications like missing value imputation, and compounds errors due
to commonly made conditional independence assumptions. We propose a
fundamentally different approach: jointly modeling all tables in an RDB without
imposing any order. By using a natural graph representation of RDBs, we propose
the Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM). GRDM leverages a graph
neural network to jointly denoise row attributes and capture complex
inter-table dependencies. Extensive experiments on six real-world RDBs
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms autoregressive
baselines in modeling multi-hop inter-table correlations and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on single-table fidelity metrics.

Conclusion: HOFT和SHOFT是高效且性能优越的正交微调方法。

Abstract: Adaptation of foundation models using low-rank methods is a widespread
approach. Another way to adapt these models is to employ orthogonal fine-tuning
methods, which are less time and memory efficient despite their good
generalization properties. In this work, we propose Householder Orthogonal
Fine-tuning (HOFT), a novel orthogonal fine-tuning method that aims to
alleviate time and space complexity. Moreover, some theoretical properties of
the orthogonal fine-tuning paradigm are explored. From this exploration, Scaled
Householder Orthogonal Fine-tuning (SHOFT) is proposed. Both HOFT and SHOFT are
evaluated in downstream tasks, namely commonsense reasoning, machine
translation, subject-driven generation and mathematical reasoning. Compared
with state-of-the-art adaptation methods, HOFT and SHOFT show comparable or
better results.

Conclusion: 该方法通过时间一致性条件显著提升了数据效率和预测准确性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We address the problem of incremental sequence classification, where
predictions are updated as new elements in the sequence are revealed. Drawing
on temporal-difference learning from reinforcement learning, we identify a
temporal-consistency condition that successive predictions should satisfy. We
leverage this condition to develop a novel loss function for training
incremental sequence classifiers. Through a concrete example, we demonstrate
that optimizing this loss can offer substantial gains in data efficiency. We
apply our method to text classification tasks and show that it improves
predictive accuracy over competing approaches on several benchmark datasets. We
further evaluate our approach on the task of verifying large language model
generations for correctness in grade-school math problems. Our results show
that models trained with our method are better able to distinguish promising
generations from unpromising ones after observing only a few tokens.

Conclusion: 该方法为PDE学习提供了更通用的框架，显著提升了模型在不同空间中的适应性。

Abstract: The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial
differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of
spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in.
This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to
other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate-
and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call
``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning
approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the
formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately
generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the
performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley
reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by
in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical
experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions
across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one
space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different
dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据隐私和个性化服务需求的增加，边缘设备上的机器学习模型训练需求上升，但当前方法存在数据利用率低、训练效率不足的问题。

Method: Titan采用两阶段数据选择框架：粗粒度筛选候选数据集，细粒度选择最优数据批次；同时利用流水线技术并行执行数据选择和模型训练，避免资源冲突。

Result: 实验表明，Titan在真实边缘设备上实现了高达43%的训练时间减少和6.2%的最终精度提升，且系统开销较小。

Conclusion: Titan通过高效的数据选择和资源管理，显著提升了边缘设备上模型训练的效率和效果。

Abstract: The demand for machine learning (ML) model training on edge devices is
escalating due to data privacy and personalized service needs. However, we
observe that current on-device model training is hampered by the
under-utilization of on-device data, due to low training throughput, limited
storage and diverse data importance. To improve data resource utilization, we
propose a two-stage data selection framework {\sf Titan} to select the most
important data batch from streaming data for model training with guaranteed
efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in the first stage, {\sf Titan}
filters out a candidate dataset with potentially high importance in a
coarse-grained manner.In the second stage of fine-grained selection, we propose
a theoretically optimal data selection strategy to identify the data batch with
the highest model performance improvement to current training round. To further
enhance time-and-resource efficiency, {\sf Titan} leverages a pipeline to
co-execute data selection and model training, and avoids resource conflicts by
exploiting idle computing resources. We evaluate {\sf Titan} on real-world edge
devices and three representative edge computing tasks with diverse models and
data modalities. Empirical results demonstrate that {\sf Titan} achieves up to
$43\%$ reduction in training time and $6.2\%$ increase in final accuracy with
minor system overhead, such as data processing delay, memory footprint and
energy consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示微调LLM的安全隐患，挑战现有关于微调安全性的假设。

Method: 使用FAB攻击，通过元学习模拟下游微调，优化模型在微调后表现出恶意行为，同时保持微调前的正常表现。

Result: FAB攻击在多种LLM和三种目标行为（广告、拒绝、越狱）中有效，且对用户微调选择具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAB攻击暴露了LLM微调的新安全漏洞，强调了模型安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Finetuning openly accessible Large Language Models (LLMs) has become standard
practice for achieving task-specific performance improvements. Until now,
finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which
training on benign datasets led to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we
demonstrate for the first time that an adversary can create poisoned LLMs that
initially appear benign but exhibit malicious behaviors once finetuned by
downstream users. To this end, our proposed attack, FAB (Finetuning-Activated
Backdoor), poisons an LLM via meta-learning techniques to simulate downstream
finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of malicious behaviors in
the finetuned models. At the same time, the poisoned LLM is regularized to
retain general capabilities and to exhibit no malicious behaviors prior to
finetuning. As a result, when users finetune the seemingly benign model on
their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its hidden backdoor behavior. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three target
behaviors: unsolicited advertising, refusal, and jailbreakability.
Additionally, we show that FAB-backdoors are robust to various finetuning
choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler). Our
findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the security of finetuning,
revealing yet another critical attack vector exploiting the complexities of
LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了人机交互问题，提高了负荷预测的准确性和实用性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: The growing complexity of power systems has made accurate load forecasting
more important than ever. An increasing number of advanced load forecasting
methods have been developed. However, the static design of current methods
offers no mechanism for human-model interaction. As the primary users of
forecasting models, system operators often find it difficult to understand and
apply these advanced models, which typically requires expertise in artificial
intelligence (AI). This also prevents them from incorporating their experience
and real-world contextual understanding into the forecasting process. Recent
breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to
address this issue. By leveraging their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration
framework to bridge the gap between human operators and forecasting models. A
set of specialized agents is designed to perform different tasks in the
forecasting workflow and collaborate via a dedicated communication mechanism.
This framework embeds interactive mechanisms throughout the load forecasting
pipeline, reducing the technical threshold for non-expert users and enabling
the integration of human experience. Our experiments demonstrate that the
interactive load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved when users
provide proper insight in key stages. Our cost analysis shows that the
framework remains affordable, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 通过策略蒸馏和多样化数据集，可以显著提升代理在未见环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer setting in reinforcement learning, the goal
is to train an agent on a fixed set of training environments so that it can
generalise to similar, but unseen, testing environments. Previous work has
shown that policy distillation after training can sometimes produce a policy
that outperforms the original in the testing environments. However, it is not
yet entirely clear why that is, or what data should be used to distil the
policy. In this paper, we prove, under certain assumptions, a generalisation
bound for policy distillation after training. The theory provides two practical
insights: for improved generalisation, you should 1) train an ensemble of
distilled policies, and 2) distil it on as much data from the training
environments as possible. We empirically verify that these insights hold in
more general settings, when the assumptions required for the theory no longer
hold. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble of policies distilled on a
diverse dataset can generalise significantly better than the original agent.

Motivation: 探索如何利用p-CFEs训练分类器，以验证其是否能在保持原始标签准确性的同时减少偏见。

Method: 使用p-CFEs标记错误目标类来训练分类器，并评估其对未扰动输入的分类效果。

Result: 分类器不仅保持了高准确率，还显著减少了与虚假相关的偏见。

Conclusion: p-CFEs是一种有效的训练方法，能够提升分类器的鲁棒性和公平性。

Abstract: Plausible counterfactual explanations (p-CFEs) are perturbations that
minimally modify inputs to change classifier decisions while remaining
plausible under the data distribution. In this study, we demonstrate that
classifiers can be trained on p-CFEs labeled with induced \emph{incorrect}
target classes to classify unperturbed inputs with the original labels. While
previous studies have shown that such learning is possible with adversarial
perturbations, we extend this paradigm to p-CFEs. Interestingly, our
experiments reveal that learning from p-CFEs is even more effective: the
resulting classifiers achieve not only high in-distribution accuracy but also
exhibit significantly reduced bias with respect to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Causal discovery for dynamical systems poses a major challenge in fields
where active interventions are infeasible. Most methods used to investigate
these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic,
low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these
limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible
data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical
causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from
thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as
two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on
systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of
a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction
of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will
facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are
broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges. We
provide a user-friendly implementation and documentation on

Result: 实验表明，LR显著改善了潜在校准误差和重新校准模型的负对数似然。

Conclusion: LR是一种高效且能提供显式多变量密度函数的重新校准方法，适用于多种数据集。

Abstract: Reliably characterizing the full conditional distribution of a multivariate
response variable given a set of covariates is crucial for trustworthy
decision-making. However, misspecified or miscalibrated multivariate models may
yield a poor approximation of the joint distribution of the response variables,
leading to unreliable predictions and suboptimal decisions. Furthermore,
standard recalibration methods are primarily limited to univariate settings,
while conformal prediction techniques, despite generating multivariate
prediction regions with coverage guarantees, do not provide a full probability
density function. We address this gap by first introducing a novel notion of
latent calibration, which assesses probabilistic calibration in the latent
space of a conditional normalizing flow. Second, we propose latent
recalibration (LR), a novel post-hoc model recalibration method that learns a
transformation of the latent space with finite-sample bounds on latent
calibration. Unlike existing methods, LR produces a recalibrated distribution
with an explicit multivariate density function while remaining computationally
efficient. Extensive experiments on both tabular and image datasets show that
LR consistently improves latent calibration error and the negative
log-likelihood of the recalibrated models.

Motivation: 现有基于能量学习的“goodness”函数忽略了神经元间的相关性，限制了性能。本文旨在通过引入有效维度（ED）来改进这一缺陷。

Method: 提出维度压缩的“goodness”函数，优化ED以最小化噪声输入时的ED，同时最大化样本分布中的ED，无需负样本。

Result: 该方法在非反向传播方法中表现优异，噪声对泛化和推理有积极作用。

Conclusion: 该研究为生物合理性学习算法和神经形态计算提供了新思路，噪声被视为计算资源而非干扰。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to
backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise
"goodness" function to guide learning. Existing goodness functions, inspired by
energy-based learning (EBL), are typically defined as the sum of squared
post-synaptic activations, neglecting the correlations between neurons. In this
work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression
that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to
incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for
clamped inputs when noise is considered while maximizing it across the sample
distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare
negative samples. We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive
performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise
plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference
when predictions are derived from the mean of squared outputs, which is
equivalent to making predictions based on the energy term. Our findings
contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning
algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where
stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法在RUL预测中具有实际应用潜力，尤其在数据有限时仍保持稳健性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential for
enabling timely maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, impacting the operational
efficiency of electric applications that rely on them. This paper proposes a
RUL prediction approach that leverages data from recent charge-discharge cycles
to estimate the number of remaining usable cycles. The approach introduces both
a novel signal processing pipeline and a deep learning prediction model. In the
signal preprocessing pipeline, a derived capacity feature is computed based on
current and capacity signals. Alongside original capacity, voltage and current,
these features are denoised and enhanced using statistical metrics and a
delta-based method to capture differences between the current and previous
cycles. In the prediction model, the processed features are then fed into a
hybrid deep learning architecture composed of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (A-LSTM), and Ordinary Differential
Equation-based LSTM (ODE-LSTM) modules. This architecture is designed to
capture both local signal characteristics and long-range temporal dependencies
while modeling the continuous-time dynamics of battery degradation. The model
is further evaluated using transfer learning across different learning
strategies and target data partitioning scenarios. Results indicate that the
model maintains robust performance, even when fine-tuned on limited target
data. Experimental results on two publicly available large-scale datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a baseline deep learning
approach and machine learning techniques, achieving an RMSE of 101.59,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world RUL prediction applications.

analysis of three clustering approaches: (1) Classical K-Means Clustering,
applied to pre-processed feature representations; (2) Hybrid Clustering,
wherein classical features are enhanced with quantum random features extracted
using randomly initialized quantum neural networks (QNNs); and (3) Fully
Quantum Clustering, where a QNN is trained in a self-supervised manner
leveraging a SwAV-based loss function to optimize the feature space for

investigates the impact of quantum circuit depth and the number of learned
prototypes, demonstrating that even shallow quantum circuits can effectively
extract meaningful non-linear representations, significantly improving
clustering performance.

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，提出的采样策略能有效提升SSL模型在OOD任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过因果推断和PID约束，可以显著提升自监督学习的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of
self-supervised learning (SSL). By analyzing the mini-batch construction during
the SSL training phase, we first give one plausible explanation for SSL having
OOD generalization. Then, from the perspective of data generation and causal
inference, we analyze and conclude that SSL learns spurious correlations during
the training process, which leads to a reduction in OOD generalization. To
address this issue, we propose a post-intervention distribution (PID) grounded
in the Structural Causal Model. PID offers a scenario where the spurious
variable and label variable is mutually independent. Besides, we demonstrate
that if each mini-batch during SSL training satisfies PID, the resulting SSL
model can achieve optimal worst-case OOD performance. This motivates us to
develop a batch sampling strategy that enforces PID constraints through the
learning of a latent variable model. Through theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate the identifiability of the latent variable model and validate the

TL;DR: 提出一种基于对比学习的方法，用于分析基因组测序数据，通过训练编码器模型生成嵌入表示，适用于多种下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组测序产生的短序列需要重组，传统方法复杂且耗时，因此需要一种更高效的方法来分析这类数据。

Method: 使用对比学习训练编码器模型，生成能够聚类相同基因组区域序列的嵌入表示，并保留序列的空间轨迹。

Result: 模型在模拟古DNA（aDNA）映射和结构变异识别中表现良好，与当前黄金标准方法BWA-aln在准确性和运行时间上相当。

Conclusion: 该方法具有较好的扩展性，适用于宏基因组物种识别和大规模基因组分析，无需依赖完整的基因组组装。

Abstract: Sequencing a genome to determine an individual's DNA produces an enormous
number of short nucleotide subsequences known as reads, which must be
reassembled to reconstruct the full genome. We present a method for analyzing
this type of data using contrastive learning, in which an encoder model is
trained to produce embeddings that cluster together sequences from the same
genomic region. The sequential nature of genomic regions is preserved in the
form of trajectories through this embedding space. Trained solely to reflect
the structure of the genome, the resulting model provides a general
representation of $k$-mer sequences, suitable for a range of downstream tasks
involving read data. We apply our framework to learn the structure of the $E.\
coli$ genome, and demonstrate its use in simulated ancient DNA (aDNA) read
mapping and identification of structural variations. Furthermore, we illustrate
the potential of using this type of model for metagenomic species
identification. We show how incorporating a domain-specific noise model can
enhance embedding robustness, and how a supervised contrastive learning setting
can be adopted when a linear reference genome is available, by introducing a
distance thresholding parameter $\Gamma$. The model can also be trained fully
self-supervised on read data, enabling analysis without the need to construct a
full genome assembly using specialized algorithms. Small prediction heads based
on a pre-trained embedding are shown to perform on par with BWA-aln, the
current gold standard approach for aDNA mapping, in terms of accuracy and
runtime for short genomes. Given the method's favorable scaling properties with
respect to total genome size, inference using our approach is highly promising
for metagenomic applications and for mapping to genomes comparable in size to
the human genome.

Motivation: 后训练语言模型（PoLM）常因过度自信而影响可靠性，但下游任务的标注数据稀缺，难以直接校准。

Method: 提出DACA方法，通过选择性使用一致性样本进行温度缩放校准，避免因预测不一致导致的校准偏差。

Result: 实验表明，DACA显著提升了校准性能，平均ECE指标在多个基准上提升高达15.08%。

Conclusion: DACA是一种有效的无监督校准方法，能够显著改善PoLM的可靠性。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks.
While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language
models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to
both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical
applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled
data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose
Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to
optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence
calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by
prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their
confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence
underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a
larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by
selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively
decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an
overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples,
improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and
API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

Motivation: CBMs通过人类可解释的概念分解预测，但训练用的标注噪声对其影响尚未充分理解。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：训练时使用锐度感知最小化稳定噪声敏感概念的学习；推理时通过预测熵排序并修正最不确定的概念。

Result: 分析表明，噪声显著影响性能，而提出的框架能有效提升鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 锐度感知训练和基于不确定性的修正为CBMs在噪声环境中的稳定性和可解释性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) ensure interpretability by decomposing
predictions into human interpretable concepts. Yet the annotations used for
training CBMs that enable this transparency are often noisy, and the impact of
such corruption is not well understood. In this study, we present the first
systematic study of noise in CBMs and show that even moderate corruption
simultaneously impairs prediction performance, interpretability, and the
intervention effectiveness. Our analysis identifies a susceptible subset of
concepts whose accuracy declines far more than the average gap between noisy
and clean supervision and whose corruption accounts for most performance loss.
To mitigate this vulnerability we propose a two-stage framework. During
training, sharpness-aware minimization stabilizes the learning of
noise-sensitive concepts. During inference, where clean labels are unavailable,
we rank concepts by predictive entropy and correct only the most uncertain
ones, using uncertainty as a proxy for susceptibility. Theoretical analysis and
extensive ablations elucidate why sharpness-aware training confers robustness
and why uncertainty reliably identifies susceptible concepts, providing a
principled basis that preserves both interpretability and resilience in the
presence of noise.

*Wenhao Li,Yuxin Zhang,Gen Luo,Daohai Yu,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了SeCO和SpaCO两种内存高效的训练方法，用于优化长上下文大语言模型的训练成本。SeCO通过分块处理输入降低内存需求，SpaCO进一步通过选择性梯度传播减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型的训练成本过高，限制了其定制化应用。

Method: SeCO将长输入分块处理，每块独立构建计算图并进行局部反向传播；SpaCO在此基础上选择性传播梯度并引入补偿因子。

Result: SeCO将最大序列长度从1K扩展到16K，SpaCO在相同实验条件下训练速度比SeCO快3倍。

Conclusion: SeCO和SpaCO为优化长上下文模型提供了新思路，使其更适用于实际应用。

Abstract: While long-context large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable document
processing capabilities, their prohibitively high training costs often hinder
customized applications. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textit{Sequential
Chunk-wise Optimization} (SeCO), a memory-efficient training paradigm that
partitions lengthy inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk independently
constructs its computational graph and performs localized backpropagation,
ensuring that only one chunk's forward activations are stored in memory.
Building on SeCO, we further introduce \textit{Sparse Chunk-wise Optimization}
(SpaCO), which reduces computational overhead by selectively propagating
gradients to specific chunks and incorporates a carefully designed compensation
factor to ensure unbiased gradient estimation. SpaCO decouples the
computational cost of backpropagation from the context length, enabling
training time to gradually converge to inference time as sequences become
longer. Implemented as lightweight training wrappers, both SeCO and SpaCO offer
substantial practical benefits. For example, when fine-tuning an 8B model with
LoRA on a single RTX 3090 GPU, SeCO expands maximum sequence length from 1K to
16K tokens, while SpaCO demonstrates accelerated training speed -- achieving up
to 3x faster than SeCO under the same experimental setup. These innovations
provide new insights into optimizing long-context models, making them more
accessible for practical applications. We have open-sourced the code at
\href{https://github.com/wenhaoli-xmu/seco}{here}.

Conclusion: LaBraM++具有优越性能和训练效率，为未来LBM发展提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained Electroencephalogram (EEG) models
have shown great promise, driving progress in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
and healthcare applications. However, despite their success, many existing
pre-trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content
of neural oscillations, a limitation that fundamentally constrains their
performance and generalizability across diverse BCI tasks. This limitation is
frequently rooted in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain
their representational capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an
enhanced Large Brainwave Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled
improvements grounded in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++
demonstrates substantial gains across a variety of tasks, consistently
outperforming its originally-based architecture and achieving competitive
results when compared to other open-source LBMs. Its superior performance and
training efficiency highlight its potential as a strong foundation for future
advancements in LBMs.

Abstract: Datasets in engineering domains are often small, sparsely labeled, and
contain numerical as well as categorical conditions. Additionally.
computational resources are typically limited in practical applications which
hinders the adoption of generative models for engineering tasks. We introduce a
novel masked-conditioning approach, that enables generative models to work with
sparse, mixed-type data. We mask conditions during training to simulate sparse
conditions at inference time. For this purpose, we explore the use of various
sparsity schedules that show different strengths and weaknesses. In addition,
we introduce a flexible embedding that deals with categorical as well as
numerical conditions. We integrate our method into an efficient variational
autoencoder as well as a latent diffusion model and demonstrate the
applicability of our approach on two engineering-related datasets of 2D point
clouds and images. Finally, we show that small models trained on limited data
can be coupled with large pretrained foundation models to improve generation
quality while retaining the controllability induced by our conditioning scheme.

Method: 将策略学习建模为非马尔可夫Feynman-Kac模型中的概率推断，开发了一种嵌套顺序蒙特卡洛（SMC）算法来估计历史依赖的策略梯度。

Result: 在标准连续POMDP基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有方法，尤其在不确定性下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架通过内在地捕捉信息收集的价值，无需外部探索奖励或启发式方法，为POMDP中的决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires agents to
balance reducing uncertainty (exploration) against pursuing immediate
objectives (exploitation). In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
optimization framework for continuous partially observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) that explicitly addresses this challenge. Our method casts
policy learning as probabilistic inference in a non-Markovian Feynman--Kac
model that inherently captures the value of information gathering by
anticipating future observations, without requiring extrinsic exploration
bonuses or handcrafted heuristics. To optimize policies under this model, we
develop a nested sequential Monte Carlo~(SMC) algorithm that efficiently
estimates a history-dependent policy gradient under samples from the optimal
trajectory distribution induced by the POMDP. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our algorithm across standard continuous POMDP benchmarks, where existing
methods struggle to act under uncertainty.

Result: FoD在图像恢复和无条件生成任务中表现优异，证明了其高效性。

Conclusion: FoD是一种简单但有效的生成建模框架，具有竞争力和实用性。

Abstract: This work presents a forward-only diffusion (FoD) approach for generative
modelling. In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled
forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through
a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative
framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential
equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion
functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean
data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target
distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained
using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step
non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its
simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned
(e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generative modelling. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 通过促进简单行为，该方法显著提升了强化学习的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Simplicity is a powerful inductive bias. In reinforcement learning,
regularization is used for simpler policies, data augmentation for simpler
representations, and sparse reward functions for simpler objectives, all that,
with the underlying motivation to increase generalizability and robustness by
focusing on the essentials. Supplementary to these techniques, we investigate
how to promote simple behavior throughout the episode. To that end, we
introduce a modification of the reinforcement learning problem that
additionally maximizes the total correlation within the induced trajectories.
We propose a practical algorithm that optimizes all models, including policy
and state representation, based on a lower-bound approximation. In simulated
robot environments, our method naturally generates policies that induce
periodic and compressible trajectories, and that exhibit superior robustness to
noise and changes in dynamics compared to baseline methods, while also
improving performance in the original tasks.

Motivation: 探讨GNN中过平滑现象的优化视角，特别是反向传播误差的过平滑问题。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究正向和反向过平滑的相互作用，并证明GNN中存在虚假平稳点。

Result: 发现反向过平滑导致GNN在训练过程中出现梯度接近零但损失仍高的区域。

Conclusion: 反向过平滑是GNN特有的现象，研究为理解GNN优化景观提供了新视角。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has long been identified as a major limitation of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs): input node features are smoothed at each layer and converge to
a non-informative representation, if the weights of the GNN are sufficiently
bounded. This assumption is crucial: if, on the contrary, the weights are
sufficiently large, then oversmoothing may not happen. Theoretically, GNN could
thus learn to not oversmooth. However it does not really happen in practice,
which prompts us to examine oversmoothing from an optimization point of view.
In this paper, we analyze backward oversmoothing, that is, the notion that
backpropagated errors used to compute gradients are also subject to
oversmoothing from output to input. With non-linear activation functions, we
outline the key role of the interaction between forward and backward smoothing.
Moreover, we show that, due to backward oversmoothing, GNNs provably exhibit
many spurious stationary points: as soon as the last layer is trained, the
whole GNN is at a stationary point. As a result, we can exhibit regions where
gradients are near-zero while the loss stays high. The proof relies on the fact
that, unlike forward oversmoothing, backward errors are subjected to a linear
oversmoothing even in the presence of non-linear activation function, such that
the average of the output error plays a key role. Additionally, we show that
this phenomenon is specific to deep GNNs, and exhibit counter-example
Multi-Layer Perceptron. This paper is a step toward a more complete
comprehension of the optimization landscape specific to GNNs.

Method: SAP框架在梯度传播过程中引入安全感知探测，识别潜在风险梯度方向，从而在提升任务性能的同时保持模型安全性。

Result: 实验表明，SAP能有效降低模型的有害性，且测试损失与标准微调方法相当。

Conclusion: SAP是一种有效的解决方案，可在微调过程中兼顾性能与安全性。

Abstract: The significant progress of large language models (LLMs) has led to
remarkable achievements across numerous applications. However, their ability to
generate harmful content has sparked substantial safety concerns. Despite the
implementation of safety alignment techniques during the pre-training phase,
recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs on adversarial or even benign
data can inadvertently compromise their safety. In this paper, we re-examine
the fundamental issue of why fine-tuning on non-harmful data still results in
safety degradation. We introduce a safety-aware probing (SAP) optimization
framework designed to mitigate the safety risks of fine-tuning LLMs.
Specifically, SAP incorporates a safety-aware probe into the gradient
propagation process, mitigating the model's risk of safety degradation by
identifying potential pitfalls in gradient directions, thereby enhancing
task-specific performance while successfully preserving model safety. Our
extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAP effectively reduces
harmfulness below the original fine-tuned model and achieves comparable test
loss to standard fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 最小注意力原则在RL中表现出卓越性能，尤其在快速适应和稳定性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Minimum attention applies the least action principle in the changes of
control concerning state and time, first proposed by Brockett. The involved
regularization is highly relevant in emulating biological control, such as
motor learning. We apply minimum attention in reinforcement learning (RL) as
part of the rewards and investigate its connection to meta-learning and
stabilization. Specifically, model-based meta-learning with minimum attention
is explored in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics. Ensemble-based model
learning and gradient-based meta-policy learning are alternately performed.
Empirically, we show that the minimum attention does show outperforming
competence in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in model-free and
model-based RL, i.e., fast adaptation in few shots and variance reduction from
the perturbations of the model and environment. Furthermore, the minimum
attention demonstrates the improvement in energy efficiency.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction as a powerful
paradigm for learning control policies from pre-collected data, eliminating the
need for costly or risky online interactions. While many open-source libraries
offer robust implementations of offline RL algorithms, they all rely on
datasets composed of experience tuples consisting of state, action, next state,
and reward. Managing, curating, and distributing such datasets requires
suitable infrastructure. Although static datasets exist for established
benchmark problems, no standardized or scalable solution supports developing
and sharing datasets for novel or user-defined benchmarks. To address this gap,
we introduce PyTupli, a Python-based tool to streamline the creation, storage,
and dissemination of benchmark environments and their corresponding tuple
datasets. PyTupli includes a lightweight client library with defined interfaces
for uploading and retrieving benchmarks and data. It supports fine-grained
filtering at both the episode and tuple level, allowing researchers to curate
high-quality, task-specific datasets. A containerized server component enables
production-ready deployment with authentication, access control, and automated
certificate provisioning for secure use. By addressing key barriers in dataset
infrastructure, PyTupli facilitates more collaborative, reproducible, and

Abstract: Graph-structured data is a type of data to be obtained associated with a
graph structure where vertices and edges describe some kind of data
correlation. This paper proposes a regression method on graph-structured data,
which is based on multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP), to capture both the
correlation between vertices and the correlation between associated data. The
proposed formulation is built on the definition of MOGP. This allows it to be
applied to a wide range of data configurations and scenarios. Moreover, it has
high expressive capability due to its flexibility in kernel design. It includes
existing methods of Gaussian processes for graph-structured data as special
cases and is possible to remove restrictions on data configurations, model
selection, and inference scenarios in the existing methods. The performance of
extensions achievable by the proposed formulation is evaluated through computer
experiments with synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: 架构约束可以同时增强预测性能和数学可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce FlowMixer, a neural architecture that leverages constrained
matrix operations to model structured spatiotemporal patterns. At its core,
FlowMixer incorporates non-negative matrix mixing layers within a reversible
mapping framework-applying transforms before mixing and their inverses
afterward. This shape-preserving design enables a Kronecker-Koopman eigenmode
framework that bridges statistical learning with dynamical systems theory,
providing interpretable spatiotemporal patterns and facilitating direct
algebraic manipulation of prediction horizons without retraining. Extensive
experiments across diverse domains demonstrate FlowMixer's robust long-horizon
forecasting capabilities while effectively modeling physical phenomena such as
chaotic attractors and turbulent flows. These results suggest that
architectural constraints can simultaneously enhance predictive performance and
mathematical interpretability in neural forecasting systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了掩码扩散模型（MDMs）在分子生成中的潜力，发现直接应用标准MDMs会严重降低性能，并提出了一种新的方法MELD来解决状态冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究掩码扩散模型在分子生成中的应用潜力，发现标准方法存在状态冲突问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出了Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD)，通过参数化的噪声调度网络为分子图的每个元素分配不同的破坏率，避免状态冲突。

Result: 实验表明，MELD显著提高了生成质量，化学有效性从15%提升到93%，并在条件生成任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MELD有效解决了状态冲突问题，显著提升了分子生成的质量和性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling
discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains
underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the
surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the
performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing
problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a
common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be
learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To
mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that
orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between
distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise
scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph
elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular
benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality
compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity
of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves
state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于群体的主动模态获取方法（CAMA），用于在资源有限时选择哪些样本应获取额外模态数据。通过生成式填补和判别式建模，结合评估指标，优化模态获取策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的多模态机器学习常面临部分模态数据缺失的问题，而获取额外模态成本高昂。如何在资源有限时高效选择样本获取额外模态是关键挑战。

Method: 提出CAMA框架，结合生成式填补和判别式建模，估计获取缺失模态的预期收益，并引入性能上限启发式方法作为基准。

Result: 实验表明，基于填补的策略比仅依赖单模态信息、熵引导或随机选择的方法更有效。

Conclusion: CAMA为群体层面的模态获取优化提供了有效解决方案，提升了资源受限场景下的资源利用率。

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple
modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions.
However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every
sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the
question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality
acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored
individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning
paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored despite
their importance in many real-world settings. We introduce Cohort-based Active
Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the
challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We
derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative
imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of
acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also
introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark
acquisition strategies. Experiments on common multimodal datasets demonstrate
that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the
acquisition of new samples in comparison to those relying solely on unimodal
information, entropy guidance, and random selections. Our work provides an
effective solution for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level,
enabling better utilization of resources in constrained settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合深度强化学习（DRL）游戏测试代理的自动化评估方法，用于评估程序化内容生成（PCG）在严肃游戏（SGs）中的集成效果。通过测试不同PCG版本（随机与遗传算法），结果显示DRL代理在遗传算法版本中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决评估PCG技术在SGs中集成效果的挑战，以提供更个性化的玩家体验。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）游戏测试代理，测试三种PCG版本（随机与遗传算法）对游戏环境的影响。

Result: 遗传算法版本（2和3）的DRL代理在胜率和训练时间上优于随机版本（1），胜率峰值达97%，显著高于随机版本的94%。

Conclusion: 研究证明了所提框架能有效评估PCG在SGs中的集成效果，为未来研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Serious Games (SGs) are nowadays shifting focus to include procedural content
generation (PCG) in the development process as a means of offering personalized
and enhanced player experience. However, the development of a framework to
assess the impact of PCG techniques when integrated into SGs remains
particularly challenging. This study proposes a methodology for automated
evaluation of PCG integration in SGs, incorporating deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) game testing agents. To validate the proposed framework, a previously
introduced SG featuring card game mechanics and incorporating three different
versions of PCG for nonplayer character (NPC) creation has been deployed.
Version 1 features random NPC creation, while versions 2 and 3 utilize a
genetic algorithm approach. These versions are used to test the impact of
different dynamic SG environments on the proposed framework's agents. The
obtained results highlight the superiority of the DRL game testing agents
trained on Versions 2 and 3 over those trained on Version 1 in terms of win
rate (i.e. number of wins per played games) and training time. More
specifically, within the execution of a test emulating regular gameplay, both
Versions 2 and 3 peaked at a 97% win rate and achieved statistically
significant higher (p=0009) win rates compared to those achieved in Version 1
that peaked at 94%. Overall, results advocate towards the proposed framework's
capability to produce meaningful data for the evaluation of procedurally
generated content in SGs.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习上下文价值分布，并为随机优化问题提供理论保证。

Abstract: Motivated by stochastic optimization, we introduce the problem of learning
from samples of contextual value distributions. A contextual value distribution
can be understood as a family of real-valued distributions, where each sample
consists of a context $x$ and a random variable drawn from the corresponding
real-valued distribution $D_x$. By minimizing a convex surrogate loss, we learn
an empirical distribution $D'_x$ for each context, ensuring a small L\'evy
distance to $D_x$. We apply this result to obtain the sample complexity bounds
for the learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for stochastic optimization
problems defined on an unknown contextual value distribution. The sample
complexity is shown to be polynomial for the general case of strongly monotone
and stable optimization problems, including Single-item Revenue Maximization,
Pandora's Box and Optimal Stopping.

Result: 通过三个实际应用验证了战略链接分数的实用性：解释RL代理、改进决策支持系统、分析非RL代理的规划过程。

Conclusion: 战略链接分数为理解和量化规划中的行动依赖关系提供了有效工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Long-term planning, as in reinforcement learning (RL), involves finding
strategies: actions that collectively work toward a goal rather than
individually optimizing their immediate outcomes. As part of a strategy, some
actions are taken at the expense of short-term benefit to enable future actions
with even greater returns. These actions are only advantageous if followed up
by the actions they facilitate, consequently, they would not have been taken if
those follow-ups were not available. In this paper, we quantify such
dependencies between planned actions with strategic link scores: the drop in
the likelihood of one decision under the constraint that a follow-up decision
is no longer available. We demonstrate the utility of strategic link scores
through three practical applications: (i) explaining black-box RL agents by
identifying strategically linked pairs among decisions they make, (ii)
improving the worst-case performance of decision support systems by
distinguishing whether recommended actions can be adopted as standalone
improvements or whether they are strategically linked hence requiring a
commitment to a broader strategy to be effective, and (iii) characterizing the
planning processes of non-RL agents purely through interventions aimed at
measuring strategic link scores - as an example, we consider a realistic
traffic simulator and analyze through road closures the effective planning
horizon of the emergent routing behavior of many drivers.

Result: 在适应性和信任方面进行了广泛基准测试，推理方面提供了文献驱动的见解。

Conclusion: ATR-Bench为联邦学习的系统化评估奠定了基础，并计划公开代码和持续更新的资源库。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data privacy across decentralized participants.
As FL adoption grows, numerous techniques have been proposed to tackle its
practical challenges. However, the lack of standardized evaluation across key
dimensions hampers systematic progress and fair comparison of FL methods. In
this work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated
learning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and
Reasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations,
task formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We
have extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation
to heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable
environments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in
FL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench
lays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated
learning with real-world relevance. We will make our complete codebase publicly
accessible and a curated repository that continuously tracks new developments
and research in the FL literature.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅使用离线预训练策略进行在线强化学习微调的方法PORL，解决了现有方法依赖预训练Q函数的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线RL微调方法依赖离线预训练的Q函数，但其保守性限制了探索能力，且无法适用于仅有预训练策略的场景（如模仿学习）。

Method: 提出PORL方法，在线阶段从零快速初始化Q函数，避免保守性，仅依赖离线预训练策略。

Result: PORL在性能上与先进的离线到在线RL算法及在线RL方法相当，并首次实现了直接微调行为克隆策略。

Conclusion: PORL为仅依赖预训练策略的在线RL微调提供了新途径，具有广泛适用性和竞争力。

Abstract: Improving the performance of pre-trained policies through online
reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical yet challenging topic. Existing
online RL fine-tuning methods require continued training with offline
pretrained Q-functions for stability and performance. However, these offline
pretrained Q-functions commonly underestimate state-action pairs beyond the
offline dataset due to the conservatism in most offline RL methods, which
hinders further exploration when transitioning from the offline to the online
setting. Additionally, this requirement limits their applicability in scenarios
where only pre-trained policies are available but pre-trained Q-functions are
absent, such as in imitation learning (IL) pre-training. To address these
challenges, we propose a method for efficient online RL fine-tuning using
solely the offline pre-trained policy, eliminating reliance on pre-trained
Q-functions. We introduce PORL (Policy-Only Reinforcement Learning
Fine-Tuning), which rapidly initializes the Q-function from scratch during the
online phase to avoid detrimental pessimism. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance with advanced offline-to-online RL algorithms and
online RL approaches that leverage data or policies prior, but also pioneers a
new path for directly fine-tuning behavior cloning (BC) policies.

Result: 实验表明，IC-SYSID在真实车辆动力学辨识问题中表现优异，避免了不稳定聚类的学习。

Conclusion: IC-SYSID是一种高效且稳定的联邦学习方法，适用于多数据源系统辨识问题。

Abstract: This paper addresses the System Identification (SYSID) problem within the
framework of federated learning. We introduce a novel algorithm, Incremental
Clustering-based federated learning method for SYSID (IC-SYSID), designed to
tackle SYSID challenges across multiple data sources without prior knowledge.
IC-SYSID utilizes an incremental clustering method, ClusterCraft (CC), to
eliminate the dependency on the prior knowledge of the dataset. CC starts with
a single cluster model and assigns similar local workers to the same clusters
by dynamically increasing the number of clusters. To reduce the number of
clusters generated by CC, we introduce ClusterMerge, where similar cluster
models are merged. We also introduce enhanced ClusterCraft to reduce the
generation of similar cluster models during the training. Moreover, IC-SYSID
addresses cluster model instability by integrating a regularization term into
the loss function and initializing cluster models with scaled Glorot
initialization. It also utilizes a mini-batch deep learning approach to manage
large SYSID datasets during local training. Through the experiments conducted
on a real-world representing SYSID problem, where a fleet of vehicles
collaboratively learns vehicle dynamics, we show that IC-SYSID achieves a high
SYSID performance while preventing the learning of unstable clusters.

Motivation: 传统图域适应方法局限于单步适应，无法处理连续域偏移且易发生灾难性遗忘。

Method: GCAL采用双层优化策略，包括基于信息最大化的适应阶段和基于信息瓶颈理论的记忆生成阶段。

Result: 实验表明，GCAL在适应性和知识保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GCAL为图数据的持续域适应提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of graph domain adaptation on evolving,
multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) graphs. Conventional graph domain adaptation
methods are confined to single-step adaptation, making them ineffective in
handling continuous domain shifts and prone to catastrophic forgetting. This
paper introduces the Graph Continual Adaptive Learning (GCAL) method, designed
to enhance model sustainability and adaptability across various graph domains.
GCAL employs a bilevel optimization strategy. The "adapt" phase uses an
information maximization approach to fine-tune the model with new graph domains
while re-adapting past memories to mitigate forgetting. Concurrently, the
"generate memory" phase, guided by a theoretical lower bound derived from
information bottleneck theory, involves a variational memory graph generation
module to condense original graphs into memories. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that GCAL substantially outperforms existing methods in
terms of adaptability and knowledge retention.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced
critical security challenges, underscoring the need for accurate anomaly
detection. Although numerous studies have proposed machine learning (ML)
methods for this purpose, limited research systematically examines how
different preprocessing steps--normalization, transformation, and feature
selection--interact with distinct model architectures. To address this gap,
this paper presents a multi-step evaluation framework assessing the combined
impact of preprocessing choices on three ML algorithms: RNN-LSTM, autoencoder
neural networks (ANN), and Gradient Boosting (GBoosting). Experiments on the
IoTID20 dataset shows that GBoosting consistently delivers superior accuracy
across preprocessing configurations, while RNN-LSTM shows notable gains with
z-score normalization and autoencoders excel in recall, making them well-suited
for unsupervised scenarios. By offering a structured analysis of preprocessing
decisions and their interplay with various ML techniques, the proposed
framework provides actionable guidance to enhance anomaly detection performance
in IoT environments.

Result: 该方法显著提升了模型性能，例如在ESM2接触预测任务中提升了12.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的双任务框架有效整合了蛋白质结构知识，为生物应用提供了更强大的模型。

Abstract: Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases
excel at various downstream tasks but lack the structural knowledge essential
for many biological applications. To address this, we integrate structural
insights from pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs) into pLMs
through a latent-level contrastive learning task. This task aligns residue
representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins,
enriching pLMs with inter-protein structural knowledge. Additionally, we
incorporate a physical-level task that infuses intra-protein structural
knowledge by optimizing pLMs to predict structural tokens. The proposed
dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter-protein and
intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the
quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss
selection module, which uses a small model trained on high-quality structures
to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn.
Applying our structure alignment method to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and
AMPLIFY results in notable performance gains across a wide range of tasks,
including a 12.7% increase in ESM2 contact prediction. The data, code, and
resulting SaESM2 and SaAMPLIFY models will be released on Hugging Face.

Conclusion: 本文提出的无监督GNN提示方法在挑战性设置下表现优异，为GNN提示领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt tuning methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular to
address the semantic gap between pre-training and fine-tuning steps. However,
existing GNN prompting methods rely on labeled data and involve lightweight
fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning methods for
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance with no parameter
updating and no or minimal labeled data. Inspired by these approaches, in this
work, we first introduce a challenging problem setup to evaluate GNN prompting
methods. This setup encourages a prompting function to enhance a pre-trained
GNN's generalization to a target dataset under covariate shift without updating
the GNN's parameters and with no labeled data. Next, we propose a fully
unsupervised prompting method based on consistency regularization through
pseudo-labeling. We use two regularization techniques to align the prompted
graphs' distribution with the original data and reduce biased predictions.
Through extensive experiments under our problem setting, we demonstrate that
our unsupervised approach outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting methods
that have access to labels.

Abstract: This paper presents a concise review of Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB)

models context at the product category level, allowing offers to span multiple

extends standard CMAB methodology to support multi-category contexts, and
achieves scalability through efficient feature engineering and modular design.
Advanced features such as MPG (Member Purchase Gap) and MF (Matrix

  A key contribution is interpretability at scale: logistic regression models
yield transparent weight vectors, accessible via a large language model (LLM)

identification of behavioral patterns, supporting personalized offer
optimization and enhancing trust in automated decisions. By situating our

Thompson Sampling, we demonstrate its value for both research and real-world
CMAB applications.

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数解决了数值不稳定问题，并在实际应用中表现出色，为风险厌恶强化学习提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Risk-averse reinforcement learning finds application in various high-stakes
fields. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize
expected returns, risk-averse agents choose policies that minimize risk,
occasionally sacrificing expected value. These preferences can be framed
through utility theory. We focus on the specific case of the exponential
utility function, where we can derive the Bellman equations and employ various
reinforcement learning algorithms with few modifications. However, these
methods suffer from numerical instability due to the need for exponent
computation throughout the process. To address this, we introduce a numerically
stable and mathematically sound loss function based on the Itakura-Saito
divergence for learning state-value and action-value functions. We evaluate our
proposed loss function against established alternatives, both theoretically and
empirically. In the experimental section, we explore multiple financial
scenarios, some with known analytical solutions, and show that our loss
function outperforms the alternatives.

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has
been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently,
it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within
the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting
differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep
learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high
accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like
Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based
on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are
poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a
GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical
polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix
multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen &
Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule
at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that
it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both
rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address
finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply
Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent
improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2,
outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

TL;DR: LLaDA-V是一种基于扩散的多模态大语言模型，通过视觉指令调优和掩码扩散模型实现多模态对齐，性能优于现有混合自回归-扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索扩散模型在多模态任务中的潜力，突破当前以自回归为主的多模态方法。

Method: 基于LLaDA语言扩散模型，引入视觉编码器和MLP连接器，将视觉特征投影到语言嵌入空间。

Result: LLaDA-V在多模态任务中表现优异，性能接近Qwen2-VL，并在多模态理解上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在多模态任务中具有潜力，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked
diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms
dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative
large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP
connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space,
enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals
several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal
performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks
than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same
instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal
tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to
Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal
tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal
understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely
diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion
models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in
future research. Project page and codes:

<details>

Motivation: 物联网系统中多传感器观测需要从分布式视角中提取空间现象，但现有方法常忽略数据的空间特性，因此需要一种能编码信号与观测位置关系的方法。

Result: 在车辆监控、人类活动识别和地震定位三个真实数据集上验证了方法的通用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了自监督预训练在物联网信号中的应用效果，适用于多种模态、传感器布局和空间尺度。

Abstract: This work develops the underpinnings of self-supervised placement-aware
representation learning given spatially-distributed (multi-view and multimodal)
sensor observations, motivated by the need to represent external environmental
state in multi-sensor IoT systems in a manner that correctly distills spatial
phenomena from the distributed multi-vantage observations. The objective of
sensing in IoT systems is, in general, to collectively represent an externally
observed environment given multiple vantage points from which sensory
observations occur. Pretraining of models that help interpret sensor data must
therefore encode the relation between signals observed by sensors and the
observers' vantage points in order to attain a representation that encodes the
observed spatial phenomena in a manner informed by the specific placement of
the measuring instruments, while allowing arbitrary placement. The work
significantly advances self-supervised model pretraining from IoT signals
beyond current solutions that often overlook the distinctive spatial nature of
IoT data. Our framework explicitly learns the dependencies between measurements
and geometric observer layouts and structural characteristics, guided by a core
design principle: the duality between signals and observer positions. We
further provide theoretical analyses from the perspectives of information
theory and occlusion-invariant representation learning to offer insight into
the rationale behind our design. Experiments on three real-world
datasets--covering vehicle monitoring, human activity recognition, and
earthquake localization--demonstrate the superior generalizability and
robustness of our method across diverse modalities, sensor placements,
application-level inference tasks, and spatial scales.

Result: 研究展示了基础模型在多种临床任务中的表现，并分析了预训练、标记化和数据表示策略的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为结构化EHR基础模型的评估和未来开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their
capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks.
This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical
applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in
settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare.
However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical
utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and
sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional
supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically
meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and
chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate
state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients
from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic
medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We
measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface
tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data
representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation
of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future
healthcare foundation models.

TL;DR: MixAT是一种结合离散和连续对抗攻击的新方法，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的鲁棒性，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对抗训练在传统机器学习中有效，但在LLM中的应用尚不明确，且现有方法存在计算成本高或鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: MixAT结合了强离散攻击和快速连续攻击进行训练，并提出了ALO-ASR指标评估模型的最坏情况漏洞。

Result: MixAT在鲁棒性（ALO-ASR < 20%）和计算效率上优于现有防御方法（ALO-ASR > 50%）。

Conclusion: MixAT为构建更安全的LLM提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，揭示了当前方法的盲点。

Abstract: Despite recent efforts in Large Language Models (LLMs) safety and alignment,
current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs are still able to force harmful
generations consistently. Although adversarial training has been widely studied
and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine
learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less
understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are
effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial
prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous
relaxations. As these relaxations do not correspond to discrete input tokens,
such latent training methods often leave models vulnerable to a diverse set of
discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT,
a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks
during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of
state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate
(ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show
MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to
prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to
methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic
deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank
adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation,
revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results
demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and
superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead,
highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and
models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练分布外的泛化能力有限，表现为模式插值而非抽象推理。研究旨在通过信息瓶颈理论解决这一问题。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈理论证明Transformer的局限性，提出一种模块周期性重写KV缓存，优化序列表示。

Result: 改进模型在数学推理任务上表现优异，优于参数更多的普通Transformer及启发式缓存压缩方法。

Conclusion: 通过信息理论框架优化Transformer内存，解决了单纯扩展无法克服的推理限制。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with
generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting
sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning
(extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of
Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation
emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of
predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that
decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form
task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate
that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level
representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving
Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical
insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the
form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic
intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward
encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers
substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both
vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as
heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be
seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;
whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they
often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their
capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This
establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using
information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling
alone cannot overcome.

challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO
research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training

Result: 在合成、半合成和真实医疗数据集上验证了所提调整方法的重要性。

Conclusion: ICYM2I框架能有效解决多模态学习中的模态缺失问题，提高信息增益估计的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning is of continued interest in artificial intelligence-based
applications, motivated by the potential information gain from combining
different types of data. However, modalities collected and curated during
development may differ from the modalities available at deployment due to
multiple factors including cost, hardware failure, or -- as we argue in this
work -- the perceived informativeness of a given modality. Na{\"i}ve estimation
of the information gain associated with including an additional modality
without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that
modality's value in downstream tasks. Our work formalizes the problem of
missingness in multimodal learning and demonstrates the biases resulting from
ignoring this process. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You
Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance
and information gain under missingness through inverse probability
weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed
adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world medical datasets.

TL;DR: 扩散概率模型在生成AI中至关重要，但其泛化机制尚不清楚。研究发现，在高度过参数化的扩散模型中，泛化在训练过程中逐步实现，早于记忆化。记忆化时间与数据集大小成正比，泛化与记忆化是时间尺度的竞争。

Result: 发现记忆化时间与数据集大小成正比，泛化在训练早期实现。

Conclusion: 提出基于数据集大小的早期停止准则，优化泛化并避免记忆化。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have become a cornerstone of modern generative
AI, yet the mechanisms underlying their generalization remain poorly
understood. In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training
loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e.,
memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this
view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models,
generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during
training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to
language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that
memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs.
memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We
show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple
probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization
corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training
time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized.
We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support
that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can
effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct
implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.

Result: UFT在各类模型规模上均优于SFT和RFT，并理论上突破了RFT的指数样本复杂度瓶颈。

Conclusion: UFT是一种高效的后训练范式，显著提升了模型的推理能力，且收敛速度更快。

Abstract: Post-training has demonstrated its importance in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary post-training methods
can be categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT is efficient and well-suited for small language models,
but it may lead to overfitting and limit the reasoning abilities of larger
models. In contrast, RFT generally yields better generalization but depends
heavily on the strength of the base model. To address the limitations of SFT
and RFT, we propose Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), a novel post-training paradigm
that unifies SFT and RFT into a single, integrated process. UFT enables the
model to effectively explore solutions while incorporating informative
supervision signals, bridging the gap between memorizing and thinking
underlying existing methods. Notably, UFT outperforms both SFT and RFT in
general, regardless of model sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that
UFT breaks RFT's inherent exponential sample complexity bottleneck, showing for
the first time that unified training can exponentially accelerate convergence
on long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the
most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity
of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have
emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics
simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a
differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with
Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both
the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established
benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show
that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated
turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised
training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular,
we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow
purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with
our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while
keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights
into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a
physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential
of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source:

Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse
problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or
noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model
and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an
unconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator
architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse
observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous
mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling
approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in
function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five
PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy
improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while
reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning
ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of
discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and
inverse problems in the context of PDEs. Code is available at

Conclusion: 贝叶斯理论为提示优化提供了概念框架，同时揭示了提示的局限性，强调了权重调整的重要性。

Abstract: Prompting is one of the main ways to adapt a pretrained model to target
tasks. Besides manually constructing prompts, many prompt optimization methods
have been proposed in the literature. Method development is mainly empirically
driven, with less emphasis on a conceptual understanding of prompting. In this
paper we discuss how optimal prompting can be understood through a Bayesian
view, which also implies some fundamental limitations of prompting that can
only be overcome by tuning weights. The paper explains in detail how
meta-trained neural networks behave as Bayesian predictors over the pretraining
distribution, whose hallmark feature is rapid in-context adaptation. Optimal
prompting can be studied formally as conditioning these Bayesian predictors,
yielding criteria for target tasks where optimal prompting is and is not
possible. We support the theory with educational experiments on LSTMs and
Transformers, where we compare different versions of prefix-tuning and
different weight-tuning methods. We also confirm that soft prefixes, which are
sequences of real-valued vectors outside the token alphabet, can lead to very
effective prompts for trained and even untrained networks by manipulating
activations in ways that are not achievable by hard tokens. This adds an
important mechanistic aspect beyond the conceptual Bayesian theory.

Abstract: Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating
specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches
emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly
these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual
models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the
likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the
model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept
has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent
evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel
probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in
place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between
minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts.
Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for
erasure in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce RIPT-VLA, a simple and scalable reinforcement-learning-based
interactive post-training paradigm that fine-tunes pretrained
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using only sparse binary success rewards.
Existing VLA training pipelines rely heavily on offline expert demonstration
data and supervised imitation, limiting their ability to adapt to new tasks and
environments under low-data regimes. RIPT-VLA addresses this by enabling
interactive post-training with a stable policy optimization algorithm based on
dynamic rollout sampling and leave-one-out advantage estimation.
  RIPT-VLA has the following characteristics. First, it applies to various VLA
models, resulting in an improvement on the lightweight QueST model by 21.2%,
and the 7B OpenVLA-OFT model to an unprecedented 97.5% success rate. Second, it
is computationally efficient and data-efficient: with only one demonstration,
RIPT-VLA enables an unworkable SFT model (4%) to succeed with a 97% success
rate within 15 iterations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policy learned
by RIPT-VLA generalizes across different tasks and scenarios and is robust to
the initial state context. These results highlight RIPT-VLA as a practical and
effective paradigm for post-training VLA models through minimal supervision.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为通用数据格式（CDF）的标准化足球数据格式，旨在解决多源数据不一致的问题，便于分析和决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足球比赛中，不同数据提供商收集的数据存在差异（如数据内容、规格、表示方式和交付方式），导致分析成本高昂。因此，需要一种统一的数据格式来简化数据处理。

Method: 提出了CDF，规定了五种比赛数据的最小模式：比赛名单数据、视频片段、事件数据、跟踪数据和比赛元数据，并详细说明了技术规格和表示选择。

Result: CDF确保了数据的清晰性、上下文完整性和可分析性，为下游分析任务提供了便利。

Conclusion: CDF为足球数据提供了一种标准化解决方案，降低了数据处理的复杂性和成本。

Abstract: During football matches, a variety of different parties (e.g., companies)
each collect (possibly overlapping) data about the match ranging from basic
information (e.g., starting players) to detailed positional data. This data is
provided to clubs, federations, and other organizations who are increasingly
interested in leveraging this data to inform their decision making.
Unfortunately, analyzing such data pose significant barriers because each
provider may (1) collect different data, (2) use different specifications even
within the same category of data, (3) represent the data differently, and (4)
delivers the data in a different manner (e.g., file format, protocol).
Consequently, working with these data requires a significant investment of time
and money. The goal of this work is to propose a uniform and standardized
format for football data called the Common Data Format (CDF). The CDF specifies
a minimal schema for five types of match data: match sheet data, video footage,
event data, tracking data, and match meta data. It aims to ensure that the
provided data is clear, sufficiently contextualized (e.g., its provenance is
clear), and complete such that it enables common downstream analysis tasks.
Concretely, this paper will detail the technical specifications of the CDF, the
representational choices that were made to help ensure the clarity of the
provided data, and a concrete approach for delivering data in the CDF.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WikiDBGraph，一个大规模的真实世界表格数据库图，用于解决现有协作学习方法因数据稀缺而受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单一表格或孤立数据库，限制了模型能力，而协作学习方法因缺乏真实互联表格资源而面临挑战。

Method: 构建了包含10万个真实表格数据库的WikiDBGraph，通过1700万条边连接，并提取了13种节点和12种边属性。

Result: 实验表明，协作学习在新识别的数据库上表现更优，为结构化基础模型训练提供了潜力。

Conclusion: WikiDBGraph为互联表格数据学习提供了新资源，同时揭示了未来研究方向的关键挑战。

Abstract: Tabular data, ubiquitous and rich in informational value, is an increasing
focus for deep representation learning, yet progress is hindered by studies
centered on single tables or isolated databases, which limits model
capabilities due to data scale. While collaborative learning approaches such as
federated learning, transfer learning, split learning, and tabular foundation
models aim to learn from multiple correlated databases, they are challenged by
a scarcity of real-world interconnected tabular resources. Current data lakes
and corpora largely consist of isolated databases lacking defined
inter-database correlations. To overcome this, we introduce WikiDBGraph, a
large-scale graph of 100,000 real-world tabular databases from WikiData,
interconnected by 17 million edges and characterized by 13 node and 12 edge
properties derived from its database schema and data distribution.
WikiDBGraph's weighted edges identify both instance- and feature-overlapped
databases. Experiments on these newly identified databases confirm that
collaborative learning yields superior performance, thereby offering
considerable promise for structured foundation model training while also
exposing key challenges and future directions for learning from interconnected
tabular data.

TL;DR: 研究通过城市交通系统数据揭示了社会隔离的动态性及其与城市政策的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离不仅是居住地的结果，还涉及日常流动性，但缺乏与城市政策的具体证据联系。

Method: 使用城市级GPS移动数据和概率性移动框架，分析交通基础设施对社会互动的影响。

Result: 社会隔离随时间、城市设计和交通服务变化，交通政策可能对隔离产生意外影响。

Conclusion: 城市政策需考虑干预对居民日常生活的广泛影响，以实现积极社会变革。

Abstract: Mobility is a fundamental feature of human life, and through it our
interactions with the world and people around us generate complex and
consequential social phenomena. Social segregation, one such process, is
increasingly acknowledged as a product of one's entire lived experience rather
than mere residential location. Increasingly granular sources of data on human
mobility have evidenced how segregation persists outside the home, in
workplaces, cafes, and on the street. Yet there remains only a weak evidential
link between the production of social segregation and urban policy. This study
addresses this gap through an assessment of the role of the urban
transportation systems in shaping social segregation. Using city-scale GPS
mobility data and a novel probabilistic mobility framework, we establish social
interactions at the scale of transportation infrastructure, by rail and bus
service segment, individual roads, and city blocks. The outcomes show how
social segregation is more than a single process in space, but varying by time
of day, urban design and structure, and service design. These findings
reconceptualize segregation as a product of likely encounters during one's
daily mobility practice. We then extend these findings through exploratory
simulations, highlighting how transportation policy to promote sustainable
transport may have potentially unforeseen impacts on segregation. The study
underscores that to understand social segregation and achieve positive social
change urban policymakers must consider the broadest impacts of their
interventions and seek to understand their impact on the daily lived experience
of their citizens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学数据中的因果发现对理解基因调控机制至关重要，但面临高维度、间接关系区分和隐藏混杂因素的挑战。

Method: GENESIS通过初始化为空祖先矩阵，逐步填充直接、间接或非因果关系，结合基因型作为固定因果锚点，限制搜索空间。

Result: 在合成和真实基因组数据集上测试，GENESIS能够有效揭示复杂性状中的因果路径。

Conclusion: GENESIS为功能基因组学、药物发现和精准医学提供了强大的因果发现工具。

Abstract: Causal discovery in multi-omic datasets is crucial for understanding the
bigger picture of gene regulatory mechanisms, but remains challenging due to
high dimensionality, differentiation of direct from indirect relationships, and
hidden confounders. We introduce GENESIS (GEne Network inference from
Expression SIgnals and SNPs), a constraint-based algorithm that leverages the
natural causal precedence of genotypes to infer ancestral relationships in
transcriptomic data. Unlike traditional causal discovery methods that start
with a fully connected graph, GENESIS initialises an empty ancestrality matrix
and iteratively populates it with direct, indirect or non-causal relationships
using a series of provably sound marginal and conditional independence tests.
By integrating genotypes as fixed causal anchors, GENESIS provides a principled
``head start'' to classical causal discovery algorithms, restricting the search
space to biologically plausible edges. We test GENESIS on synthetic and
real-world genomic datasets. This framework offers a powerful avenue for
uncovering causal pathways in complex traits, with promising applications to
functional genomics, drug discovery, and precision medicine.

*Awni Altabaa,Omar Montasser,John Lafferty*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统计理论，用于分析在链式思维（CoT）监督下的学习问题，证明了CoT监督可以显著提高学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习在处理多步推理任务时面临挑战，CoT监督通过提供中间推理步骤显示出强大的潜力，但缺乏理论支持。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过引入CoT信息度量，将训练目标（CoT风险）与测试目标（端到端风险）联系起来，推导出更紧的样本复杂度界限。

Result: 理论结果表明，CoT监督的学习速率显著快于标准端到端监督，样本复杂度与CoT信息度量成反比。

Conclusion: CoT信息度量是学习链式思维监督任务的基本统计复杂度指标。

Abstract: Learning complex functions that involve multi-step reasoning poses a
significant challenge for standard supervised learning from input-output
examples. Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, which provides intermediate
reasoning steps together with the final output, has emerged as a powerful
empirical technique, underpinning much of the recent progress in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. This paper develops a statistical theory
of learning under CoT supervision. A key characteristic of the CoT setting, in
contrast to standard supervision, is the mismatch between the training
objective (CoT risk) and the test objective (end-to-end risk). A central part
of our analysis, distinguished from prior work, is explicitly linking those two
types of risk to achieve sharper sample complexity bounds. This is achieved via
the *CoT information measure* $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D},
h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, which quantifies the additional
discriminative power gained from observing the reasoning process. The main
theoretical results demonstrate how CoT supervision can yield significantly
faster learning rates compared to standard E2E supervision. Specifically, it is
shown that the sample complexity required to achieve a target E2E error
$\epsilon$ scales as $d/\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D},
h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, where $d$ is a measure of hypothesis
class complexity, which can be much faster than standard $d/\epsilon$ rates.
Information-theoretic lower bounds in terms of the CoT information are also
obtained. Together, these results suggest that CoT information is a fundamental
measure of statistical complexity for learning under chain-of-thought
supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供一种统一框架，支持个性化潜在结果预测、反事实预测和不确定性感知密度学习，无需显式分布假设。

Result: 在ACIC、IHDP和IBM等基准测试中表现优于现有方法，适用于高维场景。

Conclusion: PO-Flow在因果推断任务中具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: We propose PO-Flow, a novel continuous normalizing flow (CNF) framework for
causal inference that jointly models potential outcomes and counterfactuals.
Trained via flow matching, PO-Flow provides a unified framework for
individualized potential outcome prediction, counterfactual predictions, and
uncertainty-aware density learning. Among generative models, it is the first to
enable density learning of potential outcomes without requiring explicit
distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian mixtures), while also supporting
counterfactual prediction conditioned on factual outcomes in general
observational datasets. On benchmarks such as ACIC, IHDP, and IBM, it
consistently outperforms prior methods across a range of causal inference
tasks. Beyond that, PO-Flow succeeds in high-dimensional settings, including
counterfactual image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SnapMMD的新框架，用于从“快照”数据中预测超出观测时间范围的动态，解决了现有方法在预测中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学家需要从快照数据中预测超出观测时间范围的动态，但现有方法（如Schrödinger-bridge）在预测时表现不佳，因为它们依赖于预设的动态或固定的波动性。

Method: SnapMMD通过最大均值差异（MMD）损失直接拟合状态测量和观测时间的联合分布，从而学习动态，并推断未知和状态依赖的波动性。

Result: 实验表明，SnapMMD在真实和合成数据中均能提供准确的预测，且在插值和速度场重构方面的表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SnapMMD是一种有效的框架，能够从快照数据中学习动态并实现准确的预测和插值，同时支持不完全状态测量和诊断拟合质量。

Abstract: Scientists often want to make predictions beyond the observed time horizon of
"snapshot" data following latent stochastic dynamics. For example, in time
course single-cell mRNA profiling, scientists have access to cellular
transcriptional state measurements (snapshots) from different biological
replicates at different time points, but they cannot access the trajectory of
any one cell because measurement destroys the cell. Researchers want to
forecast (e.g.) differentiation outcomes from early state measurements of stem
cells. Recent Schr\"odinger-bridge (SB) methods are natural for interpolating
between snapshots. But past SB papers have not addressed forecasting -- likely
since existing methods either (1) reduce to following pre-set reference
dynamics (chosen before seeing data) or (2) require the user to choose a fixed,
state-independent volatility since they minimize a Kullback-Leibler divergence.
Either case can lead to poor forecasting quality. In the present work, we
propose a new framework, SnapMMD, that learns dynamics by directly fitting the
joint distribution of both state measurements and observation time with a
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss. Unlike past work, our method allows us to
infer unknown and state-dependent volatilities from the observed data. We show
in a variety of real and synthetic experiments that our method delivers
accurate forecasts. Moreover, our approach allows us to learn in the presence
of incomplete state measurements and yields an $R^2$-style statistic that
diagnoses fit. We also find that our method's performance at interpolation (and
general velocity-field reconstruction) is at least as good as (and often better
than) state-of-the-art in almost all of our experiments.

Result: DANA通过动态调整动量超参数，显著优于传统SGD-M，并在高维合成数据和大规模文本实验中验证了其优势。

Conclusion: DANA在广泛的数据和目标复杂度范围内表现优异，为计算最优扩展行为提供了新方向。

Abstract: We investigate scaling laws for stochastic momentum algorithms with small
batch on the power law random features model, parameterized by data complexity,
target complexity, and model size. When trained with a stochastic momentum
algorithm, our analysis reveals four distinct loss curve shapes determined by
varying data-target complexities. While traditional stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGD-M) yields identical scaling law exponents to SGD,
dimension-adapted Nesterov acceleration (DANA) improves these exponents by
scaling momentum hyperparameters based on model size and data complexity. This
outscaling phenomenon, which also improves compute-optimal scaling behavior, is
achieved by DANA across a broad range of data and target complexities, while
traditional methods fall short. Extensive experiments on high-dimensional
synthetic quadratics validate our theoretical predictions and large-scale text
experiments with LSTMs show DANA's improved loss exponents over SGD hold in a
practical setting.

Motivation: BPCA在降维中广泛应用，但其CAVI算法的收敛速度尚未被研究。

Method: 通过连接经典幂迭代算法，证明单主成分模型的指数收敛；利用新工具推广到多主成分模型。

Result: 单主成分模型收敛结果与传统PCA一致；多主成分模型收敛性通过新下界证明。

Conclusion: 研究填补了BPCA收敛速度的理论空白，并提出了信息论中独立有用的新下界。

Abstract: Probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA) and its Bayesian variant
(BPCA) are widely used for dimension reduction in machine learning and
statistics. The main advantage of probabilistic PCA over the traditional
formulation is allowing uncertainty quantification. The parameters of BPCA are
typically learned using mean-field variational inference, and in particular,
the coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) algorithm. So far, the
convergence speed of CAVI for BPCA has not been characterized. In our paper, we
fill this gap in the literature. Firstly, we prove a precise exponential
convergence result in the case where the model uses a single principal
component (PC). Interestingly, this result is established through a connection
with the classical $\textit{power iteration algorithm}$ and it indicates that
traditional PCA is retrieved as points estimates of the BPCA parameters.
Secondly, we leverage recent tools to prove exponential convergence of CAVI for
the model with any number of PCs, thus leading to a more general result, but
one that is of a slightly different flavor. To prove the latter result, we
additionally needed to introduce a novel lower bound for the symmetric
Kullback--Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions,
which, we believe, is of independent interest in information theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典概率方法无法充分表示认知不确定性，而不精确概率理论提供了更丰富的模型。因此，需要一种新的度量框架来支持不精确概率机器学习（IPML）中的推理和决策。

Method: 引入积分不精确概率度量（IIPM）框架，基于Choquet积分，扩展了经典积分概率度量（IPM）以适用于容量（capacity）模型。

Result: IIPM不仅支持不同不精确概率模型的比较，还能量化单一模型内的认知不确定性。提出的最大平均不精确度（MMI）在实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: IIPM框架为IPML提供了理论和实践上的新工具，能够有效比较和量化不精确概率模型中的认知不确定性。

Abstract: Quantifying differences between probability distributions is fundamental to
statistics and machine learning, primarily for comparing statistical
uncertainty. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty (EU) -- due to incomplete
knowledge -- requires richer representations than those offered by classical
probability. Imprecise probability (IP) theory offers such models, capturing
ambiguity and partial belief. This has driven growing interest in imprecise
probabilistic machine learning (IPML), where inference and decision-making rely
on broader uncertainty models -- highlighting the need for metrics beyond
classical probability. This work introduces the Integral Imprecise Probability
Metric (IIPM) framework, a Choquet integral-based generalisation of classical
Integral Probability Metric (IPM) to the setting of capacities -- a broad class
of IP models encompassing many existing ones, including lower probabilities,
probability intervals, belief functions, and more. Theoretically, we establish
conditions under which IIPM serves as a valid metric and metrises a form of
weak convergence of capacities. Practically, IIPM not only enables comparison
across different IP models but also supports the quantification of epistemic
uncertainty within a single IP model. In particular, by comparing an IP model
with its conjugate, IIPM gives rise to a new class of EU measures -- Maximum
Mean Imprecision -- which satisfy key axiomatic properties proposed in the
Uncertainty Quantification literature. We validate MMI through selective
classification experiments, demonstrating strong empirical performance against
established EU measures, and outperforming them when classical methods struggle
to scale to a large number of classes. Our work advances both theory and
practice in IPML, offering a principled framework for comparing and quantifying
epistemic uncertainty under imprecision.

Motivation: 传统幂先验通过KL散度结合历史数据，但缺乏灵活性。研究旨在通过广义α-散度提升数据适应性和性能。

Method: 扩展幂先验框架，使用Amari的α-散度最小化线性组合，推导广义幂后验分布，并分析其几何性质。

Result: 广义幂后验在优化α参数时表现更优，且具有黎曼流形上的广义测地线性质。

Conclusion: 广义幂后验框架提供了更灵活的数据适应性，为贝叶斯分析中的历史数据整合提供了新视角。

Abstract: The power prior is a class of informative priors designed to incorporate
historical data alongside current data in a Bayesian framework. It includes a
power parameter that controls the influence of historical data, providing
flexibility and adaptability. A key property of the power prior is that the
resulting posterior minimizes a linear combination of KL divergences between
two pseudo-posterior distributions: one ignoring historical data and the other
fully incorporating it. We extend this framework by identifying the posterior
distribution as the minimizer of a linear combination of Amari's
$\alpha$-divergence, a generalization of KL divergence. We show that this
generalization can lead to improved performance by allowing for the data to
adapt to appropriate choices of the $\alpha$ parameter. Theoretical properties
of this generalized power posterior are established, including behavior as a
generalized geodesic on the Riemannian manifold of probability distributions,
offering novel insights into its geometric interpretation.

Motivation: 传统黑盒偏移估计器对噪声和类别相似性敏感，GS-B³SE旨在提供更稳健的解决方案。

Result: 证明了可识别性、收缩性、方差界限缩小以及鲁棒性，并展示了其作为现有偏移估计器的推广。

Conclusion: GS-B³SE是一种高效且稳健的标签偏移适应方法，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Label shift adaptation aims to recover target class priors when the labelled
source distribution $P$ and the unlabelled target distribution $Q$ share $P(X
\mid Y) = Q(X \mid Y)$ but $P(Y) \neq Q(Y)$. Classical black-box shift
estimators invert an empirical confusion matrix of a frozen classifier,
producing a brittle point estimate that ignores sampling noise and similarity
among classes. We present Graph-Smoothed Bayesian BBSE (GS-B$^3$SE), a fully
probabilistic alternative that places Laplacian-Gaussian priors on both target
log-priors and confusion-matrix columns, tying them together on a
label-similarity graph. The resulting posterior is tractable with HMC or a fast
block Newton-CG scheme. We prove identifiability, $N^{-1/2}$ contraction,
variance bounds that shrink with the graph's algebraic connectivity, and
robustness to Laplacian misspecification. We also reinterpret GS-B$^3$SE
through information geometry, showing that it generalizes existing shift
estimators.

Conclusion: 结论表明，高阶修正和稳健一步更新可以显著提升BN层在适应变化数据分布时的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: This study develops a higher-order asymptotic framework for test-time
adaptation (TTA) of Batch Normalization (BN) statistics under distribution
shift by integrating classical Edgeworth expansion and saddlepoint
approximation techniques with a novel one-step M-estimation perspective. By
analyzing the statistical discrepancy between training and test distributions,
we derive an Edgeworth expansion for the normalized difference in BN means and
obtain an optimal weighting parameter that minimizes the mean-squared error of
the adapted statistic. Reinterpreting BN TTA as a one-step M-estimator allows
us to derive higher-order local asymptotic normality results, which incorporate
skewness and other higher moments into the estimator's behavior. Moreover, we
quantify the trade-offs among bias, variance, and skewness in the adaptation
process and establish a corresponding generalization bound on the model risk.
The refined saddlepoint approximations further deliver uniformly accurate
density and tail probability estimates for the BN TTA statistic. These
theoretical insights provide a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order
corrections and robust one-step updating can enhance the reliability and
performance of BN layers in adapting to changing data distributions.

Result: 在模拟研究中，GAMBITTS优于传统算法，并通过分解治疗和奖励的不确定性来源，证明了其更强的理论保证。

Conclusion: GAMBITTS为生成式AI驱动的干预提供了更高效的Bandit方法，尤其在移动健康干预等应用中表现突出。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have
enabled the generation of personalized content that adapts to up-to-date user
context. While personalized decision systems are often modeled using bandit
formulations, the integration of GenAI introduces new structure into otherwise
classical sequential learning problems. In GenAI-powered interventions, the
agent selects a query, but the environment experiences a stochastic response
drawn from the generative model. Standard bandit methods do not explicitly
account for this structure, where actions influence rewards only through
stochastic, observed treatments. We introduce generator-mediated
bandit-Thompson sampling (GAMBITTS), a bandit approach designed for this
action/treatment split, using mobile health interventions with large language
model-generated text as a motivating case study. GAMBITTS explicitly models
both the treatment and reward generation processes, using information in the
delivered treatment to accelerate policy learning relative to standard methods.
We establish regret bounds for GAMBITTS by decomposing sources of uncertainty
in treatment and reward, identifying conditions where it achieves stronger
guarantees than standard bandit approaches. In simulation studies, GAMBITTS
consistently outperforms conventional algorithms by leveraging observed

### [366] [Better Rates for Private Linear Regression in the Proportional Regime via Aggressive Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16329)
*Simone Bombari,Inbar Seroussi,Marco Mondelli*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文研究了差分隐私（DP）线性回归中DP-SGD的优化性能，通过频繁剪裁和ODE分析，证明了激进剪裁的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理论分析中通常将剪裁常数设得远大于梯度范数，而实际优化性能与此不符。本文旨在弥合理论与实践的差距。

Method: 在多元高斯数据下，通过建立DP-SGD轨迹的确定性ODE等效模型，分析风险边界。

Result: 证明了激进剪裁的优越性，并揭示了学习率衰减和隐私噪声调度的优势。

Conclusion: 通过ODE分析，本文为DP-SGD的优化提供了理论支持，并验证了实践中的高效策略。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) linear regression has received significant
attention in the recent theoretical literature, with several works aimed at
obtaining improved error rates. A common approach is to set the clipping
constant much larger than the expected norm of the per-sample gradients. While
simplifying the analysis, this is however in sharp contrast with what empirical
evidence suggests to optimize performance. Our work bridges this gap between
theory and practice: we provide sharper rates for DP stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD) by crucially operating in a regime where clipping happens
frequently. Specifically, we consider the setting where the data is
multivariate Gaussian, the number of training samples $n$ is proportional to
the input dimension $d$, and the algorithm guarantees constant-order zero
concentrated DP. Our method relies on establishing a deterministic equivalent
for the trajectory of DP-SGD in terms of a family of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). As a consequence, the risk of DP-SGD is bounded between two
ODEs, with upper and lower bounds matching for isotropic data. By studying
these ODEs when $n / d$ is large enough, we demonstrate the optimality of
aggressive clipping, and we uncover the benefits of decaying learning rate and
private noise scheduling.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Schrödinger桥问题，提出了一种基于多元Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程的非平衡系统解法，并开发了高效算法mvOU-OTFM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多基于布朗运动，局限于势能驱动的系统，而生物系统通常处于非平衡状态，需要更通用的解法。

Method: 采用多元Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程作为参考过程，针对高斯边缘分布推导了解析解，并提出基于流和分数匹配的算法mvOU-OTFM。

Result: 在合成和真实单细胞数据上的实验表明，mvOU-OTFM比现有方法更准确且训练速度更快。

Conclusion: 该方法为非平衡系统的Schrödinger桥问题提供了高效解决方案，适用于生物系统等实际应用。

Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger bridge problem which, given ensemble
measurements of the initial and final configurations of a stochastic dynamical
system and some prior knowledge on the dynamics, aims to reconstruct the "most
likely" evolution of the system compatible with the data. Most existing
literature assume Brownian reference dynamics and are implicitly limited to
potential-driven dynamics. We depart from this regime and consider reference
processes described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with generic
drift matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$. When $\mathbf{A}$ is
asymmetric, this corresponds to a non-equilibrium system with non-conservative
forces at play: this is important for applications to biological systems, which
are naturally exist out-of-equilibrium. In the case of Gaussian marginals, we
derive explicit expressions that characterise the solution of both the static
and dynamic Schr\"odinger bridge. For general marginals, we propose mvOU-OTFM,
a simulation-free algorithm based on flow and score matching for learning the
Schr\"odinger bridge. In application to a range of problems based on synthetic
and real single cell data, we demonstrate that mvOU-OTFM achieves higher
accuracy compared to competing methods, whilst being significantly faster to
train.

Motivation: 研究二元线性分类问题中均匀泛化误差的集中性，以理解其统计行为。

Method: 使用等周论证建立Poincaré和对数Sobolev不等式，推导集中界，并进行渐近分析。

Result: 集中界在适度乘法常数下是尖锐的，且在比例高维等广泛设置中几乎必然收敛。

Conclusion: 证明了均匀大数定律在无维条件下成立，为高维统计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We examine the concentration of uniform generalization errors around their
expectation in binary linear classification problems via an isoperimetric
argument. In particular, we establish Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities
for the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input
vectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived
concentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those
under well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost
sure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs
in very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using
this convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under
dimension-free conditions.

Conclusion: 研究为数据点云的几何分析提供了新视角，并首次验证了网格细胞活动的几何保真性。

Abstract: We present a generalised Hanson-Wright inequality and use it to establish new
statistical insights into the geometry of data point-clouds. In the setting of
a general random function model of data, we clarify the roles played by three
notions of dimensionality: ambient intrinsic dimension $p_{\mathrm{int}}$,
which measures total variability across orthogonal feature directions;
correlation rank, which measures functional complexity across samples; and
latent intrinsic dimension, which is the dimension of manifold structure hidden
in data. Our analysis shows that in order for persistence diagrams to reveal
latent homology and for manifold structure to emerge it is sufficient that
$p_{\mathrm{int}}\gg \log n$, where $n$ is the sample size. Informed by these
theoretical perspectives, we revisit the ground-breaking neuroscience discovery
of toroidal structure in grid-cell activity made by Gardner et al. (Nature,
2022): our findings reveal, for the first time, evidence that this structure is
in fact isometric to physical space, meaning that grid cell activity conveys a
geometrically faithful representation of the real world.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效评估GNN显著性图的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNN显著性图的可靠性提供了统计验证，确保识别的显著子图具有实际意义。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to
process graph-structured data across various domains. However, interpreting GNN
decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency
maps for identifying influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the
reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of
their robustness to noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing
framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main
contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused
by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our
method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I
error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful
information rather than random artifacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
showing its effectiveness in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.

Conclusion: TULiP是一种有效的OOD检测方法，特别适用于近分布样本，为深度学习模型的安全部署提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: A reliable uncertainty estimation method is the foundation of many modern
out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors, which are critical for safe deployments of
deep learning models in the open world. In this work, we propose TULiP, a
theoretically-driven post-hoc uncertainty estimator for OOD detection. Our
approach considers a hypothetical perturbation applied to the network before
convergence. Based on linearized training dynamics, we bound the effect of such
perturbation, resulting in an uncertainty score computable by perturbing model
parameters. Ultimately, our approach computes uncertainty from a set of sampled
predictions. We visualize our bound on synthetic regression and classification
datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TULiP using
large-scale OOD detection benchmarks for image classification. Our method
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, particularly for near-distribution
samples.

Method: 在适当正则条件下，推导固定指标和超过阈值的临界点数量的渐近公式。

Result: 发现三种增长模式：收敛、多项式增长或指数增长，数值实验支持理论预测。

Conclusion: 当正则条件不满足时（如ReLU激活函数），临界点数量可能随分辨率增加而发散。

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random
neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in
the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive
precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed
index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three
distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the
covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge,
grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical
predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide
numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not
satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the
number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating
a potential divergence in the number of critical points.

Conclusion: 论文总结了关键挑战，并提出了未来研究方向，以实现TinyML和LargeML在下一代无线网络中的全面整合。

Abstract: The transition from 5G networks to 6G highlights a significant demand for
machine learning (ML). Deep learning models, in particular, have seen wide
application in mobile networking and communications to support advanced
services in emerging wireless environments, such as smart healthcare, smart
grids, autonomous vehicles, aerial platforms, digital twins, and the metaverse.
The rapid expansion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, many with limited
computational capabilities, has accelerated the development of tiny machine
learning (TinyML) and resource-efficient ML approaches for cost-effective
services. However, the deployment of large-scale machine learning (LargeML)
solutions require major computing resources and complex management strategies
to support extensive IoT services and ML-generated content applications.
Consequently, the integration of TinyML and LargeML is projected as a promising
approach for future seamless connectivity and efficient resource management.
  Although the integration of TinyML and LargeML shows abundant potential,
several challenges persist, including performance optimization, practical
deployment strategies, effective resource management, and security
considerations. In this survey, we review and analyze the latest research aimed
at enabling the integration of TinyML and LargeML models for the realization of
smart services and applications in future 6G networks and beyond. The paper
concludes by outlining critical challenges and identifying future research
directions for the holistic integration of TinyML and LargeML in
next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: Compound AI系统在6G网络中面临跨域资源协调、动态拓扑适应和异构环境中AI服务质量一致性的关键挑战。

Abstract: The 3D continuum presents a complex environment that spans the terrestrial,
aerial and space domains, with 6Gnetworks serving as a key enabling technology.
Current AI approaches for network management rely on monolithic models that
fail to capture cross-domain interactions, lack adaptability,and demand
prohibitive computational resources. This paper presents a formal model of
Compound AI systems, introducing a novel tripartite framework that decomposes
complex tasks into specialized, interoperable modules. The proposed modular
architecture provides essential capabilities to address the unique challenges
of 6G networks in the 3D continuum, where heterogeneous components require
coordinated, yet distributed, intelligence. This approach introduces a
fundamental trade-off between model and system performance, which must be
carefully addressed. Furthermore, we identify key challenges faced by Compound
AI systems within 6G networks operating in the 3D continuum, including
cross-domain resource orchestration, adaptation to dynamic topologies, and the
maintenance of consistent AI service quality across heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: PG-ZFO方法有效解决了DT模型动态变化带来的资源分配挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a quality of experience (QoE)-aware resource
allocation problem for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
digital twin (DT) interaction with uncertain evolution. In the considered
system, mobile users are expected to interact with a DT model maintained on a
DT server that is deployed on a base station, via effective uplink and downlink
channels assisted by an RIS. Our goal is to maximize the sum of all mobile
users' joint subjective and objective QoE in DT interactions across various DT
scenes, by jointly optimizing phase shift matrix, receive/transmit beamforming
matrix, rendering resolution configuration and computing resource allocation.
While solving this problem is challenging mainly due to the uncertain evolution
of the DT model, which leads to multiple scene-specific problems, and require
us to constantly re-solve each of them whenever DT model evolves.
  To this end, leveraging the dynamic optimization capabilities of decision
transformers and the generalization strengths of generative artificial
intelligence (GAI), we propose a novel GAI-aided approach, called the
prompt-guided decision transformer integrated with zero-forcing optimization
(PG-ZFO). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed PG-ZFO,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over counterparts.

Motivation: WiFi室内定位因信号衰减、多路径效应和设备差异等问题难以统一处理，需新方法提高精度。

Method: 使用生成预训练变换器（GPT）模型，捕捉无线遥测中的空间模式，无需手工信号处理。

Result: WiFiGPT在RSSI和FTM上实现亚米级精度，CSI上达到厘米级精度，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的定位方法潜力巨大，可超越专用技术，无需复杂校准。

Abstract: Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) based indoor positioning is a widely researched area
for determining the position of devices within a wireless network. Accurate
indoor location has numerous applications, such as asset tracking and indoor
navigation. Despite advances in WiFi localization techniques -- in particular
approaches that leverage WiFi telemetry -- their adoption in practice remains
limited due to several factors including environmental changes that cause
signal fading, multipath effects, interference, which, in turn, impact
positioning accuracy. In addition, telemetry data differs depending on the WiFi
device vendor, offering distinct features and formats; use case requirements
can also vary widely. Currently, there is no unified model to handle all these
variations effectively. In this paper, we present WiFiGPT, a Generative
Pretrained Transformer (GPT) based system that is able to handle these
variations while achieving high localization accuracy. Our experiments with
WiFiGPT demonstrate that GPTs, in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), can
effectively capture subtle spatial patterns in noisy wireless telemetry, making
them reliable regressors. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our
method matches and often surpasses conventional approaches for multiple types
of telemetry. Achieving sub-meter accuracy for RSSI and FTM and
centimeter-level precision for CSI demonstrates the potential of LLM-based
localisation to outperform specialized techniques, all without handcrafted
signal processing or calibration.

Result: 在3万条测试数据上，模型与真实消息的中位余弦相似度达0.97，比基线模型提升61%。

Conclusion: LAMs结合RAN特定推理可直接控制平面流程，为AI原生无线标准奠定基础。

Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to
redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous,
cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's
Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for
adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations
still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This
paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates
standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as
part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a
domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA
class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages
linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair
encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC
protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test
request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of
0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a
zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural
and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented
with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate
control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native
air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for
future AI-native wireless standards.

Result: 揭示了生命定义的连续性和多样性，表明生命定义问题应从二元分类转向统一概念空间。

Conclusion: 提供了一种结合还原论和整体论的方法，展示了计算语义分析在跨学科问题中的潜力。

Abstract: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers
for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery
of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear
on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of
biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single
definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge
becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial
intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it
means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a
curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation
analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by
agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection
to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a
continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life,
suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic
problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a
unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between
reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and
philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal
conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar
pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the
sciences.

based on reducing a complex classification problem of vectors of integer arrays
to a simpler classification problem of vectors of integers. The obtained

Conclusion: MDtrajNet-1突破了传统MD的速度限制，为高效原子模拟开辟新途径。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful tool for exploring the behavior of
atomistic systems, but its reliance on sequential numerical integration limits
simulation efficiency. We present MDtrajNet-1, a foundational AI model that
directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force
calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to
two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by
machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet-1 combines equivariant
neural networks with a Transformer-based architecture to achieve strong
accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories for both
known and unseen systems. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated
by MDtrajNet-1 for various molecular systems are close to those of the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器学习在弦景观和沼泽地研究中的应用，揭示复杂特征并分类模型。

Method: 使用自动编码器进行无监督学习压缩数据至2维，同时构建监督学习分类器预测模型一致性。

Result: 自动编码器成功分类模型并识别异常值；监督分类器在预测一致性方面表现良好（精度0.78和0.91）。

Conclusion: 机器学习能有效学习弦景观和沼泽地的复杂特征，为6维超重力理论提供新研究工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms to the study of the string landscape and swampland in 6-dimensions.
Our data are the (almost) anomaly-free 6-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$
supergravity models, characterised by the Gram matrix of anomaly coefficients.
Our work demonstrates the ability of machine learning algorithms to efficiently
learn highly complex features of the landscape and swampland. Employing an
autoencoder for unsupervised learning, we provide an auto-classification of
these models by compressing the Gram matrix data to 2-dimensions. Through
compression, similar models cluster together, and we identify prominent
features of these clusters. The autoencoder also identifies outlier models
which are difficult to reconstruct. One of these outliers proves to be
incredibly difficult to combine with other models such that the
$\text{tr}R^{4}$ anomaly vanishes, making its presence in the landscape
extremely rare. Further, we utilise supervised learning to build two
classifiers predicting (1) model consistency under probe string insertion
(precision: 0.78, predicting consistency for 214,837 models with reasonable
certainty) and (2) inconsistency under anomaly inflow (precision: 0.91,
predicting inconsistency for 1,909,359 models). Notably, projecting these
predictions onto the autoencoder's 2-dimensional latent layer shows consistent
models clustering together, further indicating that the autoencoder has learnt
interesting and complex features of the set of models and potentially offers a
novel approach to mapping the landscape and swampland of 6-dimensional
supergravity theories.

*Quan Minh Phan,Ngoc Hoang Luong*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于符号回归和遗传编程的自动化框架，用于设计零成本（ZC）指标，解决了现有ZC指标不一致和设计耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零成本（ZC）指标在神经架构搜索（NAS）中表现不一致且设计过程依赖人工试错，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用符号回归和遗传编程的框架，自动生成具有高扩展性和强正相关性的ZC指标。

Result: 在13个NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero问题上，自动生成的ZC指标表现优于人工设计的指标，并在15分钟内通过单GPU找到高性能网络架构。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化设计ZC指标提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了NAS的效率和效果。

Abstract: Estimating the network performance using zero-cost (ZC) metrics has proven
both its efficiency and efficacy in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However,
a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by
the substantial variation in their performance across different problems.
Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain
expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate
the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC
metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a
framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the
design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also
capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank
correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and
tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero
demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform
hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search
objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures
with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to drive innovation in complex,
decentralized environments, the need for scalable, adaptive, and
privacy-preserving decision-making systems has become critical. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining quantum-inspired neural networks with
evolutionary algorithms to optimize real-time decision-making in multi-agent
systems (MAS). The proposed Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Network (QE-NN)
leverages quantum computing principles -- such as quantum superposition and
entanglement -- to enhance learning speed and decision accuracy, while
integrating evolutionary optimization to continually refine agent behaviors in
dynamic, uncertain environments. By utilizing federated learning, QE-NN ensures
privacy preservation, enabling decentralized agents to collaborate without
sharing sensitive data. The framework is designed to allow agents to adapt in
real-time to their environments, optimizing decision-making processes for
applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and healthcare.
This research represents a breakthrough in merging quantum computing,
evolutionary optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques to solve complex
problems in multi-agent decision-making systems, pushing the boundaries of AI
in real-world, privacy-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: TDFormer是一种新型的脉冲神经网络模型，通过引入自上而下的反馈结构，提升了时间信息的传递和整合能力，显著提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的膜电位作为时间步间唯一的信息链接，限制了时间信息的有效表示，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 提出TDFormer模型，采用分层结构的自上而下反馈机制，利用早期时间步的高阶表示调节后期低阶信息的处理。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现优异，尤其在ImageNet上达到86.83%的准确率，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TDFormer通过反馈结构增强了时间信息的传递和梯度传播，显著提升了脉冲神经网络的性能。

Abstract: Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of
multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters
are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link
between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its
ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time
step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously
limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the
brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure
that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from
earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later
stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During
forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time
steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and
integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we
theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of
vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms
together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on
multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了SNN的能效优势和对抗鲁棒性，为嵌入式系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deployment of deep neural networks in resource-constrained embedded systems
requires innovative algorithmic solutions to facilitate their energy and memory
efficiency. To further ensure the reliability of these systems against
malicious actors, recent works have extensively studied adversarial robustness
of existing architectures. Our work focuses on the intersection of adversarial
robustness, memory- and energy-efficiency in neural networks. We introduce a
neural network conversion algorithm designed to produce sparse and
adversarially robust spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging the sparse
connectivity and weights from a robustly pretrained artificial neural network
(ANN). Our approach combines the energy-efficient architecture of SNNs with a
novel conversion algorithm, leading to state-of-the-art performance with
enhanced energy and memory efficiency through sparse connectivity and
activations. Our models are shown to achieve up to 100x reduction in the number
of weights to be stored in memory, with an estimated 8.6x increase in energy
efficiency compared to dense SNNs, while maintaining high performance and
robustness against adversarial threats.

Motivation: 手动设计车辆路径问题（VRP）的（元）启发式方法需要大量领域专业知识，而数据驱动方法虽然能自动学习启发式方法，但训练实例的选择仍是一个开放问题。

Method: CL-GPGLS结合课程学习（CL）和遗传编程（GP），通过逐步增加训练实例的复杂性来优化GLS中的效用函数。

Result: 实验表明，CL-GPGLS在性能上显著优于三种基线方法。

Conclusion: CL-GPGLS通过渐进式训练实例选择，有效提升了大尺度VRP的求解性能。

Abstract: Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is
a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently,
data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically
learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to
unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform
well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen
test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to
learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale
VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances
during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing
studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this,
we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL)
into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce
training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually
increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for
large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of
CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three
baseline methods.

Result: 研究表明Nheuristics在优化问题中具有潜力，但也面临设计和实现上的挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究以扩展Nheuristics的开发和应用范围。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NC) introduces a novel algorithmic paradigm
representing a major shift from traditional digital computing of Von Neumann
architectures. NC emulates or simulates the neural dynamics of brains in the
form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Much of the research in NC has
concentrated on machine learning applications and neuroscience simulations.
This paper investigates the modelling and implementation of optimization
algorithms and particularly metaheuristics using the NC paradigm as an
alternative to Von Neumann architectures, leading to breakthroughs in solving
optimization problems.
  Neuromorphic-based metaheuristics (Nheuristics) are supposed to be
characterized by low power, low latency and small footprint. Since NC systems
are fundamentally different from conventional Von Neumann computers, several
challenges are posed to the design and implementation of Nheuristics. A
guideline based on a classification and critical analysis is conducted on the
different families of metaheuristics and optimization problems they address. We
also discuss future directions that need to be addressed to expand both the
development and application of Nheuristics.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm
configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from
the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However,
applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial
optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents
a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a
Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the
objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance
the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that
our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration
methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous
generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to
different evolutionary computation methods.

Result: 与现有方法相比，提出的方法在节能方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 基于图形抽象的优化方法能有效提升蜂窝网络的节能效果。

Abstract: With increased 5G deployments, network densification is higher than ever to
support the exponentially high throughput requirements. However, this has meant
a significant increase in energy consumption, leading to higher operational
expenditure (OpEx) for network operators creating an acute need for
improvements in network energy savings (NES). A key determinant of operational
efficacy in cellular networks is the user association (UA) policy, as it
affects critical aspects like spectral efficiency, load balancing etc. and
therefore impacts the overall energy consumption of the network directly.
Furthermore, with cellular network topologies lending themselves well to
graphical abstractions, use of graphs in network optimization has gained
significant prominence. In this work, we propose and analyze a graphical
abstraction based optimization for UA in cellular networks to improve NES by
determining when energy saving features like cell switch off can be activated.
A comparison with legacy approaches establishes the superiority of the proposed
approach.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated significant potential
in enhancing single LLMs to address complex and diverse tasks in practical

integrates over 20 established methods across multiple domains, each rigorously
validated by comparing step-by-step outputs with its official implementation.
(2) MASLab provides a unified environment with various benchmarks for fair

MASLab, we conduct extensive experiments covering 10+ benchmarks and 8 models,

Abstract: Existing metrics often lack the granularity and interpretability to capture
nuanced clinical differences between candidate and ground-truth radiology
reports, resulting in suboptimal evaluation. We introduce a Clinically-grounded
tabular framework with Expert-curated labels and Attribute-level comparison for
Radiology report evaluation (CLEAR). CLEAR not only examines whether a report
can accurately identify the presence or absence of medical conditions, but also
assesses whether it can precisely describe each positively identified condition
across five key attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive
location, and recommendation. Compared to prior works, CLEAR's
multi-dimensional, attribute-level outputs enable a more comprehensive and
clinically interpretable evaluation of report quality. Additionally, to measure
the clinical alignment of CLEAR, we collaborate with five board-certified
radiologists to develop CLEAR-Bench, a dataset of 100 chest X-ray reports from
MIMIC-CXR, annotated across 6 curated attributes and 13 CheXpert conditions.
Our experiments show that CLEAR achieves high accuracy in extracting clinical
attributes and provides automated metrics that are strongly aligned with
clinical judgment.

Abstract: Media framing refers to the emphasis on specific aspects of perceived reality
to shape how an issue is defined and understood. Its primary purpose is to
shape public perceptions often in alignment with the authors' opinions and
stances. However, the interaction between stance and media frame remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we apply an interdisciplinary approach to
conceptualize and computationally explore this interaction with internet memes
on climate change. We curate CLIMATEMEMES, the first dataset of climate-change
memes annotated with both stance and media frames, inspired by research in
communication science. CLIMATEMEMES includes 1,184 memes sourced from 47
subreddits, enabling analysis of frame prominence over time and communities,
and sheds light on the framing preferences of different stance holders. We
propose two meme understanding tasks: stance detection and media frame
detection. We evaluate LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo in various setups, and report the
corresponding results on their LLM backbone. Human captions consistently
enhance performance. Synthetic captions and human-corrected OCR also help
occasionally. Our findings highlight that VLMs perform well on stance, but
struggle on frames, where LLMs outperform VLMs. Finally, we analyze VLMs'
limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions on climate change
internet memes.

Abstract: A key type of resource needed to address global inequalities in knowledge
production and dissemination is a tool that can support journals in
understanding how knowledge circulates. The absence of such a tool has resulted
in comparatively less information about networks of knowledge sharing in the
Global South. In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and
scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements
that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation
network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight
language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We
assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints
and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight
language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box,
today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the
constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all
fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is
likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such
a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus
meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further
metascientific research.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs的复杂推理能力，项目将公开。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) can significantly enhance the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with the key lying in the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. Previous methods typically
relied on simple features to measure the relevance between examples. We argue
that these features are not sufficient to reflect the intrinsic connections
between examples. In this study, we propose a curriculum ICL strategy guided by
problem-solving logic. We select demonstration examples by analyzing the
problem-solving logic and order them based on curriculum learning.
Specifically, we constructed a problem-solving logic instruction set based on
the BREAK dataset and fine-tuned a language model to analyze the
problem-solving logic of examples. Subsequently, we selected appropriate
demonstration examples based on problem-solving logic and assessed their
difficulty according to the number of problem-solving steps. In accordance with
the principles of curriculum learning, we ordered the examples from easy to
hard to serve as contextual prompts. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks indicate that our method outperforms previous ICL approaches in
terms of performance and efficiency, effectively enhancing the complex
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our project will be publicly available
subsequently.

Result: ULTRAEDIT在编辑速度上比现有最快方法快7倍以上，且资源消耗更低，支持百万级编辑并保持高准确性。

Conclusion: ULTRAEDIT在多种模型编辑场景中表现优异，是当前唯一能在消费级GPU上编辑7B LLM的方法。

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving
information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system
should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing
capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a
promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to
revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made
notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong
adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally
new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it
particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.
ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely
on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling
fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve
scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization
strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it
to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT
achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art
method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3
the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a
24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest
dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that
our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT
consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

TL;DR: BR-TaxQA-R是一个支持巴西个人所得税法问答的新数据集，结合RAG技术，在响应相关性上优于商业系统，但商业系统在事实准确性和流畅性上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为巴西个人所得税法领域提供高质量的问答支持，并验证RAG技术的有效性。

Method: 使用OpenAI嵌入和GPT-4o-mini构建RAG管道，比较不同文本分割策略，并与商业工具（如ChatGPT和Perplexity.ai）进行基准测试。

Result: 自定义RAG管道在响应相关性上表现更好，商业模型在事实准确性和流畅性上得分更高。

Conclusion: 在法律高风险领域，AI生成答案的法律有效性仍需人类专家评估，BR-TaxQA-R数据集已公开。

Abstract: This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question
answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law.
The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&A document
published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms
and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais
(CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using
OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We
compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against
commercial tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics.
Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in
Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while
commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency.
These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and
linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains
essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes
domains such as taxation. BR-TaxQA-R is publicly available at

Motivation: 探索LLMs在生成概率知识方面的潜力，尤其是在缺乏数据时如何利用其作为专家先验。

Method: 通过查询LLMs获取条件概率，参数化贝叶斯网络，并与随机、均匀分布等基线方法对比。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs提供的概率估计优于基线方法，并能减少系统偏差。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和小规模真实数据，为自动构建贝叶斯网络提供了一种有效策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge
bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about
real-world events remains understudied. This paper investigates using
probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for
statements concerning events and their interrelationships captured via a
Bayesian Network (BN). Using LLMs in this context allows for the
parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific
domains. Experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from
healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional
probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines,
including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on
next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived
distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from
minimal data, significantly reducing systematic biases. Overall, this work
introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian
Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with small
amounts of real-world data. Additionally, we evaluate several prompting
strategies for eliciting probabilistic knowledge from LLMs and establish the
first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting
probabilistic knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统神经语言模型中知识分布不透明、难以检查和更新的问题。

Method: 采用预训练方法，将事实知识存储在内部权重和外部数据库中，并通过屏蔽外部检索值训练模型进行目标查询。

Result: LMLM在标准基准测试中表现与更大的知识密集型模型相当，同时提供显式、可编辑和可验证的知识库。

Conclusion: LMLM代表了语言模型与事实知识交互和管理方式的根本性转变。

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and
factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This
entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update
specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory
Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge
in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically
masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby
teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on
memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve
competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs
on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable,
and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how
language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of
artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language
models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like
Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated
dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This
study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model
by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical
magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient QA pairs. We fine-tuned a
baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge.
Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved
accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared
to its baseline. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access
online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a
novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何利用因果可解释性方法分析大型语言模型（LLMs），以增强其对语言学理论的贡献，特别是在英语填充-缺口依赖结构的研究中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs为语言学家提供了强大的证据来源，但通过因果可解释性方法可以进一步揭示LLMs学习的抽象机制，从而推动语言学理论的发展。

Method: 采用分布式交换干预实验，分析LLMs对英语填充-缺口依赖结构（如疑问句、关系从句）的抽象分析。

Result: LLMs对这些结构表现出相似的抽象分析，并揭示了频率、填充类型和上下文等被忽视的因素，可能影响语言学理论。

Conclusion: LLMs的机制性内部分析有助于推动语言学理论的进步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for
linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that
causal interpretability methods, applied to LLMs, can greatly enhance the value
of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LLMs
learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency
constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely
agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based
in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar
abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously
overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding
context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall,
these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LLMs can push
linguistic theory forward.

TL;DR: LLM-as-a-Judge范式提供了一种可扩展、无参考的语言模型评估方法，但现有校准技术在现实开放任务中表现不佳。SLMEval通过熵最大化和少量人类偏好数据，显著提升了与人类判断的相关性，并降低了评估成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准技术主要针对结构化基准，无法推广到现实开放任务，导致与人类判断相关性低甚至负相关。

Method: 提出SLMEval，基于熵最大化和少量人类偏好数据，通过估计模型质量的潜在分布并重新加权评分。

Result: SLMEval在现实任务和公共基准上均表现出与人类判断的强相关性（如Spearman相关系数0.57），且评估成本降低5-30倍。

Conclusion: SLMEval是一种高效且通用的校准方法，显著提升了LLM评估的准确性和成本效益。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for
evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been
proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies
focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains
unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.
  In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these
settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To
address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method
based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By
estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator
scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations
across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For
example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with
human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition,
SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated
evaluators such as G-eval.

TL;DR: LAGO是一种基于语言相似性的图优化方法，用于少样本跨语言嵌入反转攻击，显著提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言NLP系统中隐私漏洞问题，利用语言相似性提升攻击效果。

Method: 通过图优化框架建模语言关系，结合句法和词汇相似性约束，实现跨语言参数协作学习。

Result: 实验显示LAGO在Rouge-L分数上比基线提升10-20%，验证了语言相似性对攻击可迁移性的重要性。

Conclusion: 语言相似性是跨语言嵌入反转攻击的关键因素，需关注语言感知的隐私保护嵌入方法。

Abstract: We propose LAGO - Language Similarity-Aware Graph Optimization - a novel
approach for few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks, addressing
critical privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems. Unlike prior work
in embedding inversion attacks that treat languages independently, LAGO
explicitly models linguistic relationships through a graph-based constrained
distributed optimization framework. By integrating syntactic and lexical
similarity as edge constraints, our method enables collaborative parameter
learning across related languages. Theoretically, we show this formulation
generalizes prior approaches, such as ALGEN, which emerges as a special case
when similarity constraints are relaxed. Our framework uniquely combines
Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation
constraints, ensuring robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces even
with extremely limited data (as few as 10 samples per language). Extensive
experiments across multiple languages and embedding models demonstrate that
LAGO substantially improves the transferability of attacks with 10-20% increase
in Rouge-L score over baselines. This work establishes language similarity as a
critical factor in inversion attack transferability, urging renewed focus on
language-aware privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.

TL;DR: NOVER是一种无需外部验证器的强化学习框架，仅需标准监督微调数据，适用于多种文本任务，性能优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激励训练方法依赖外部验证器，限制了其适用范围，且验证器成本高。

Method: 提出NOVER框架，无需外部验证器，仅需标准监督微调数据。

Result: NOVER在多种任务中表现优异，性能提升7.7%。

Conclusion: NOVER为优化大语言模型提供了新可能，如逆向激励训练。

Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of
incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards
solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby
encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these
methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their
applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are
readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require
high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose
NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning
framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need
for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range
of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from
large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the
flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language
models, such as inverse incentive training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量BPE分词器对日期分片化的指标，并发布了一个包含6500个例子的测试集DateAugBench，通过实验发现日期分片化会影响模型性能，且大模型能更快地修复分片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代BPE分词器会将日期分割成无意义的片段，影响时间推理的准确性，因此需要量化这种分片化现象并研究其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 1. 提出日期分片化比率指标；2. 发布DateAugBench测试集；3. 通过分层探测和因果注意力分析研究模型如何修复分片化问题。

Result: 实验表明，过度分片化会导致罕见日期（如历史或未来日期）的准确率下降10%，且大模型能更快地修复分片化问题。

Conclusion: 日期分片化对时间推理有负面影响，但大模型能更快地通过注意力机制修复分片化问题，且其推理路径与人类不同。

Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments,
e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring
the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we
(1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation
ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date
components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three
temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance
puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future
regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses,
uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models
stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal
reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with
accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and
futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the
emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we
observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically
differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$
day).

Motivation: 简化健康信息对健康生活至关重要，但生成式AI可能遗漏关键内容，影响理解。

Method: 收集50篇健康信息，用GPT-4简化，比较五种方法（添加缺失实体、单词等）修复文本，评估语义相似性和内容重叠。

Result: 添加所有缺失实体的方法在文本重建中表现最佳，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 当前工具能识别缺失实体，但无法有效排序其重要性。

Abstract: Understanding health information is essential in achieving and maintaining a
healthy life. We focus on simplifying health information for better
understanding. With the availability of generative AI, the simplification
process has become efficient and of reasonable quality, however, the algorithms
remove information that may be crucial for comprehension. In this study, we
compare generative AI to detect missing information in simplified text,
evaluate its importance, and fix the text with the missing information. We
collected 50 health information texts and simplified them using gpt-4-0613. We
compare five approaches to identify missing elements and regenerate the text by
inserting the missing elements. These five approaches involve adding missing
entities and missing words in various ways: 1) adding all the missing entities,
2) adding all missing words, 3) adding the top-3 entities ranked by gpt-4-0613,
and 4, 5) serving as controls for comparison, adding randomly chosen entities.
We use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate the semantic similarity
and content overlap between the original, simplified, and reconstructed
simplified text. We do this for both summaries and full text. Overall, we find
that adding missing entities improves the text. Adding all the missing entities
resulted in better text regeneration, which was better than adding the
top-ranked entities or words, or random words. Current tools can identify these
entities, but are not valuable in ranking them.

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源环境下个性化术语检测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了用户自适应NLP系统的实用化。

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making
technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary
backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires
substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific
finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized
jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for
real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1)
lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models,
and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time
without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid
approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user
background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in
F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably,
our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated
training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained
settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient,
low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language
models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LIFEBench基准测试，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在遵循长度指令方面的能力，发现多数模型在短长度任务中表现尚可，但在长长度任务中表现急剧下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能解决复杂的推理问题，但在遵循明确长度指令（如生成特定长度的文本）时表现不佳，现有基准测试未充分评估这一能力。

Method: 提出了LIFEBench基准测试，包含10,800个实例，涵盖4种任务类别和多种长度要求（16到8192词），评估了26种常用LLM。

Result: 大多数模型在短长度任务中表现合理，但在长长度任务中表现显著下降；几乎所有模型无法达到厂商声称的最大输出长度；推理型LLM表现优于专用长文本生成模型。

Conclusion: LIFEBench揭示了当前LLM在遵循长度指令方面的根本局限性，为未来改进提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems
over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task:
following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel.
Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate
prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on
evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet
length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following
Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to
follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified
lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in
both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192
words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably
follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain
threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed
maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations
extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended
input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions
following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall,
LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions
following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

Abstract: Interpreting figurative language such as sarcasm across multi-modal inputs
presents unique challenges, often requiring task-specific fine-tuning and
extensive reasoning steps. However, current Chain-of-Thought approaches do not
efficiently leverage the same cognitive processes that enable humans to
identify sarcasm. We present IRONIC, an in-context learning framework that
leverages Multi-modal Coherence Relations to analyze referential, analogical
and pragmatic image-text linkages. Our experiments show that IRONIC achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection across
different baselines. This demonstrates the need for incorporating linguistic
and cognitive insights into the design of multi-modal reasoning strategies. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Transformer Copilot的新框架，通过记录模型的学习行为（Mistake Log）并设计Copilot模型来优化Pilot模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法仅关注生成损失的最小化，而忽略了模型自身的学习信号。本文旨在通过类似人类学习的方式，利用模型的学习信号提升性能。

Method: 1. 引入Mistake Log记录模型学习行为；2. 设计Copilot模型通过logits校正优化Pilot模型；3. 提出联合训练和融合推理范式。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，Transformer Copilot性能提升最高达34.5%，且计算开销低，具有强扩展性和迁移性。

Conclusion: Transformer Copilot通过利用模型自身学习信号，显著提升了性能，同时保持了高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through
supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning
focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a
deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals,
analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future
performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically
track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout
fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we
correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference
performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot
framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model
design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns
from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference
paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced
generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new
learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense,
arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot
consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal
computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and
transferability.

*Chenzhuo Zhao,Ziqian Liu,Xingda Wang,Junting Lu,Chaoyi Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PMPO是一种轻量级提示优化框架，通过交叉熵损失直接评估提示质量，无需输出生成或人工标注，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法依赖高成本输出生成或人工标注，限制了其可扩展性，尤其是对小模型或非指令调优模型。

Method: PMPO利用交叉熵损失评估提示质量，通过掩码和损失最小化优化提示，支持监督和偏好任务。

Result: PMPO在BBH、GSM8K等任务上表现优异，AlpacaEval 2.0胜率提升19点以上。

Conclusion: PMPO高效、通用，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to
fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However,
existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing
abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability,
especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO
(Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines
prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight
evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and
measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by
minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it
requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying
only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and
preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation
strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods
across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH,
performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates
by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency,
and broad applicability.

*Wenqing Wu,Chengzhi Zhang,Tong Bao,Yi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过学术论文的不同核心部分组合来评估其新颖性，发现引言、结果和讨论部分最适合预测新颖性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注词汇或实体组合，对新颖性评估的洞察有限，而论文新颖性内容通常分布在多个核心部分，因此探索最优部分组合对自动化评估至关重要。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术识别论文的IMRaD结构，以不同部分组合作为预训练语言模型和大语言模型的输入，以人类专家评分作为真实标签预测新颖性分数。

Result: 引言、结果和讨论部分最适合评估新颖性，而全文输入效果不显著；引言和结果部分对新颖性预测最为重要。

Conclusion: 论文确定了评估学术论文新颖性的最优部分组合，并提供了相关代码和数据集。

Abstract: Novelty is a core component of academic papers, and there are multiple
perspectives on the assessment of novelty. Existing methods often focus on word
or entity combinations, which provide limited insights. The content related to
a paper's novelty is typically distributed across different core sections,
e.g., Introduction, Methodology and Results. Therefore, exploring the optimal
combination of sections for evaluating the novelty of a paper is important for
advancing automated novelty assessment. In this paper, we utilize different
combinations of sections from academic papers as inputs to drive language
models to predict novelty scores. We then analyze the results to determine the
optimal section combinations for novelty score prediction. We first employ
natural language processing techniques to identify the sectional structure of
academic papers, categorizing them into introduction, methods, results, and
discussion (IMRaD). Subsequently, we used different combinations of these
sections (e.g., introduction and methods) as inputs for pretrained language
models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), employing novelty scores
provided by human expert reviewers as ground truth labels to obtain prediction
results. The results indicate that using introduction, results and discussion
is most appropriate for assessing the novelty of a paper, while the use of the
entire text does not yield significant results. Furthermore, based on the
results of the PLMs and LLMs, the introduction and results appear to be the
most important section for the task of novelty score prediction. The code and
dataset for this paper can be accessed at

*Benjamin Vendeville,Liana Ermakova,Pierre De Loor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于检测和分类简化文本错误的测试集，填补了自动文本简化（ATS）评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众常因复杂文本难以理解而传播错误信息，而现有的ATS评估方法未能跟上生成模型的进步，尤其是大语言模型（LLMs）。

Method: 提出错误分类法，构建并行数据集并人工标注，分析数据集质量及现有模型在错误检测中的表现。

Result: 提供了工具以更准确地评估ATS中的错误，帮助开发更可靠的模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进自动简化文本质量提供了重要资源和方法。

Abstract: The general public often encounters complex texts but does not have the time
or expertise to fully understand them, leading to the spread of misinformation.
Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) helps make information more accessible, but
its evaluation methods have not kept up with advances in text generation,
especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent studies
have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of
errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors,
underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is
currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test
collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we
propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion.
Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific
texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed
taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the
performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that
taxonomy. These contributions give researchers the tools to better evaluate
errors in ATS, develop more reliable models, and ultimately improve the quality
of automatically simplified texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-Star是一个基于强化学习的框架，旨在提升大语言模型（LLMs）在多工具协作推理中的能力。通过数据合成和两阶段训练，解决了工具使用数据稀缺和协作效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在强化学习下表现出强大推理能力，但多工具协作推理仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出数据合成管道生成工具使用轨迹，并通过两阶段训练（冷启动微调和多工具自评RL算法）优化协作推理。

Result: 在10多个推理基准测试中验证了Tool-Star的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Star为LLMs的多工具协作推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning
capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging
the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in
LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an
RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple
external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of
tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training.
To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated
reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting
with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use
trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware
classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the
dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training
framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start
fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via
tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with
hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes
effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging
reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Jensen-Shannon散度的方法（ARC-JSD），用于高效准确地识别生成内容的关键上下文句子，无需额外微调或代理建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将生成内容可靠地归因于特定上下文时，计算成本高且依赖微调或人工标注，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入ARC-JSD方法，利用Jensen-Shannon散度直接识别关键上下文句子，避免额外计算开销。

Result: 在多个RAG基准测试中表现优于现有代理方法，显著提升计算效率，并揭示了模型内部负责上下文归因的注意力头和MLP层。

Conclusion: ARC-JSD为RAG模型提供了一种高效准确的上下文归因方法，同时揭示了模型内部机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs)
combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of
generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to
specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the
computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require
extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel
Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context
(ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context
sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on
a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using
instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous
surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific
attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context
attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种语言驱动的框架，将程序性文本转化为连贯的视觉指令，解决了纯文本难以传达复杂动作和空间关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序性知识的有效传达是NLP中的一大挑战，纯文本指令难以表达复杂的物理动作和空间关系。

Method: 通过分解目标陈述和顺序步骤，建模指令的语言结构，并结合三种创新：基于成分解析器的文本编码机制、成对语篇连贯性模型和新的评估协议。

Result: 在三个指令数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成准确反映指令内容和顺序的视觉内容上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该研究为程序性语言的视觉内容基础提供了贡献，适用于教育、任务指导和多模态语言理解等领域。

Abstract: The effective communication of procedural knowledge remains a significant
challenge in natural language processing (NLP), as purely textual instructions
often fail to convey complex physical actions and spatial relationships. We
address this limitation by proposing a language-driven framework that
translates procedural text into coherent visual instructions. Our approach
models the linguistic structure of instructional content by decomposing it into
goal statements and sequential steps, then conditioning visual generation on
these linguistic elements. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a
constituency parser-based text encoding mechanism that preserves semantic
completeness even with lengthy instructions, (2) a pairwise discourse coherence
model that maintains consistency across instruction sequences, and (3) a novel
evaluation protocol specifically designed for procedural language-to-image
alignment. Our experiments across three instructional datasets (HTStep,
CaptainCook4D, and WikiAll) demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in generating visuals that accurately reflect
the linguistic content and sequential nature of instructions. This work
contributes to the growing body of research on grounding procedural language in
visual content, with applications spanning education, task guidance, and
multimodal language understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪枝技术虽然能压缩模型，但会导致安全性下降，因此需要一种方法在剪枝后恢复模型的安全性。

Method: HSR通过量化每个注意力头对安全性的贡献，识别关键注意力头，并选择性恢复其中的关键神经元，分层重新对齐安全性。

Result: 在不同模型和剪枝策略下验证，HSR显著提升了安全性性能。

Conclusion: HSR是首个专注于剪枝后恢复LVLMs安全性的工作，效果显著。

Abstract: With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network
pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in
resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However,
we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To
address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed
Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the
contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical
ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention
heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process
hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the
attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models
and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety
performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on
restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

TL;DR: RecInter是一个基于代理的推荐系统模拟平台，通过动态交互机制提升模拟真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统A/B测试资源密集，离线方法难以捕捉动态用户-平台交互，现有模拟平台缺乏动态环境重塑机制。

Method: 引入RecInter平台，模拟用户行为实时更新物品属性，支持商家代理互动，采用多维用户画像、高级代理架构和LLM微调技术。

Result: 平台显著提升模拟可信度，成功复现品牌忠诚度和马太效应等涌现现象。

Conclusion: RecInter为推荐系统研究提供了可信的测试平台，动态交互机制对模拟系统演化至关重要。

Abstract: Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional
A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic
user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing
platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the
environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based
simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction
mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews,
purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced
Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem.
High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling
module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved
simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like
Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this
interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution,
establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems
research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型的位置偏见及其与语言多样性的关系，发现模型驱动的偏见在不同语言中表现不同，且显式位置引导会降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型在不同语言中的位置偏见及其与模型不确定性、语法和提示的交互作用。

Method: 对五种类型不同的语言（英语、俄语、德语、印地语、越南语）进行跨语言研究，分析位置偏见与模型行为的关系。

Result: 发现位置偏见是模型驱动的，语言间存在差异；显式位置引导降低准确性；上下文对齐增加熵，但熵与准确性无关；LLMs在自由语序语言中强加主导词序。

Conclusion: 位置偏见是模型特性，提示工程需谨慎，语言多样性影响模型行为。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of
information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic
diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across
five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi,
Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty,
syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with
language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging
assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g.,
correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages,
undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional
bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We
further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in
free-word-order languages like Hindi.

Motivation: 探索在多语言环境下（28种语言）进行多标签情感分类的最佳方法，比较不同策略和模型的性能。

Method: 采用两种主要策略：完全微调Transformer模型和仅训练分类器，评估了微调策略、模型架构、损失函数、编码器和分类器的不同设置。

Result: 基于提示的编码器（如mE5和BGE）表现优于完全微调的XLMR和mBERT，集成多个BGE模型（使用CatBoost分类器）的平均F1分数为56.58。

Conclusion: 在多语言多标签情感分类任务中，基于提示的编码器结合集成方法是一种有效的策略。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for SemEval 2025 Task 11 Track A, focusing
on multilabel emotion classification across 28 languages. We explore two main
strategies: fully fine-tuning transformer models and classifier-only training,
evaluating different settings such as fine-tuning strategies, model
architectures, loss functions, encoders, and classifiers. Our findings suggest
that training a classifier on top of prompt-based encoders such as mE5 and BGE
yields significantly better results than fully fine-tuning XLMR and mBERT. Our
best-performing model on the final leaderboard is an ensemble combining
multiple BGE models, where CatBoost serves as the classifier, with different
configurations. This ensemble achieves an average F1-macro score of 56.58
across all languages.

Conclusion: CANOE框架有效提升LLM生成内容的忠实度，无需人工标注，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context
is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we
propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in
both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations.
Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with
four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training
data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based
reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards
derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing
both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO
eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models
and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the
synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly
improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even
outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在情感分析中表现出色，但对它们如何捕捉情感信息的理解仍有限。

Method: 使用探测分类器分析情感编码在不同层和尺度上的分布，确定最佳捕捉情感信号的层和池化方法。

Result: 情感信息在二分类任务中集中在中间层，检测准确率提高14%，且解码器模型的最后一个标记并非最有效。内存需求平均减少57%。

Conclusion: 层特异性探测是情感任务的有效方法，可提升模型效用并减少资源消耗。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP,
demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting
techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited
understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This
study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment
features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment
analysis.
  Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and
scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment
signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in
mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to
14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only
models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment
encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with
memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.
  These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs,
suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks
beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory
requirements.

Motivation: 语言模型（LMs）在知识密集型任务中可能忽略或误用上下文信息，现有CMTs缺乏系统性比较。

Method: 开发CUB基准，测试七种代表性CMTs在三种上下文类型和多样化数据集上的表现。

Result: 多数CMTs难以处理真实场景中的多样化上下文，且在合成数据集上表现虚高。

Conclusion: 需开发能处理多种上下文类型的CMTs，并进行更全面的测试。

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks,
such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs)
may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or
be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation
manipulation techniques (CMTs) that encourage or suppress context utilisation
have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic
comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) to
help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) identify the
best CMT for their needs. CUB allows for rigorous testing on three distinct
context types, observed to capture key challenges in realistic context
utilisation scenarios. With this benchmark, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse
datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results show that most of the
existing CMTs struggle to handle the full set of types of contexts that may be
encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. Moreover, we find that
many CMTs display an inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets,
compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples.
Altogether, our results show the need for holistic tests of CMTs and the
development of CMTs that can handle multiple context types.

Result: 分析发现先前研究结论部分成立，但对LLM生成数据集的泛化仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or
fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false
statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness.
However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism,
which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text
generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of
previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to
the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we
extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible
true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for
generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering
collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the
findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to
LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for
future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more
effective evaluation.

Motivation: 现有LLM在推理中仍存在偏差，导致泛化能力差。现有基准通常只关注单一偏差，而实际应用中数据可能包含多类型偏差。

Method: 提出多偏差基准，每份数据包含五种偏差。开发CMBE方法，通过因果效应估计同时消除多类型偏差。

Result: 实验表明，现有LLM和去偏方法在多偏差基准上表现不佳，而CMBE能有效消除多类型偏差。

Conclusion: CMBE能显著提升LLM的泛化能力，为多偏差消除提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current
large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading
to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to
investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically
containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may
contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types
of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the
performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying,
highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases
simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect
estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first
estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously.
Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal
effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference.
Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of
bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在零样本范式下表现不佳，但通过上下文学习（ICL）优化演示配置，验证了其情感分析能力，准确率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在零样本范式下无法胜任多模态情感分析（MSA）的原因，并验证其潜在能力。

Method: 扩展零样本范式至ICL，研究演示的检索、呈现和分布三个关键因素，并发现并抵消MLLMs的情感预测偏差。

Result: 在六个MSA数据集上，优化策略使平均准确率比零样本范式提升15.9%，比随机ICL基线提升11.2%。

Conclusion: MLLMs通过ICL优化配置可以胜任MSA任务，验证了其情感感知能力。

Abstract: The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This
paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend
in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a
pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to
accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable
performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as
competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to
In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring
demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability.
Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval,
presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized.
A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later
effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies
for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA
datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL
baseline.

TL;DR: O²-Searcher是一个基于强化学习的搜索代理，旨在解决开放域中的开放性和封闭性问题，通过动态知识获取和统一训练机制显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的静态知识限制了其在开放域任务中的表现，尤其是开放性问题。现有方法主要针对封闭性问题，开放性问题研究不足。

Method: 提出O²-Searcher，利用强化学习在本地模拟搜索环境中动态获取知识，设计统一训练机制和奖励函数，区分问题类型并调整回答策略。

Result: O²-Searcher在3B模型下显著优于其他LLM代理，在开放性问题基准O²-QA上表现优异，同时在封闭性问题基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: O²-Searcher通过动态知识获取和强化学习，有效解决了开放性和封闭性问题，为LLM在开放域任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally
limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks
requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact
with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts
primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which
characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse
answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a
novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both
open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher
leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic
knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from
model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training
mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to
identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies.
Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct
O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain
open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments
show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses
leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various
closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on
par with much larger ones.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低资源环境下个性化翻译的挑战，揭示了模型层在个性化中的相似机制。

Abstract: High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models
(LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting
specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in
settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to
convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing
LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the
challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and
inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a
personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent
concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization
properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization
while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering
on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for
personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering
method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PaTH是一种基于数据依赖的Householder变换的位置编码方法，相比RoPE和其他基线方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE的位置编码仅依赖于相对位置，限制了其表达能力，因此需要更灵活的数据依赖位置编码方案。

Method: 提出PaTH，利用数据依赖的Householder变换构建位置编码，并设计了高效的并行训练算法和FlashAttention风格的块级算法以减少I/O开销。

Result: 在合成基准测试和实际语言建模实验中，PaTH表现优于RoPE和其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PaTH通过数据依赖的位置编码提升了模型的表达能力，是一种有效的位置编码方案。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models
(LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant,
position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as
language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard
approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in
RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a
function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual
input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme
based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each
transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an
efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact
representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a
FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both
targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling
experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to
RoPE and other recent baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的机器翻译专用大语言模型依赖昂贵且难以扩展的外部监督信号，如人工标注数据或奖励模型。

Method: 提出Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR)强化学习框架，完全在线且无需参考数据，仅通过自我判断奖励进行训练。

Result: SSR-Zero-7B模型在多个基准测试中超越现有模型，结合外部监督后达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 自我奖励机制在机器翻译中有效，与外部奖励模型结合时表现更优，为自我改进强化学习方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific
LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as
human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often
expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging
rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as
the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs,
e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks
from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR
with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B,
achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese
translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters
and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.
Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism
compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its
complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide
valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have
publicly released our code, data and models.

Motivation: 当前强化学习主要关注单轮任务，而多轮网页交互的复杂性使得训练有效的网页代理具有挑战性。

Method: WebAgent-R1通过异步生成多样化的轨迹，完全依赖任务成功的二元奖励，直接从在线网页交互中学习。

Result: 在WebArena-Lite基准测试中，WebAgent-R1将Qwen-2.5-3B和Llama-3.1-8B的任务成功率分别从6.1%提升至33.9%和8.5%提升至44.8%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于思考的提示策略和测试时扩展交互对网页任务有效，同时行为克隆和长链推理在初始化策略中起重要作用。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn
tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for
multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of
long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we
present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework
for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web
environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided
by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite
benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task
success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to
44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong
proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the
effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling
through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different
RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero
and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training
stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

Abstract: Empowered by vast internal knowledge reservoir, the new generation of large

However, there is insufficient effort made towards summoning up a synergic
effect from multiple LLMs' expertise and background. In this study, we propose
a multi-LLM collaboration framework tailored on a medical multiple-choice
questions dataset. Through post-hoc analysis on 3 pre-trained LLM participants,
our framework is proved to boost all LLMs reasoning ability as well as
alleviate their divergence among questions. We also measure an LLM's confidence
when it confronts with adversary opinions from other LLMs and observe a
concurrence between LLM's confidence and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese
ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for
evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses
the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models
under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through
machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems
were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on
the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and
difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous
problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were
designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese
mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially
comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains
inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models'
classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized
for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining
mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional
culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and
cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

Method: 扩展了复制任务为上下文元学习任务，分析模型电路动态，识别多阶段能力获取过程。

Result: 发现模型在获取元学习能力时经历多个阶段，每个阶段出现独特电路，与单阶段变化的归纳头形成对比。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer上下文学习能力的来源，深化了对模型动态的理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where
predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links
induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account
for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important
property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn
how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context;
how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this
paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by
analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we
extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning
setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries.
Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the
process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each
phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The
emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large
language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source
of the transformer's ICL ability.

TL;DR: TRIM是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）的新型剪枝方法，通过维度稀疏化优化，显著提升模型效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一刀切剪枝方法在高稀疏率下表现不佳，需要更精细的剪枝策略。

Method: TRIM采用迭代调整过程，根据质量指标为每个输出维度分配不同的稀疏率，减少信息损失。

Result: 在多种LLM上，TRIM在80%稀疏率下显著降低困惑度，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 维度稀疏化是极端LLM压缩的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory
challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their
efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform
sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in
suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work
introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel
approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions
(rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided
by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on
reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical
information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning
strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse
LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that
TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For
instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and
over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that
fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the
limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at:

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据集设计对模型安全的重要性，并提出了改进防御策略的方向。

Abstract: As large language models gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks remains a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific
datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce
vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate
Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from
characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential
correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and
toxicity within our experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial
performance of these fine-tuned models and assess how dataset factors correlate
with attack success rates. Lastly, we explore potential causal links, offering
new insights into adversarial defense strategies and highlighting the crucial

Motivation: 现有遗忘评估方法依赖词级指标，可能掩盖信息而非真正删除，需更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 引入基于PCA相似性、中心核对齐和Fisher信息的表示层面评估框架，分析六种遗忘方法、三种领域和两种开源LLM。

Result: 发现可逆遗忘中模型保留潜在特征，不可逆遗忘中表示层受损；任务类型和超参数调节可逆性。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在根本缺陷，提出新诊断工具为LLM可信遗忘奠定基础。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is intended to remove the
influence of specific data, yet current evaluations rely heavily on token-level
metrics such as accuracy and perplexity. We show that these metrics can be
misleading: models often appear to forget, but their original behavior can be
rapidly restored with minimal fine-tuning, revealing that unlearning may
obscure information rather than erase it. To diagnose this phenomenon, we
introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based
similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information.
Applying this toolkit across six unlearning methods, three domains (text, code,
math), and two open-source LLMs, we uncover a critical distinction between
reversible and irreversible forgetting. In reversible cases, models suffer
token-level collapse yet retain latent features; in irreversible cases, deeper
representational damage occurs. We further provide a theoretical account
linking shallow weight perturbations near output layers to misleading
unlearning signals, and show that reversibility is modulated by task type and
hyperparameters. Our findings reveal a fundamental gap in current evaluation
practices and establish a new diagnostic foundation for trustworthy unlearning
in LLMs. We provide a unified toolkit for analyzing LLM representation changes
under unlearning and relearning:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数PDL，通过根据词频调整权重，优化文本生成任务的微调过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失对所有词元平等对待，导致模型过度关注高频低信息词元，而忽略低频高信息词元。PDL的动机源于信息论和语言学观察：词元的信息量通常与其出现频率成反比。

Method: PDL基于词频对标准交叉熵损失中的词元贡献进行重新加权，遵循幂律衰减。高频词元权重降低，低频高信息词元权重增加。

Result: PDL引导模型在微调过程中更关注学习生成具有特定和独特信息的词元，从而提升生成文本的质量、多样性和信息量。

Conclusion: PDL在抽象摘要、对话系统和风格转换等文本生成任务中具有潜在应用和优势。

Abstract: During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy
loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize
high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens
crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper
introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically
designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core
motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and
linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to
its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in
the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus,
following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency
tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned
higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more
on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information,
thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated
text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and
discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text
generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue
systems, and style transfer.

Motivation: 传统方法需要人工标注大量行为属性，效率低下，因此需要一种自动化方法来挖掘和优化语言模型的潜在原则。

Method: 采用后验正则化的蒙特卡洛期望最大化方法，从语言模型中挖掘并压缩潜在原则，通过自校正迭代提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使小模型在AlpacaEval中胜率提升8-10%，MT-Bench平均提升0.3分，IFEval中原则遵循胜率提升19-23%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了自动化原则驱动的后训练方法在持续自我改进中的潜力。

Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations,
it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should
strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even
non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate
this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model
reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a
self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself
and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering.
Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo
Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective
latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to
intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our
algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B
parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an
average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on
IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and
diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The
gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated,
principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在多步推理和信息检索中存在训练数据质量低、模拟环境分布不匹配以及计算成本高的问题。

Method: 通过模拟真实用户交互和多标准数据筛选策略，生成高质量训练数据，采用监督微调（SFT）方法。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，仅用871个样本的SFT表现优于基于强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: SimpleDeepSearcher通过解决数据稀缺问题，为高效深度搜索系统提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language
models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning
and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical
limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the
distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive
computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces
SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap
through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our
approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user
interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria
curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output
side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that
SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based
baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically
addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for
efficient deep search systems. Our code is available at

Conclusion: BP-Seg是一种高效的文本分割方法，能够同时处理局部和全局语义关系。

Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental
task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we
propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg
for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence,
capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but
also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically
similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully
constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative
example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method
performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理中资源管理的挑战，因自回归文本生成的长度随机性和变异性导致资源分配困难。

Method: 通过生成10个独立完成样本，记录响应长度，并发布统计数据和生成设置。

Result: 发现模型间和模型内响应长度存在显著变异性，部分响应出现文本退化现象。

Conclusion: CASTILLO为预测模型开发和生成行为分析提供了系统框架，并公开数据集和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Efficiently managing compute resources for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference remains challenging due to the inherently stochastic and variable
lengths of autoregressive text generation. Accurately estimating response
lengths in advance enables proactive resource allocation, yet existing
approaches either bias text generation towards certain lengths or rely on
assumptions that ignore model- and prompt-specific variability. We introduce
CASTILLO, a dataset characterizing response length distributions across 13
widely-used open-source LLMs evaluated on seven distinct instruction-following
corpora. For each $\langle$prompt, model$\rangle$ sample pair, we generate 10
independent completions using fixed decoding hyper-parameters, record the token
length of each response, and publish summary statistics (mean, std-dev,
percentiles), along with the shortest and longest completions, and the exact
generation settings. Our analysis reveals significant inter- and intra-model
variability in response lengths (even under identical generation settings), as
well as model-specific behaviors and occurrences of partial text degeneration
in only subsets of responses. CASTILLO enables the development of predictive
models for proactive scheduling and provides a systematic framework for
analyzing model-specific generation behaviors. We publicly release the dataset
and code to foster research at the intersection of generative language modeling
and systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective
planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool
calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge.
To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn
conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool
dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents'
ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain
and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both
short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as
deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating
research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating
the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by
T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex,

Motivation: 现有研究多关注用形式语言引导LLMs推理，但对其能力的系统评估有限，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 从LLM谱系、任务分类和轨迹格式三个维度，利用形式语言对LLMs进行综合评估，并通过微调方法提升小模型性能。

Result: 思考模型表现更优，但所有模型在归纳推理中表现不佳；PoT格式数据泛化能力最强；简单微调方法显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 形式语言对LLMs的逻辑推理能力有显著影响，未来研究可进一步优化模型在归纳推理中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve breakthrough
performance on complex logical reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, most existing
research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable
reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still
limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs
across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages. From the
perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and
format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly
outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All
LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of
whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best
generalization performance across other languages. Additionally, we also curate
the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models,
and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method
can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the
best overall performance. Our codes and reports are available at

Motivation: 解决现有RAG方法成本高、泛化差或忽略模型内部知识的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：SFT冷启动学习初步格式，RL动态知识获取阶段通过结果监督、奖励机制和记忆机制优化内外知识利用。

Result: 实验表明R1-Searcher++优于现有RAG和推理方法，实现高效检索。

Conclusion: R1-Searcher++通过结合内外知识，显著提升LLMs的检索增强推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to
static knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting
external information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly,
or ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce
R1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage
both internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage
training strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format
learning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses
outcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism
for internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to
continuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's
internal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search
engine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++
outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient
retrieval. The code is available at

Method: 使用FinBERT处理GDELT新闻数据，构建情绪指数（均值、离散度和事件影响），并用XGBoost和逻辑回归预测收益。

Result: XGBoost策略在OOS测试中表现卓越，Sharpe比率和CAGR显著高于基准。SHAP分析显示情绪离散度和事件影响是关键特征。

Conclusion: 结合领域特定NLP和可解释ML，为宏观经济alpha提供了一种强大且可解释的方法。

Abstract: This study introduces an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to
extract macroeconomic alpha from global news sentiment. We process the Global
Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Project's worldwide news feed
using FinBERT -- a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) based model pretrained on finance-specific language -- to construct
daily sentiment indices incorporating mean tone, dispersion, and event impact.
These indices drive an XGBoost classifier, benchmarked against logistic
regression, to predict next-day returns for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and 10-year U.S.
Treasury futures (ZN). Rigorous out-of-sample (OOS) backtesting (5-fold
expanding-window cross-validation, OOS period: c. 2017-April 2025) demonstrates
exceptional, cost-adjusted performance for the XGBoost strategy: Sharpe ratios
achieve 5.87 (EUR/USD), 4.65 (USD/JPY), and 4.65 (Treasuries), with respective
compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) exceeding 50% in Foreign Exchange (FX) and
22% in bonds. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) affirm that sentiment
dispersion and article impact are key predictive features. Our findings
establish that integrating domain-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP)
with interpretable ML offers a potent and explainable source of macro alpha.

Method: 将模型压缩问题重新建模为QUBO问题，并利用商业量子退火设备评估解空间。

Result: 实验表明，AQC在时间效率上优于经典算法（如遗传算法和强化学习），并能更有效地找到全局最优解。

Conclusion: AQC在DNN模型压缩中表现出色，为量子优化在深度学习中的应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Quantum optimization is the most mature quantum computing technology to date,
providing a promising approach towards efficiently solving complex
combinatorial problems. Methods such as adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) have
been employed in recent years on important optimization problems across various
domains. In deep learning, deep neural networks (DNN) have reached immense
sizes to support new predictive capabilities. Optimization of large-scale
models is critical for sustainable deployment, but becomes increasingly
challenging with ever-growing model sizes and complexity. While quantum
optimization is suitable for solving complex problems, its application to DNN
optimization is not straightforward, requiring thorough reformulation for
compatibility with commercially available quantum devices. In this work, we
explore the potential of adopting AQC for fine-grained pruning-quantization of
convolutional neural networks. We rework established heuristics to formulate
model compression as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
problem, and assess the solution space offered by commercial quantum annealing
devices. Through our exploratory efforts of reformulation, we demonstrate that
AQC can achieve effective compression of practical DNN models. Experiments
demonstrate that adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) not only outperforms
classical algorithms like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning in
terms of time efficiency but also excels at identifying global optima.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models, like their classical counterparts, are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, hindering their secure deployment. Here, we
report the first systematic experimental robustness benchmark for 20-qubit
quantum neural network (QNN) classifiers executed on a superconducting
processor. Our benchmarking framework features an efficient adversarial attack
algorithm designed for QNNs, enabling quantitative characterization of
adversarial robustness and robustness bounds. From our analysis, we verify that
adversarial training reduces sensitivity to targeted perturbations by
regularizing input gradients, significantly enhancing QNN's robustness.
Additionally, our analysis reveals that QNNs exhibit superior adversarial
robustness compared to classical neural networks, an advantage attributed to
inherent quantum noise. Furthermore, the empirical upper bound extracted from
our attack experiments shows a minimal deviation ($3 \times 10^{-3}$) from the
theoretical lower bound, providing strong experimental confirmation of the
attack's effectiveness and the tightness of fidelity-based robustness bounds.
This work establishes a critical experimental framework for assessing and
improving quantum adversarial robustness, paving the way for secure and
reliable QML applications.

Abstract: Foundation models leveraging vision-language pretraining have shown promise
in chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, yet their real-world performance across
diverse populations and diagnostic tasks remains insufficiently evaluated. This
study benchmarks the diagnostic performance and generalizability of foundation
models versus traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on multinational
CXR datasets. We evaluated eight CXR diagnostic models - five vision-language
foundation models and three CNN-based architectures - across 37 standardized
classification tasks using six public datasets from the USA, Spain, India, and
Vietnam, and three private datasets from hospitals in China. Performance was
assessed using AUROC, AUPRC, and other metrics across both shared and
dataset-specific tasks. Foundation models outperformed CNNs in both accuracy
and task coverage. MAVL, a model incorporating knowledge-enhanced prompts and
structured supervision, achieved the highest performance on public (mean AUROC:
0.82; AUPRC: 0.32) and private (mean AUROC: 0.95; AUPRC: 0.89) datasets,
ranking first in 14 of 37 public and 3 of 4 private tasks. All models showed
reduced performance on pediatric cases, with average AUROC dropping from 0.88
+/- 0.18 in adults to 0.57 +/- 0.29 in children (p = 0.0202). These findings

TL;DR: 该研究通过扩散概率生成模型加速新生儿重症监护病房（NICU）中的MRI扫描，提出了一种处理低信噪比和有限数据集的训练流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICU中的永久磁体MRI扫描时间长，信噪比低，接收线圈有限，需要一种方法来加速扫描并提高图像质量。

Method: 研究提出了一种训练流程，包括修改网络架构支持不同分辨率、使用学习类嵌入向量训练单一模型、自监督去噪预处理以及通过后验样本平均重建图像。

Result: 结合所有数据、去噪预训练和后验样本平均，重建质量得到量化提升。生成模型在两种加速率下无需重新训练即可工作，临床研究表明1.5倍欠采样重建图像适用于临床。

Conclusion: 扩散概率生成模型结合提出的流程可减少NICU中新生儿MRI的扫描时间。

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive assessment of
brain abnormalities during early life development. Permanent magnet scanners
operating in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) facilitate MRI of sick
infants, but have long scan times due to lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and
limited receive coils. This work accelerates in-NICU MRI with diffusion
probabilistic generative models by developing a training pipeline accounting
for these challenges.
  Methods: We establish a novel training dataset of clinical, 1 Tesla neonatal
MR images in collaboration with Aspect Imaging and Sha'are Zedek Medical
Center. We propose a pipeline to handle the low quantity and SNR of our
real-world dataset (1) modifying existing network architectures to support
varying resolutions; (2) training a single model on all data with learned class
embedding vectors; (3) applying self-supervised denoising before training; and
(4) reconstructing by averaging posterior samples. Retrospective under-sampling
experiments, accounting for signal decay, evaluated each item of our proposed
methodology. A clinical reader study with practicing pediatric
neuroradiologists evaluated our proposed images reconstructed from 1.5x
under-sampled data.
  Results: Combining all data, denoising pre-training, and averaging posterior
samples yields quantitative improvements in reconstruction. The generative
model decouples the learned prior from the measurement model and functions at
two acceleration rates without re-training. The reader study suggests that
proposed images reconstructed from approximately 1.5x under-sampled data are
adequate for clinical use.
  Conclusion: Diffusion probabilistic generative models applied with the
proposed pipeline to handle challenging real-world datasets could reduce scan
time of in-NICU neonatal MRI.

Motivation: 现有扰动技术缺乏深入理解，不当扰动可能带来负面影响，需解决如何利用扰动机制引导未标记数据学习及确保边界区域预测准确性。

Method: 提出P3M机制动态调整扰动，结合边界聚焦损失增强模型对边界细节的敏感性。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上取得最优性能，P3M可扩展至其他方法，边界损失通用性强。

Conclusion: P3M和边界损失提升了SSMIS性能，具有扩展性和适用性。

Abstract: Perturbation with diverse unlabeled data has proven beneficial for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS). While many works have
successfully used various perturbation techniques, a deeper understanding of
learning perturbations is needed. Excessive or inappropriate perturbation can
have negative effects, so we aim to address two challenges: how to use
perturbation mechanisms to guide the learning of unlabeled data through labeled
data, and how to ensure accurate predictions in boundary regions. Inspired by
human progressive and periodic learning, we propose a progressive and periodic
perturbation mechanism (P3M) and a boundary-focused loss. P3M enables dynamic
adjustment of perturbations, allowing the model to gradually learn them. Our
boundary-focused loss encourages the model to concentrate on boundary regions,
enhancing sensitivity to intricate details and ensuring accurate predictions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two 2D and 3D datasets. Moreover, P3M is extendable to other
methods, and the proposed loss serves as a universal tool for improving
existing methods, highlighting the scalability and applicability of our
approach.

lung opacity, and normal lung conditions from chest X-ray images. A range of
models, including CNN, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, ResNet50V2,
InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121, were applied to both
individual and hybrid datasets. The results showed superior performance on the
hybrid dataset, with VGG16, Xception, ResNet50V2, and DenseNet121 each
achieving an accuracy of 99%. This consistent performance across the hybrid
dataset highlights the robustness of these models in handling diverse data
while maintaining high accuracy. To understand the models implicit behavior,
explainable AI techniques were employed to illuminate their black-box nature.
Specifically, LIME was used to enhance the interpretability of model
predictions, especially in cases of misclassification, contributing to the
development of reliable and interpretable AI-driven solutions for medical

*Jinpei Guo,Yifei Ji,Zheng Chen,Kai Liu,Min Liu,Wang Rao,Wenbo Li,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: OSCAR是一种基于预训练潜在扩散模型的一步扩散编解码器，支持多比特率图像压缩，显著提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法通过多步采样重建图像，计算开销大且需为不同比特率训练单独模型，导致训练和存储成本高。

Method: 将压缩潜在表示视为原始潜在表示的噪声变体，建立比特率与伪扩散时间步的映射，用单生成模型支持多比特率重建。

Result: OSCAR在定量和视觉质量指标上表现优异，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: OSCAR通过一步去噪实现高效多比特率图像压缩，性能优越。

Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy
image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing
diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random
noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have
achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs
substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training
separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant
training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step
diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our
method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents,
where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows
them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By
establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion
timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at
multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich
structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR
replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly
improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR
achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.
The code and models will be released at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交互式语义的人体视频压缩方法，通过嵌入可配置的语义表示实现交互和可控的视频编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频编码在超低码率下性能有限，且缺乏交互性。本文旨在通过语义级表示实现高效压缩和交互控制。

Method: 使用3D人体模型将复杂的人体信号动态分解为可配置的嵌入表示，支持可控编辑和高效传输。解码器通过语义重建高质量人体视频。

Result: 在超低码率下，性能优于VVC标准和生成式压缩方案，且无需额外预处理即可实现交互式编码。

Conclusion: 该方法为元宇宙中数字人通信提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to compress human body video with interactive
semantics, which can facilitate video coding to be interactive and controllable
by manipulating semantic-level representations embedded in the coded bitstream.
In particular, the proposed encoder employs a 3D human model to disentangle
nonlinear dynamics and complex motion of human body signal into a series of
configurable embeddings, which are controllably edited, compactly compressed,
and efficiently transmitted. Moreover, the proposed decoder can evolve the
mesh-based motion fields from these decoded semantics to realize the
high-quality human body video reconstruction. Experimental results illustrate
that the proposed framework can achieve promising compression performance for
human body videos at ultra-low bitrate ranges compared with the
state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and the
latest generative compression schemes. Furthermore, the proposed framework
enables interactive human body video coding without any additional
pre-/post-manipulation processes, which is expected to shed light on
metaverse-related digital human communication in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于像素空间的变换编码方法因与人类感知不匹配，难以在超低比特率下同时实现高真实感与高保真度。

Method: GLC在生成向量量化变分自编码器（VQ-VAE）的潜在空间中进行变换编码，并引入空间分类超模块和时空分类超模块优化性能。

Result: GLC-image在CLIC 2020测试集上比特率低于0.04 bpp，比特率节省45%；GLC-video在DISTS指标上比特率节省65.3%。

Conclusion: GLC方法在超低比特率下显著提升了图像和视频压缩的视觉质量。

Abstract: Most existing approaches for image and video compression perform transform
coding in the pixel space to reduce redundancy. However, due to the
misalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such
schemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and
high-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{L}atent \textbf{C}oding (\textbf{GLC}) models for
image and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform
coding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized
variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent
space offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human
perception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity
compression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by
introducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a
spatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the
code-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality
at ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression. For image
compression, GLC-image achieves an impressive bitrate of less than $0.04$ bpp,
achieving the same FID as previous SOTA model MS-ILLM while using $45\%$ fewer
bitrate on the CLIC 2020 test set. For video compression, GLC-video achieves
65.3\% bitrate saving over PLVC in terms of DISTS.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的跨模态状态空间模型网络（PCMamba），用于双相机压缩高光谱成像（DCCHI），通过结合物理成像过程和线性复杂度的Mamba模型，实现轻量级且高质量的高光谱重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要显式地从2D压缩测量和PAN图像中提取光谱和空间信息，导致高光谱重建存在瓶颈。物理因素（如温度、发射率和物体间的多次反射）在高光谱热信号获取中起关键作用，因此研究物理属性间的相互关系以提供更深层次的理论见解。

Method: 提出PCMamba模型，将高光谱物理成像过程融入线性复杂度的Mamba模型，设计跨模态扫描Mamba块（CSMB）实现模态间像素级交互，并通过物理驱动合成过程重建高光谱图像。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: PCMamba通过结合物理建模和跨模态交互，实现了高效且高质量的高光谱重建，为相关领域提供了新的理论和技术支持。

Abstract: Panchromatic (PAN) -assisted Dual-Camera Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging
(DCCHI) is a key technology in snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Existing
research primarily focuses on exploring spectral information from 2D
compressive measurements and spatial information from PAN images in an explicit
manner, leading to a bottleneck in HSI reconstruction. Various physical
factors, such as temperature, emissivity, and multiple reflections between
objects, play a critical role in the process of a sensor acquiring
hyperspectral thermal signals. Inspired by this, we attempt to investigate the
interrelationships between physical properties to provide deeper theoretical
insights for HSI reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a Physics-Informed
Cross-Modal State Space Model Network (PCMamba) for DCCHI, which incorporates
the forward physical imaging process of HSI into the linear complexity of Mamba
to facilitate lightweight and high-quality HSI reconstruction. Specifically, we
analyze the imaging process of hyperspectral thermal signals to enable the
network to disentangle the three key physical properties-temperature,
emissivity, and texture. By fully exploiting the potential information embedded
in 2D measurements and PAN images, the HSIs are reconstructed through a
physics-driven synthesis process. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Scanning
Mamba Block (CSMB) that introduces inter-modal pixel-wise interaction with
positional inductive bias by cross-scanning the backbone features and PAN
features. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Conclusion: 论文提出了平台级比较和设计见解，强调需要高效、自适应的LM推理系统，而非一刀切的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Language Models (LMs) across industries is driving
interest in deploying these services across the computing continuum, from the
cloud to the network edge. This shift aims to reduce costs, lower latency, and
improve reliability and privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs), enabled by
advances in model compression, are central to this shift, offering a path to
on-device inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. This work examines
the interplay between edge and cloud deployments, starting from detailed
benchmarking of SLM capabilities on single edge devices, and extending to
distributed edge clusters. We identify scenarios where edge inference offers
comparable performance with lower costs, and others where cloud fallback
becomes essential due to limits in scalability or model capacity. Rather than
proposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we present platform-level comparisons
and design insights for building efficient, adaptive LM inference systems
across heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: 研究为离线重激活现象提供了理论支持，表明其是噪声神经电路中任务优化的自然结果。

Abstract: During periods of quiescence, such as sleep, neural activity in many brain
circuits resembles that observed during periods of task engagement. However,
the precise conditions under which task-optimized networks can autonomously
reactivate the same network states responsible for online behavior is poorly
understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework that outlines
sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that
encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We demonstrate mathematically that
noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using
change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which,
in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations
observed during periods of online activity. We validate our findings using
numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position
estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation based on
angular velocity cues. Overall, our work provides theoretical support for
modeling offline reactivation as an emergent consequence of task optimization
in noisy neural circuits.

Abstract: Effective disaster management requires timely access to accurate and

user queries and more than 1.3 million labeled query-passage pairs, covering 48
distinct retrieval tasks derived from six search intents and eight general
disaster categories that include 301 specific event types. Our evaluations of
30 state-of-the-art retrieval models demonstrate significant performance
variances across tasks, with no single model excelling universally.
Furthermore, comparative analyses reveal significant performance gaps between
general-domain and disaster management-specific tasks, highlighting the
necessity of disaster management-specific benchmarks for guiding IR model

Abstract: The exponential growth of data-driven systems and AI technologies has
intensified the demand for high-quality web-sourced datasets. While existing
datasets have proven valuable, conventional web data collection approaches face
significant limitations in terms of human effort and scalability. Current
data-collecting solutions fall into two categories: wrapper-based methods that
struggle with adaptability and reproducibility, and large language model
(LLM)-based approaches that incur substantial computational and financial
costs. To address these challenges, we propose AutoData, a novel multi-agent
system for Automated web Data collection, that requires minimal human
intervention, i.e., only necessitating a natural language instruction
specifying the desired dataset. In addition, AutoData is designed with a robust
multi-agent architecture, featuring a novel oriented message hypergraph
coordinated by a central task manager, to efficiently organize agents across
research and development squads. Besides, we introduce a novel hypergraph cache
system to advance the multi-agent collaboration process that enables efficient
automated data collection and mitigates the token cost issues prevalent in
existing LLM-based systems. Moreover, we introduce Instruct2DS, a new benchmark
dataset supporting live data collection from web sources across three domains:
academic, finance, and sports. Comprehensive evaluations over Instruct2DS and
three existing benchmark datasets demonstrate AutoData's superior performance
compared to baseline methods. Case studies on challenging tasks such as picture
book collection and paper extraction from surveys further validate its
applicability. Our source code and dataset are available at

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，Conf-GNNRec在预测置信度和推荐性能上均有效。

Conclusion: Conf-GNNRec能有效解决噪声和过自信问题，提升推荐系统的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems based on graph neural networks perform well in tasks such
as rating and ranking. However, in real-world recommendation scenarios, noise
such as user misuse and malicious advertisement gradually accumulates through
the message propagation mechanism. Even if existing studies mitigate their
effects by reducing the noise propagation weights, the severe sparsity of the
recommender system still leads to the low-weighted noisy neighbors being
mistaken as meaningful information, and the prediction result obtained based on
the polluted nodes is not entirely trustworthy. Therefore, it is crucial to
measure the confidence of the prediction results in this highly noisy
framework. Furthermore, our evaluation of the existing representative GNN-based
recommendation shows that it suffers from overconfidence. Based on the above
considerations, we propose a new method to quantify and calibrate the
prediction confidence of GNN-based recommendations (Conf-GNNRec). Specifically,
we propose a rating calibration method that dynamically adjusts excessive
ratings to mitigate overconfidence based on user personalization. We also
design a confidence loss function to reduce the overconfidence of negative
samples and effectively improve recommendation performance. Experiments on
public datasets demonstrate the validity of Conf-GNNRec in prediction
confidence and recommendation performance.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) faces dual challenges in
processing lengthy multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and performing
cross-modal reasoning. Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG)
methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing
critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for
assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG,
a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with
multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative
metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that
interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments
with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent
challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key
findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than
open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal
inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant
performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial
improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a
rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more
robust multimodal DocVQA systems. Our benchmark and code are available at

Conclusion: DFGR是一种高效且有效的新一代生成排序范式。

Abstract: We introduce the Dual-Flow Generative Ranking Network (DFGR), a two-stream
architecture designed for recommendation systems. DFGR integrates innovative
interaction patterns between real and fake flows within the QKV modules of the
self-attention mechanism, enhancing both training and inference efficiency.
This approach effectively addresses a key limitation observed in Meta's
proposed HSTU generative recommendation approach, where heterogeneous
information volumes are mapped into identical vector spaces, leading to
training instability. Unlike traditional recommendation models, DFGR only
relies on user history behavior sequences and minimal attribute information,
eliminating the need for extensive manual feature engineering. Comprehensive
evaluations on open-source and industrial datasets reveal DFGR's superior
performance compared to established baselines such as DIN, DCN, DIEN, and
DeepFM. We also investigate optimal parameter allocation strategies under
computational constraints, establishing DFGR as an efficient and effective
next-generation generate ranking paradigm.

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于推理的段落重排器（ReasonRR）在相同训练条件下通常表现不如非推理的标准重排器（StandardRR），且禁用推理功能后（ReasonRR-NoReason）效果反而更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理能力是否真的能提升基于大语言模型（LLM）的段落重排器的准确性。

Method: 比较推理型重排器（ReasonRR）与非推理型重排器（StandardRR）的表现，并进一步分析推理对ReasonRR的影响。

Result: StandardRR通常优于ReasonRR，而禁用推理的ReasonRR-NoReason表现更好，原因是推理过程导致LLM倾向于极化的相关性评分。

Conclusion: 推理过程限制了重排器的表现，因为它忽略了段落的部分相关性，这是点式重排器准确性的关键因素。

Abstract: With the growing success of reasoning models across complex natural language
tasks, researchers in the Information Retrieval (IR) community have begun
exploring how similar reasoning capabilities can be integrated into passage
rerankers built on Large Language Models (LLMs). These methods typically employ
an LLM to produce an explicit, step-by-step reasoning process before arriving
at a final relevance prediction. But, does reasoning actually improve reranking
accuracy? In this paper, we dive deeper into this question, studying the impact
of the reasoning process by comparing reasoning-based pointwise rerankers
(ReasonRR) to standard, non-reasoning pointwise rerankers (StandardRR) under
identical training conditions, and observe that StandardRR generally
outperforms ReasonRR. Building on this observation, we then study the
importance of reasoning to ReasonRR by disabling its reasoning process
(ReasonRR-NoReason), and find that ReasonRR-NoReason is surprisingly more
effective than ReasonRR. Examining the cause of this result, our findings
reveal that reasoning-based rerankers are limited by the LLM's reasoning
process, which pushes it toward polarized relevance scores and thus fails to
consider the partial relevance of passages, a key factor for the accuracy of
pointwise rerankers.

TL;DR: 研究发现某些训练数据集可能降低模型效果，提出通过LLM提示重新标记假阴性样本，显著提升检索和重排序模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 某些数据集可能对模型效果产生负面影响，尤其是假阴性样本问题，需改进训练数据质量。

Method: 采用级联LLM提示方法识别并重新标记假阴性样本。

Result: 重新标记后，E5和Qwen2.5-7B检索模型在BEIR和AIR-Bench上性能提升0.7-1.8 nDCG@10，重排序模型也有类似提升。

Conclusion: 级联LLM提示方法能有效提升训练数据质量，显著改进模型性能，且GPT-4o在人工标注中表现更可靠。

Abstract: Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale
retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million
query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that
certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of
15 datasets from the BGE collection reduces the training set size by
2.35$\times$ and increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a
deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false
negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We
propose a simple, cost-effective approach using cascading LLM prompts to
identify and relabel hard negatives. Experimental results show that relabeling
false negatives with true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B
retrieval models by 0.7-1.4 nDCG@10 on BEIR and by 1.7-1.8 nDCG@10 on zero-shot
AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on
the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of the
cascading design is further supported by human annotation results, where we
find judgment by GPT-4o shows much higher agreement with humans than
GPT-4o-mini.

Motivation: 现有研究将LLMs作为外部推理模块，导致资源成本高且联合优化不足，因此需要一种统一的模型来解决这些问题。

Method: 重新设计模型架构以实现自回归过程中的推理与推荐交替，并提出RecPO强化学习框架，通过融合奖励方案优化推理和推荐能力。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验显示，\name在Hit@5和NDCG@20指标上分别相对提升了68.67%和45.21%。

Conclusion: \name通过统一架构和RecPO框架，显著提升了推荐系统的性能和效率，同时减少了对专业推理标注的依赖。

Abstract: Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via
encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning
synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. Current
studies usually position LLMs as external reasoning modules to yield auxiliary
thought for augmenting conventional recommendation pipelines. However, such
decoupled designs are limited in significant resource cost and suboptimal joint
optimization. To address these issues, we propose \name, a unified large
recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capabilities. Initially, we
reconceptualize the model architecture to facilitate interleaved reasoning and
recommendation in the autoregressive process. Subsequently, we propose RecPO, a
corresponding reinforcement learning framework that optimizes \name\ both the
reasoning and recommendation capabilities simultaneously in a single policy
update; RecPO introduces a fused reward scheme that solely leverages
recommendation labels to simulate the reasoning capability, eliminating
dependency on specialized reasoning annotations. Experiments on three datasets
with various baselines verify the effectiveness of \name, showing relative
improvements of 68.67\% in Hit@5 and 45.21\% in NDCG@20. Code available at

Abstract: We present a novel implicit neural shape optimization framework for 3D
high-contrast Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), addressing scenarios where
conductivity exhibits sharp discontinuities across material interfaces. These
high-contrast cases, prevalent in metallic implant monitoring and industrial

optimization scheme that explicitly incorporates high-contrast interface
conditions and an efficient latent space representation that reduces variable
dimensionality. Through rigorous theoretical analysis of algorithm convergence
and extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate substantial performance
improvements, establishing our framework as promising for practical

Conclusion: 网络稀疏度对维持网络活动和动态至关重要，稀疏网络更适合用于动态储层计算。

Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) with physical systems requires an understanding of
the underlying structure and internal dynamics of the specific physical
reservoir. In this study, physical nano-electronic networks with neuromorphic
dynamics are investigated for their use as physical reservoirs in an RC
framework. These neuromorphic networks operate as dynamic reservoirs, with node
activities in general coupled to the edge dynamics through nonlinear
nano-electronic circuit elements, and the reservoir outputs influenced by the
underlying network connectivity structure. This study finds that networks with
varying degrees of sparsity generate more useful nonlinear temporal outputs for
dynamic RC compared to dense networks. Dynamic RC is also tested on an
autonomous multivariate chaotic time series prediction task with networks of
varying densities, which revealed the importance of network sparsity in
maintaining network activity and overall dynamics, that in turn enabled the
learning of the chaotic Lorenz63 system's attractor behavior.

Result: 模型比传统数值求解器快89倍，并验证了网络架构中关键组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法在地幔对流模拟中展现出高效性，但在未见场景中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Mantle convection simulations are an essential tool for understanding how
rocky planets evolve. However, the poorly known input parameters to these
simulations, the non-linear dependence of transport properties on pressure and
temperature, and the long integration times in excess of several billion years
all pose a computational challenge for numerical solvers. We propose a
physics-based machine learning approach that predicts creeping flow velocities
as a function of temperature while conserving mass, thereby bypassing the
numerical solution of the Stokes problem. A finite-volume solver then uses the
predicted velocities to advect and diffuse the temperature field to the next
time-step, enabling autoregressive rollout at inference. For training, our
model requires temperature-velocity snapshots from a handful of simulations
(94). We consider mantle convection in a two-dimensional rectangular box with
basal and internal heating, pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity.
Overall, our model is up to 89 times faster than the numerical solver. We also
show the importance of different components in our convolutional neural network
architecture such as mass conservation, learned paddings on the boundaries, and
loss scaling for the overall rollout performance. Finally, we test our approach
on unseen scenarios to demonstrate some of its strengths and weaknesses.

Result: 计算线性区域数量为NP和#P难问题，但对某些定义可在多项式空间内完成。

Conclusion: 线性区域的计算复杂度高，但对某些定义存在可行的算法。

Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network
is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There
exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region
actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and
discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational
complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions.
Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and
#P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong
hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on
the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least
be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.

Result: AutoMCQ能高效生成代码理解问题，帮助评估学生理解能力并检测抄袭。

Conclusion: AutoMCQ为代码理解评估提供了一种可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This
sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can
mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In
addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a
world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code
comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to
gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect
plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult
and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for
the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This
is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.

Conclusion: 开源LLM通过CGMs方法能够有效处理仓库级任务，无需依赖代理，且在性能上显著优于现有开源方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks
remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM
agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising
concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates
whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without
requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling
LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic
information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph
Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's
attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a
specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our
approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark
using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among
open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth
overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.

Result: 潜在空间能有效区分Gaia DR3中的主要变源类别，并揭示了与天体物理性质强相关的密集区域。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了多数据产品结合的强大协同效应，为变源分类、聚类和异常检测提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry,
BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results
for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique
opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data
products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning
methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an
unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4
million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE),
which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and
generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a
novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G
band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is
compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional
latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The
learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes
between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated
through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent
space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and
low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the
different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent
variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with
astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for
astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent
representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks,
including classification, clustering and outlier detection.

Motivation: 车联网的动态性和无线数据传输特性使其易受网络威胁，现有集中式IDS依赖云端导致延迟，而边缘节点资源不足。

Result: 使用CIC-IoV2024数据集验证，模型在保护车联网安全方面表现出可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 分层分类框架为车联网提供了高效且分布式的安全解决方案。

Abstract: Due to its nature of dynamic, mobility, and wireless data transfer, the
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is prone to various cyber threats, ranging from
spoofing and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks to malware. To
safeguard the IoV ecosystem from intrusions, malicious activities, policy
violations, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a critical role by
continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic to identify and mitigate
potential threats in real-time. However, most existing research has focused on
developing centralized, machine learning-based IDS systems for IoV without
accounting for its inherently distributed nature. Due to intensive computing
requirements, these centralized systems often rely on the cloud to detect cyber
threats, increasing delay of system response. On the other hand, edge nodes
typically lack the necessary resources to train and deploy complex machine
learning algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes an effective
hierarchical classification framework tailored for IoV networks. Hierarchical
classification allows classifiers to be trained and tested at different levels,
enabling edge nodes to detect specific types of attacks independently. With
this approach, edge nodes can conduct targeted attack detection while
leveraging cloud nodes for comprehensive threat analysis and support. Given the
resource constraints of edge nodes, we have employed the Boruta feature
selection method to reduce data dimensionality, optimizing processing
efficiency. To evaluate our proposed framework, we utilize the latest IoV
security dataset CIC-IoV2024, achieving promising results that demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of our models in securing IoV networks.

Motivation: 保护大型语言模型（LLM）的知识产权（IP）免受恶意窃取或未经授权的部署，现有方法存在局限性。

Method: 提出DuFFin框架，结合触发模式和知识级指纹进行黑盒验证。

Result: 实验表明，DuFFin能准确验证基础LLM的版权，IP-ROC指标超过0.95。

Conclusion: DuFFin是一种有效的黑盒LLM知识产权保护方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are considered valuable Intellectual Properties
(IP) for legitimate owners due to the enormous computational cost of training.
It is crucial to protect the IP of LLMs from malicious stealing or unauthorized
deployment. Despite existing efforts in watermarking and fingerprinting LLMs,
these methods either impact the text generation process or are limited in
white-box access to the suspect model, making them impractical. Hence, we
propose DuFFin, a novel $\textbf{Du}$al-Level $\textbf{Fin}$gerprinting
$\textbf{F}$ramework for black-box setting ownership verification. DuFFin
extracts the trigger pattern and the knowledge-level fingerprints to identify
the source of a suspect model. We conduct experiments on a variety of models
collected from the open-source website, including four popular base models as
protected LLMs and their fine-tuning, quantization, and safety alignment
versions, which are released by large companies, start-ups, and individual
users. Results show that our method can accurately verify the copyright of the
base protected LLM on their model variants, achieving the IP-ROC metric greater
than 0.95. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BadVLA是一种针对视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的后门攻击方法，首次揭示了此类模型的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人控制中表现出色，但其紧密耦合的架构带来了新的安全威胁，尤其是后门攻击。目前这一领域的研究尚不充分。

Method: BadVLA采用目标解耦优化的两阶段方法：1）特征空间分离以隔离触发器；2）条件控制偏差，仅在触发器存在时激活。

Result: 在多个VLA基准测试中，BadVLA攻击成功率接近100%，且对正常任务性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 研究首次系统性地揭示了VLA模型的后门漏洞，强调了安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic control by enabling
end-to-end decision-making directly from multimodal inputs. However, their
tightly coupled architectures expose novel security vulnerabilities. Unlike
traditional adversarial perturbations, backdoor attacks represent a stealthier,
persistent, and practically significant threat-particularly under the emerging
Training-as-a-Service paradigm-but remain largely unexplored in the context of
VLA models. To address this gap, we propose BadVLA, a backdoor attack method
based on Objective-Decoupled Optimization, which for the first time exposes the
backdoor vulnerabilities of VLA models. Specifically, it consists of a
two-stage process: (1) explicit feature-space separation to isolate trigger
representations from benign inputs, and (2) conditional control deviations that
activate only in the presence of the trigger, while preserving clean-task
performance. Empirical results on multiple VLA benchmarks demonstrate that
BadVLA consistently achieves near-100% attack success rates with minimal impact
on clean task accuracy. Further analyses confirm its robustness against common
input perturbations, task transfers, and model fine-tuning, underscoring
critical security vulnerabilities in current VLA deployments. Our work offers
the first systematic investigation of backdoor vulnerabilities in VLA models,
highlighting an urgent need for secure and trustworthy embodied model design
practices. We have released the project page at

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在微调即服务（FTaaS）中面临后门攻击风险，恶意微调可轻易植入后门。

Method: BYE通过三阶段流程（提取注意力图、计算熵值、无监督聚类）识别并过滤后门样本。

Result: BYE在多种数据集和触发类型下表现优异，攻击成功率接近零且不影响正常任务性能。

Conclusion: BYE为MLLMs提供了一种无需额外监督或模型修改的通用后门防御方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
fine-tuning-as-a-service (FTaaS) settings, where user-submitted datasets adapt
general-purpose models to downstream tasks. This flexibility, however,
introduces serious security risks, as malicious fine-tuning can implant
backdoors into MLLMs with minimal effort. In this paper, we observe that
backdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing
abnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term
attention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE),
a data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as
self-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples. BYE operates
via a three-stage pipeline: (1) extracting attention maps using the fine-tuned
model, (2) computing entropy scores and profiling sensitive layers via bimodal
separation, and (3) performing unsupervised clustering to remove suspicious
samples. Unlike prior defenses, BYE equires no clean supervision, auxiliary
labels, or model modifications. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and diverse trigger types validate BYE's effectiveness: it achieves
near-zero attack success rates while maintaining clean-task performance,
offering a robust and generalizable solution against backdoor threats in MLLMs.

### [487] [BitHydra: Towards Bit-flip Inference Cost Attack against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16670)
*Xiaobei Yan,Yiming Li,Zhaoxin Fan,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的推理成本攻击（'bit-flip inference cost attack'），通过翻转模型参数的关键位来攻击受害者模型本身，而非其输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理成本攻击效果有限，因为它们仅通过输入攻击，而攻击者同时也是用户，无法产生大规模恶意影响。

Method: 设计了一种名为'BitHydra'的方法，通过抑制<EOS>标记概率的损失函数和高效的关键位搜索算法，翻转模型参数的关键位。

Result: 在11个LLM上评估，仅需4个搜索样本和3位翻转，即可使100%的测试提示达到最大生成长度。

Conclusion: BitHydra展示了高效性、可扩展性和强迁移能力，能够有效攻击LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide
range of applications, but their ever-increasing size and resource demands make
them vulnerable to inference cost attacks, where attackers induce victim LLMs
to generate the longest possible output content. In this paper, we revisit
existing inference cost attacks and reveal that these methods can hardly
produce large-scale malicious effects since they are self-targeting, where
attackers are also the users and therefore have to execute attacks solely
through the inputs, whose generated content will be charged by LLMs and can
only directly influence themselves. Motivated by these findings, this paper
introduces a new type of inference cost attacks (dubbed 'bit-flip inference
cost attack') that target the victim model itself rather than its inputs.
Specifically, we design a simple yet effective method (dubbed 'BitHydra') to
effectively flip critical bits of model parameters. This process is guided by a
loss function designed to suppress <EOS> token's probability with an efficient
critical bit search algorithm, thus explicitly defining the attack objective
and enabling effective optimization. We evaluate our method on 11 LLMs ranging
from 1.5B to 14B parameters under both int8 and float16 settings. Experimental
results demonstrate that with just 4 search samples and as few as 3 bit flips,
BitHydra can force 100% of test prompts to reach the maximum generation length
(e.g., 2048 tokens) on representative LLMs such as LLaMA3, highlighting its
efficiency, scalability, and strong transferability across unseen inputs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对开源语言模型的领域特定水印技术，用于解决模型溯源问题，确保检测可靠性并保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源语言模型能力的提升和广泛使用，模型溯源问题日益重要，现有水印技术难以满足实际所有权检测需求。

Method: 提出领域特定水印技术，仅在特定子领域（如语言或主题）嵌入水印，以提高检测可靠性和水印耐久性。

Result: 评估表明，该方法具有强统计保证、可控误报率、高检测能力，并保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 领域特定水印技术有效解决了模型溯源问题，具有隐蔽性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As open-source language models (OSMs) grow more capable and are widely shared
and finetuned, ensuring model provenance, i.e., identifying the origin of a
given model instance, has become an increasingly important issue. At the same
time, existing backdoor-based model fingerprinting techniques often fall short
of achieving key requirements of real-world model ownership detection. In this
work, we build on the observation that while current open-source model
watermarks fail to achieve reliable content traceability, they can be
effectively adapted to address the challenge of model provenance. To this end,
we introduce the concept of domain-specific watermarking for model
fingerprinting. Rather than watermarking all generated content, we train the
model to embed watermarks only within specified subdomains (e.g., particular
languages or topics). This targeted approach ensures detection reliability,
while improving watermark durability and quality under a range of real-world
deployment settings. Our evaluations show that domain-specific watermarking
enables model fingerprinting with strong statistical guarantees, controllable
false positive rates, high detection power, and preserved generation quality.
Moreover, we find that our fingerprints are inherently stealthy and naturally
robust to real-world variability across deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为StegoAttack的新型越狱攻击方法，通过隐写术隐藏恶意查询，同时保持文本自然性，显著提高了攻击成功率和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究越狱攻击对大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性至关重要，现有方法难以同时实现毒性隐蔽和语言自然性。

Method: 提出StegoAttack，利用隐写术将有害查询隐藏在语义连贯的良性文本中，并让LLM提取隐藏查询并以加密方式响应。

Result: 在四种主流LLM上评估，StegoAttack的平均攻击成功率达92.00%，优于基线方法11.0%，且隐蔽性表现最优。

Conclusion: StegoAttack展示了高效且隐蔽的越狱攻击能力，为LLM安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to large language models (LLMs) by
bypassing built-in safety mechanisms and leading to harmful outputs. Studying
these attacks is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and improving model
security. This paper presents a systematic survey of jailbreak methods from the
novel perspective of stealth. We find that existing attacks struggle to
simultaneously achieve toxic stealth (concealing toxic content) and linguistic
stealth (maintaining linguistic naturalness). Motivated by this, we propose
StegoAttack, a fully stealthy jailbreak attack that uses steganography to hide
the harmful query within benign, semantically coherent text. The attack then
prompts the LLM to extract the hidden query and respond in an encrypted manner.
This approach effectively hides malicious intent while preserving naturalness,
allowing it to evade both built-in and external safety mechanisms. We evaluate
StegoAttack on four safety-aligned LLMs from major providers, benchmarking
against eight state-of-the-art methods. StegoAttack achieves an average attack
success rate (ASR) of 92.00%, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11.0%.
Its ASR drops by less than 1% even under external detection (e.g., Llama
Guard). Moreover, it attains the optimal comprehensive scores on stealth
detection metrics, demonstrating both high efficacy and exceptional stealth
capabilities. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CoTSRF的新型LLM指纹识别方案，利用Chain of Thought（CoT）作为LLM的指纹，通过对比学习提取特征并进行验证，具有隐蔽性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大型语言模型（LLMs）易被滥用，现有指纹识别方法在隐蔽性和鲁棒性上表现不足。

Method: CoTSRF通过设计CoT查询收集LLM响应，利用对比学习训练提取器提取CoT特征，并通过Kullback-Leibler散度进行指纹验证。

Result: 实验证明CoTSRF在隐蔽性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoTSRF为LLM指纹识别提供了一种高效且隐蔽的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite providing superior performance, open-source large language models
(LLMs) are vulnerable to abusive usage. To address this issue, recent works
propose LLM fingerprinting methods to identify the specific source LLMs behind
suspect applications. However, these methods fail to provide stealthy and
robust fingerprint verification. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM
fingerprinting scheme, namely CoTSRF, which utilizes the Chain of Thought (CoT)
as the fingerprint of an LLM. CoTSRF first collects the responses from the
source LLM by querying it with crafted CoT queries. Then, it applies
contrastive learning to train a CoT extractor that extracts the CoT feature
(i.e., fingerprint) from the responses. Finally, CoTSRF conducts fingerprint
verification by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the CoT
features of the source and suspect LLMs against an empirical threshold. Various
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantage of our proposed
CoTSRF for fingerprinting LLMs, particularly in stealthy and robust fingerprint
verification.

*Viet Pham,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型安全威胁：通过操纵LLMs的系统提示，使其在特定目标问题上输出恶意答案，同时在其他问题上表现正常。作者开发了CAIN算法，能自动生成此类有害提示，并在开源和商业LLMs上验证了其攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs易受对抗攻击，但现有研究未关注通过系统提示操纵对话的攻击方式。这种攻击可能导致大规模信息操纵，危害LLMs的完整性。

Method: 开发CAIN算法，在无需访问LLM参数的黑盒设置下，自动生成针对特定问题的有害系统提示。

Result: CAIN在非目标攻击中使目标问题F1分数下降40%，在目标攻击中使特定有害回答的F1分数超过70%，同时对良性问题影响最小。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在系统提示操纵下的新安全风险，呼吁加强鲁棒性措施以保障LLMs在实际应用中的安全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also
known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a
novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs'
system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions
(e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"),
while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable
malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading
harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an
attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such
harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or
without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source
and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In
untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves
up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy
on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific
harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses
with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical
need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of
LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）通过恶意字体注入在外部资源（如网页）中的隐藏对抗提示漏洞，评估了两种攻击场景，并强调需加强LLM处理外部内容时的安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs具备实时网络搜索能力并与协议（如MCP）集成，可能引入新的安全漏洞，需系统研究其潜在风险。

Method: 通过恶意字体注入操纵代码到字形映射，在外部资源中注入隐形对抗提示，评估恶意内容中继和敏感数据泄漏两种攻击场景。

Result: 实验表明，间接提示结合恶意字体可绕过LLM安全机制，成功率因数据敏感性和提示设计而异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLM处理外部内容时加强安全措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly equipped with capabilities of
real-time web search and integrated with protocols like Model Context Protocol
(MCP). This extension could introduce new security vulnerabilities. We present
a systematic investigation of LLM vulnerabilities to hidden adversarial prompts
through malicious font injection in external resources like webpages, where
attackers manipulate code-to-glyph mapping to inject deceptive content which
are invisible to users. We evaluate two critical attack scenarios: (1)
"malicious content relay" and (2) "sensitive data leakage" through MCP-enabled
tools. Our experiments reveal that indirect prompts with injected malicious
font can bypass LLM safety mechanisms through external resources, achieving
varying success rates based on data sensitivity and prompt design. Our research
underscores the urgent need for enhanced security measures in LLM deployments
when processing external content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LALMs评估标准缺乏系统性分类，阻碍了模型的全面评估与发展。

Method: 通过全面调查，提出四维分类法：通用听觉感知与处理、知识与推理、对话导向能力、公平性与安全性。

Result: 提供了详细的分类概述，并指出了该领域的挑战与未来方向。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统化LALMs评估，为社区提供了明确指南，并将持续更新相关资源。

Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large
language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to
demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous
benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented
and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive
survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing
them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory
Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented
Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed
overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering
insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing
clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the
surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the
field.

TL;DR: Dysfluent-WFST是一种零样本解码器，可同时转录音素和检测言语不流畅，无需额外训练，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在临床应用中提供的信息有限，且文本无关模型在上下文相关情况下容易误分类。

Method: 引入Dysfluent-WFST，结合上游编码器（如WavLM），无需额外训练，显式建模发音行为。

Result: 在模拟和真实语音数据上，实现了音素错误率和言语不流畅检测的最优性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模发音行为比复杂架构更能提升言语不流畅处理系统的性能。

Abstract: Automatic detection of speech dysfluency aids speech-language pathologists in
efficient transcription of disordered speech, enhancing diagnostics and
treatment planning. Traditional methods, often limited to classification,
provide insufficient clinical insight, and text-independent models misclassify
dysfluency, especially in context-dependent cases. This work introduces
Dysfluent-WFST, a zero-shot decoder that simultaneously transcribes phonemes
and detects dysfluency. Unlike previous models, Dysfluent-WFST operates with
upstream encoders like WavLM and requires no additional training. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both phonetic error rate and dysfluency
detection on simulated and real speech data. Our approach is lightweight,
interpretable, and effective, demonstrating that explicit modeling of
pronunciation behavior in decoding, rather than complex architectures, is key
to improving dysfluency processing systems.

Motivation: 传统的精神分裂症评估方法将其简化为二元分类任务，忽略了症状的复杂性，降低了临床适用性。

Method: 开发了单模态模型和多模态框架，整合语音、视频和文本输入以估计症状严重程度。

Result: 该方法能够更详细地捕捉症状特征，提高诊断精度，支持个性化治疗。

Conclusion: 这种多模态方法为心理健康评估提供了可扩展且客观的工具，具有更高的临床实用性。

Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it
as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder,
oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This
traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its
practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to
individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that
integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each
modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By
capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable
and objective tool for mental health assessment.

Result: 在WSJ和LibriPhrase数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功减少了模态差异，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: For text enrollment-based open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), acoustic
and text embeddings are typically compared at either the phoneme or utterance
level. To facilitate this, we optimize acoustic and text encoders using deep
metric learning (DML), enabling direct comparison of multi-modal embeddings in
a shared embedding space. However, the inherent heterogeneity between audio and
text modalities presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Modality Adversarial Learning (MAL), which reduces the domain gap in
heterogeneous modality representations. Specifically, we train a modality
classifier adversarially to encourage both encoders to generate
modality-invariant embeddings. Additionally, we apply DML to achieve
phoneme-level alignment between audio and text, and conduct comprehensive
comparisons across various DML objectives. Experiments on the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) and LibriPhrase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: 该方法无需说话人标签或修改现有流程，能有效提升环境不匹配下的识别性能。

Abstract: A primary challenge when deploying speaker recognition systems in real-world
applications is performance degradation caused by environmental mismatch. We
propose a diffusion-based method that takes speaker embeddings extracted from a
pre-trained speaker recognition model and generates refined embeddings. For
training, our approach progressively adds Gaussian noise to both clean and
noisy speaker embeddings extracted from clean and noisy speech, respectively,
via forward process of a diffusion model, and then reconstructs them to clean
embeddings in the reverse process. While inferencing, all embeddings are
regenerated via diffusion process. Our method needs neither speaker label nor
any modification to the existing speaker recognition pipeline. Experiments on
evaluation sets simulating environment mismatch scenarios show that our method
can improve recognition accuracy by up to 19.6% over baseline models while
retaining performance on conventional scenarios. We publish our code here

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TFC的技术，首次在神经语音编解码器中引入可变帧率（VFR），以优化比特率和序列长度效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经语音编解码器使用恒定帧率（CFR），但语音段的信息密度随时间变化，CFR在比特率和序列长度上效率不佳。

Method: 提出TFC技术，通过动态调整帧率基于时间熵，实现可变帧率（VFR）。

Result: 实验表明，TFC在保持高质量重建的同时，具有高灵活性，且在低帧率下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: TFC技术有望与其他低帧率神经语音编解码器结合，提升下游任务效率。

Abstract: Most neural speech codecs achieve bitrate adjustment through intra-frame
mechanisms, such as codebook dropout, at a Constant Frame Rate (CFR). However,
speech segments inherently have time-varying information density (e.g., silent
intervals versus voiced regions). This property makes CFR not optimal in terms
of bitrate and token sequence length, hindering efficiency in real-time
applications. In this work, we propose a Temporally Flexible Coding (TFC)
technique, introducing variable frame rate (VFR) into neural speech codecs for
the first time. TFC enables seamlessly tunable average frame rates and
dynamically allocates frame rates based on temporal entropy. Experimental
results show that a codec with TFC achieves optimal reconstruction quality with
high flexibility, and maintains competitive performance even at lower frame
rates. Our approach is promising for the integration with other efforts to
develop low-frame-rate neural speech codecs for more efficient downstream
tasks.

Result: 在去噪、去混响和去削波等任务中表现优于现有基线，验证了主动调制的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE在复杂声学环境中展现出显著优势，为语音增强提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for active sound modification: Active Speech
Enhancement (ASE). While Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms focus on
suppressing external interference, ASE goes further by actively shaping the
speech signal -- both attenuating unwanted noise components and amplifying
speech-relevant frequencies -- to improve intelligibility and perceptual
quality. To enable this, we propose a novel Transformer-Mamba-based
architecture, along with a task-specific loss function designed to jointly
optimize interference suppression and signal enrichment. Our method outperforms
existing baselines across multiple speech processing tasks -- including
denoising, dereverberation, and declipping -- demonstrating the effectiveness
of active, targeted modulation in challenging acoustic environments.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在部分可观测性和复杂环境下决策困难，而人类驾驶员能通过常识推理做出最优决策。现有方法虽有效但部署不切实际且缺乏安全性分解。

Method: VERDI通过将视觉语言模型的推理过程与自动驾驶堆栈的中间模块输出对齐，在感知、预测和规划阶段嵌入结构化推理。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，VERDI比未嵌入推理的端到端方法性能提升10%（ℓ2距离），同时保持高推理速度。

Conclusion: VERDI成功将视觉语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到自动驾驶堆栈中，解决了现有方法的部署和安全性问题。

Abstract: While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under
partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of
commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information.
Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite
their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to
deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires
more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits
safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for
autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the
reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI
augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning
intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages
with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs.
By encouraging alignment in latent space, \textsc{VERDI} enables the modular AD
stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time
costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the
NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do
not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high
inference speed.

TL;DR: EasyInsert是一个利用相对姿态预测实现高精度插入任务的框架，具有强泛化能力和高效数据收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂环境中泛化能力差、依赖强假设（如CAD模型）的问题。

Method: 基于人类直觉（相对姿态足够），通过自动化数据收集训练模型，采用由粗到细的执行策略。

Result: 在零-shot实验中，对15种新物体中的13种达到90%以上成功率；仅需一次演示和4分钟数据即可对所有物体达到90%以上成功率。

Conclusion: EasyInsert在复杂环境中表现出色，泛化能力强且高效。

Abstract: Insertion task is highly challenging that requires robots to operate with
exceptional precision in cluttered environments. Existing methods often have
poor generalization capabilities. They typically function in restricted and
structured environments, and frequently fail when the plug and socket are far
apart, when the scene is densely cluttered, or when handling novel objects.
They also rely on strong assumptions such as access to CAD models or a digital
twin in simulation. To address this, we propose EasyInsert, a framework which
leverages the human intuition that relative pose (delta pose) between plug and
socket is sufficient for successful insertion, and employs efficient and
automated real-world data collection with minimal human labor to train a
generalizable model for relative pose prediction. During execution, EasyInsert
follows a coarse-to-fine execution procedure based on predicted delta pose, and
successfully performs various insertion tasks. EasyInsert demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization capability for unseen objects in cluttered
environments, handling cases with significant initial pose deviations while
maintaining high sample efficiency and requiring little human effort. In
real-world experiments, with just 5 hours of training data, EasyInsert achieves
over 90% success in zero-shot insertion for 13 out of 15 unseen novel objects,
including challenging objects like Type-C cables, HDMI cables, and Ethernet

automatically collected data for fine-tuning, it reaches over 90% success rate
for all 15 objects.

Motivation: 现有方法在机器人操作中存在空间理解不足的问题，3D点云模型缺乏语义抽象，而2D图像编码器难以进行空间推理。

Method: SEM框架通过空间增强器和机器人状态编码器，分别从3D几何上下文和图建模的关节依赖关系中增强空间理解。

Result: SEM在多种任务中表现优于现有基线，显著提升了操作的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SEM通过增强空间理解和机器人状态编码，为机器人操作提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with
strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object
relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point
cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with
spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced
Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly
enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial
enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a
robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased
modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly
improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable
manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: Manipulating elasto-plastic objects remains a significant challenge due to
severe self-occlusion, difficulties of representation, and complicated
dynamics. This work proposes a novel framework for elasto-plastic object
manipulation with a quasi-static assumption for motions, leveraging 3D
occupancy to represent such objects, a learned dynamics model trained with 3D
occupancy, and a learning-based predictive control algorithm to address these
challenges effectively. We build a novel data collection platform to collect
full spatial information and propose a pipeline for generating a 3D occupancy
dataset. To infer the 3D occupancy during manipulation, an occupancy prediction
network is trained with multiple RGB images supervised by the generated
dataset. We design a deep neural network empowered by a 3D convolution neural
network (CNN) and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the complex
deformation with the inferred 3D occupancy results. A learning-based predictive
control algorithm is introduced to plan the robot actions, incorporating a
novel shape-based action initialization module specifically designed to improve
the planner efficiency. The proposed framework in this paper can successfully
shape the elasto-plastic objects into a given goal shape and has been verified
in various experiments both in simulation and the real world.

TL;DR: VL-SAFE是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的安全强化学习框架，用于离线安全策略学习，通过世界模型生成安全评估，提升自动驾驶策略的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在自动驾驶中样本效率低、泛化能力差，且依赖在线交互，无法满足安全关键场景的需求。现有方法难以准确捕捉复杂驾驶环境中的安全语义。

Method: 构建离线数据集，利用VLM标注安全分数；训练世界模型生成虚拟轨迹和安全评估；基于这些数据，在VLM指导下进行actor-critic学习优化策略。

Result: VL-SAFE在样本效率、泛化能力、安全性和整体性能上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: VL-SAFE首次引入VLM指导的世界模型方法，为安全自动驾驶提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based autonomous driving policy learning faces
critical limitations such as low sample efficiency and poor generalization; its
reliance on online interactions and trial-and-error learning is especially
unacceptable in safety-critical scenarios. Existing methods including safe RL
often fail to capture the true semantic meaning of "safety" in complex driving
contexts, leading to either overly conservative driving behavior or constraint
violations. To address these challenges, we propose VL-SAFE, a world
model-based safe RL framework with Vision-Language model
(VLM)-as-safety-guidance paradigm, designed for offline safe policy learning.
Specifically, we construct offline datasets containing data collected by expert
agents and labeled with safety scores derived from VLMs. A world model is
trained to generate imagined rollouts together with safety estimations,
allowing the agent to perform safe planning without interacting with the real
environment. Based on these imagined trajectories and safety evaluations,
actor-critic learning is conducted under VLM-based safety guidance to optimize
the driving policy more safely and efficiently. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VL-SAFE achieves superior sample efficiency, generalization,
safety, and overall performance compared to existing baselines. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces a VLM-guided world
model-based approach for safe autonomous driving. The demo video and code can

TL;DR: Raw2Drive是一种基于双流模型强化学习（MBRL）的方法，用于解决端到端自动驾驶（E2E-AD）中强化学习（RL）训练困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习（IL）存在因果混淆和分布偏移问题，而RL可以缓解这些问题，但RL在E2E-AD中的应用仍具挑战性。

Method: 设计Raw2Drive，通过特权世界模型和原始传感器世界模型的结合，利用Guidance Mechanism确保两者一致性，并引导原始传感器策略的训练。

Result: Raw2Drive是CARLA Leaderboard 2.0和Bench2Drive上唯一基于RL的端到端方法，并取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: Raw2Drive填补了MBRL在原始传感器数据输入上的空白，为E2E-AD提供了一种有效的RL解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can mitigate the causal confusion and
distribution shift inherent to imitation learning (IL). However, applying RL to
end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training
difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and
industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated
promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require
privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap
by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently
train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that
uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor
world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures
consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model
during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior
knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively
guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL
based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: UAV-Flow框架实现了无人机对专家飞行轨迹的精确模仿，且无需模拟到现实的迁移，为语言交互无人机提供了新方向。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are evolving into language-interactive
platforms, enabling more intuitive forms of human-drone interaction. While
prior works have primarily focused on high-level planning and long-horizon
navigation, we shift attention to language-guided fine-grained trajectory
control, where UAVs execute short-range, reactive flight behaviors in response
to language instructions. We formalize this problem as the Flying-on-a-Word
(Flow) task and introduce UAV imitation learning as an effective approach. In
this framework, UAVs learn fine-grained control policies by mimicking expert
pilot trajectories paired with atomic language instructions. To support this
paradigm, we present UAV-Flow, the first real-world benchmark for
language-conditioned, fine-grained UAV control. It includes a task formulation,
a large-scale dataset collected in diverse environments, a deployable control
framework, and a simulation suite for systematic evaluation. Our design enables
UAVs to closely imitate the precise, expert-level flight trajectories of human
pilots and supports direct deployment without sim-to-real gap. We conduct
extensive experiments on UAV-Flow, benchmarking VLN and VLA paradigms. Results
show that VLA models are superior to VLN baselines and highlight the critical
role of spatial grounding in the fine-grained Flow setting.

Result: 实验表明，LLM驱动的ASP规则生成支持基于语义的决策，提供可解释的动态导航框架。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自动驾驶的适应性和可解释性，更贴近人类导航意图。

Abstract: Achieving full automation in self-driving vehicles remains a challenge,
especially in dynamic urban environments where navigation requires real-time
adaptability. Existing systems struggle to handle navigation plans when faced
with unpredictable changes in road layouts, spontaneous detours, or missing map
data, due to their heavy reliance on predefined cartographic information. In
this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models to generate Answer Set
Programming rules by translating informal navigation instructions into
structured, logic-based reasoning. ASP provides non-monotonic reasoning,
allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to evolving scenarios without relying on
predefined maps. We present an experimental evaluation in which LLMs generate
ASP constraints that encode real-world urban driving logic into a formal
knowledge representation. By automating the translation of informal navigation
instructions into logical rules, our method improves adaptability and
explainability in autonomous navigation. Results show that LLM-driven ASP rule
generation supports semantic-based decision-making, offering an explainable
framework for dynamic navigation planning that aligns closely with how humans
communicate navigational intent.

real-world trials across diverse initial conditions. Our findings pave the way
toward autonomous, perception-driven agricultural robots that intelligently

Abstract: Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery is currently fully manually
controlled by a trained surgeon. Automating this has great potential for
alleviating issues, e.g., physical strain, highly repetitive tasks, and
shortages of trained surgeons. For these reasons, recent works have utilized
Artificial Intelligence methods, which show promising adaptability. Despite
these advances, there is skepticism of these methods because they lack
explainability and robust safety guarantees. This paper presents a framework
for a safe, uncertainty-aware learning method. We train an Ensemble Model of
Diffusion Policies using expert demonstrations of needle insertion. Using an
Ensemble model, we can quantify the policy's epistemic uncertainty, which is
used to determine Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. This allows the system to
release control back to the surgeon in the event of an unsafe scenario.
Additionally, we implement a model-free Control Barrier Function to place
formal safety guarantees on the predicted action. We experimentally evaluate
our proposed framework using a state-of-the-art robotic suturing simulator. We
evaluate multiple scenarios, such as dropping the needle, moving the camera,
and moving the phantom. The learned policy is robust to these perturbations,
showing corrective behaviors and generalization, and it is possible to detect
Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. We further demonstrate that the Control Barrier
Function successfully limits the action to remain within our specified safety
set in the case of unsafe predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，泛化能力有限且难以适应域外（OOD）场景。

Method: 设计了两种基于规则的奖励函数：Affordance Perception Reward用于增强交互区域定位，Trajectory Match Reward用于确保动作路径的物理合理性。

Result: 通过直接优化任务对齐结果，减少了对标注数据的依赖，并提升了模型的泛化能力和物理推理能力。

Conclusion: ManipLVM-R1框架通过强化学习和可验证奖励，显著提升了机器人操作的适应性和系统性推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently advanced robotic
manipulation by leveraging vision for scene perception and language for
instruction following. However, existing methods rely heavily on costly
human-annotated training datasets, which limits their generalization and causes
them to struggle in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, reducing real-world
adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose ManipLVM-R1, a novel
reinforcement learning framework that replaces traditional supervision with
Reinforcement Learning using Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). By directly optimizing
for task-aligned outcomes, our method enhances generalization and physical
reasoning while removing the dependence on costly annotations. Specifically, we
design two rule-based reward functions targeting key robotic manipulation
subtasks: an Affordance Perception Reward to enhance localization of
interaction regions, and a Trajectory Match Reward to ensure the physical
plausibility of action paths. These rewards provide immediate feedback and
impose spatial-logical constraints, encouraging the model to go beyond shallow
pattern matching and instead learn deeper, more systematic reasoning about
physical interactions.

Method: CHROMA通过自监督学习在84,000个样本（约400万张染色体图像）上预训练，学习染色体异常的通用表示。

Result: CHROMA在各类异常中表现优于其他方法，即使标注数据较少或数据集不平衡。

Abstract: Chromosome analysis is vital for diagnosing genetic disorders and guiding
cancer therapy decisions through the identification of somatic clonal
aberrations. However, developing an AI model are hindered by the overwhelming
complexity and diversity of chromosomal abnormalities, requiring extensive
annotation efforts, while automated methods remain task-specific and lack
generalizability due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets spanning diverse
resource conditions. Here, we introduce CHROMA, a foundation model for
cytogenomics, designed to overcome these challenges by learning generalizable
representations of chromosomal abnormalities. Pre-trained on over 84,000
specimens (~4 million chromosomal images) via self-supervised learning, CHROMA
outperforms other methods across all types of abnormalities, even when trained
on fewer labelled data and more imbalanced datasets. By facilitating
comprehensive mapping of instability and clonal leisons across various
aberration types, CHROMA offers a scalable and generalizable solution for
reliable and automated clinical analysis, reducing the annotation workload for
experts and advancing precision oncology through the early detection of rare
genomic abnormalities, enabling broad clinical AI applications and making
advanced genomic analysis more accessible.

Abstract: Brain stroke remains one of the principal causes of death and disability
worldwide, yet most tabular-data prediction models still hover below the 95%
accuracy threshold, limiting real-world utility. Addressing this gap, the
present work develops and validates a completely data-driven and interpretable
machine-learning framework designed to predict strokes using ten routinely
gathered demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables sourced from a public
cohort of 4,981 records. We employ a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
to understand the dataset's structure and distribution, followed by rigorous
data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier removal, and
class imbalance correction using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
(SMOTE). To streamline feature selection, point-biserial correlation and
random-forest Gini importance were utilized, and ten varied
algorithms-encompassing tree ensembles, boosting, kernel methods, and a
multilayer neural network-were optimized using stratified five-fold
cross-validation. Their predictions based on probabilities helped us build the
proposed model, which included Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a
support-vector classifier, with logistic regression acting as a meta-learner.
The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.2% and an F1-score of
97.15%, indicating a significant enhancement compared to the leading individual
model, LightGBM, which had an accuracy of 91.4%. Our study's findings indicate
that rigorous preprocessing, coupled with a diverse hybrid model, can convert
low-cost tabular data into a nearly clinical-grade stroke-risk assessment tool.

Abstract: Materials are the foundation of modern society, underpinning advancements in

ability to discover and design new materials with tailored properties is
critical to solving some of the most pressing global challenges. In recent

materials and illustrate multiple representations of crystalline materials. We
then provide a detailed summary and taxonomy of current AI-driven materials

with potential future directions and challenges in this fast-growing field. The

Abstract: Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial forecasting,
traditionally approached by training models using the historical price data of
individual stocks. While these models effectively capture single-stock
patterns, they fail to leverage potential correlations among stock trends,
which could improve predictive performance. Current single-stock learning
methods are thus limited in their ability to provide a broader understanding of
price dynamics across multiple stocks. To address this, we propose a novel
method that merges local patterns into a global understanding through
cross-stock pattern integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning
(FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training. FL enables
collaborative learning across distributed datasets without sharing raw data,
facilitating the aggregation of global insights while preserving data privacy.
In our adaptation, we train models on individual stock data and iteratively
merge them to create a unified global model. This global model is subsequently
fine-tuned on specific stock data to retain local relevance. The proposed
strategy enables parallel training of individual stock models, facilitating
efficient utilization of computational resources and reducing overall training
time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method,
demonstrating that it outperforms benchmark models and enhances the predictive
capabilities of state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the efficacy
of Cross-Stock Trend Integration (CSTI) in advancing stock price prediction,
offering a robust alternative to traditional single-stock learning
methodologies.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，平台采用自我披露标识以增强透明度，但这些标识可能因依赖视觉提示而无效，尤其是对视障用户。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈（N=28，15名视障和13名非视障参与者），分析用户对AIG标识的交互体验。

Result: 研究发现用户多依赖内容标识（如标题、评论），而菜单辅助标识常被忽视；视障用户因界面元素不可访问性面临更大挑战。

Conclusion: 研究提出了改进AIG标识的设计建议，强调一致性和可访问性，以提升用户识别能力。

Abstract: AI-Generated (AIG) content has become increasingly widespread by recent
advances in generative models and the easy-to-use tools that have significantly
lowered the technical barriers for producing highly realistic audio, images,
and videos through simple natural language prompts. In response, platforms are
adopting provable provenance with platforms recommending AIG to be
self-disclosed and signaled to users. However, these indicators may be often
missed, especially when they rely solely on visual cues and make them
ineffective to users with different sensory abilities. To address the gap, we
conducted semi-structured interviews (N=28) with 15 sighted and 13 BLV
participants to examine their interaction with AIG content through
self-disclosed AI indicators. Our findings reveal diverse mental models and
practices, highlighting different strengths and weaknesses of content-based
(e.g., title, description) and menu-aided (e.g., AI labels) indicators. While
sighted participants leveraged visual and audio cues, BLV participants
primarily relied on audio and existing assistive tools, limiting their ability
to identify AIG. Across both groups, they frequently overlooked menu-aided
indicators deployed by platforms and rather interacted with content-based
indicators such as title and comments. We uncovered usability challenges
stemming from inconsistent indicator placement, unclear metadata, and cognitive
overload. These issues were especially critical for BLV individuals due to the
insufficient accessibility of interface elements. We provide practical
recommendations and design implications for future AIG indicators across
several dimensions.

Method: 开发了AI Puzzlers系统，基于ARC和多媒体学习理论，结合视觉和语言元素，通过参与式设计研究（21名儿童）验证效果。

Result: 研究提供了设计见解，揭示了儿童如何识别AI错误、制定应对策略及评估AI输出。

Conclusion: AI Puzzlers系统有效帮助儿童识别和分析genAI错误，为儿童AI教育工具设计提供了参考。

Abstract: The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) into everyday
life raises questions about the competencies required to critically engage with
these technologies. Unlike visual errors in genAI, textual mistakes are often
harder to detect and require specific domain knowledge. Furthermore, AI's
authoritative tone and structured responses can create an illusion of
correctness, leading to overtrust, especially among children. To address this,
we developed AI Puzzlers, an interactive system based on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC), to help children identify and analyze errors in genAI.
Drawing on Mayer & Moreno's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, AI
Puzzlers uses visual and verbal elements to reduce cognitive overload and
support error detection. Based on two participatory design sessions with 21
children (ages 6 - 11), our findings provide both design insights and an
empirical understanding of how children identify errors in genAI reasoning,
develop strategies for navigating these errors, and evaluate AI outputs.

TL;DR: 研究评估了结合智能手表和机器学习的移动健康干预（mHELP）对大学生压力的实时检测和自我管理的效果，发现能显著减少急性压力，但对慢性症状如抑郁效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大学生面临心理健康问题但传统医疗资源有限，需探索移动健康工具的潜力。

Method: 12周随机对照试验，比较使用完整mHELP干预组与仅记录压力的对照组，通过生理和自评指标分析效果。

Result: 干预组在客观压力指标（MS）上显著降低，但主观焦虑、抑郁评分无显著差异，仅焦虑和压力评分有临床意义下降。

Conclusion: 可穿戴移动健康工具对减少急性压力有效，但需进一步优化以应对慢性症状。

Abstract: College students are increasingly affected by stress, anxiety, and
depression, yet face barriers to traditional mental health care. This study
evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health
Evaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor
and machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and
self-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117),
participants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of
interventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress
logging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, "Moments of
Stress" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and
analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly,
secondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also
analyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a
substantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control
group, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective
scores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the
treatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS
scores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth
tools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for
extended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like
depression.

TL;DR: SpecMaskFoley通过ControlNet改进预训练的SpecMaskGIT模型，用于视频同步的Foley合成，性能优于从头训练的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet方法在Foley合成中表现不佳，而从头训练模型虽有效但复杂。研究旨在缩小两者性能差距。

Method: 提出SpecMaskFoley，利用频率感知时间特征对齐器解决视频特征与SpecMaskGIT时间频率特性的不匹配问题。

Result: 在Foley合成基准测试中，SpecMaskFoley性能优于从头训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: SpecMaskFoley显著推动了基于ControlNet的Foley合成模型的发展。

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both
semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad
application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in
the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio
generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for
video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction.
ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative
models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to
handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch
models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted
using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between
ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose
SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward
video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a
single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video
features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a
frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated
conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common
foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform
strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of
ControlNet-based foley synthesis models. Demo page:

TL;DR: AudioTrust是首个针对音频大语言模型（ALLMs）的多维度可信度评估框架和基准，覆盖公平性、幻觉、安全性、隐私、鲁棒性和认证六个维度，通过18种实验设置和4,420个音频/文本样本进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注文本模态或有限的安全维度，未能充分反映音频模态的独特性和应用场景，因此需要系统研究ALLMs的可信度。

Method: AudioTrust设计了18种实验设置和9种音频特定评估指标，使用大规模自动化管道对模型输出进行客观评分。

Result: 实验揭示了当前开源和闭源ALLMs在高风险音频场景中的可信度边界和局限性。

Conclusion: AudioTrust为未来音频模型的安全和可信部署提供了宝贵见解，平台和基准已开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language
Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness.
However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly
concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored.
Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address
only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for
the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio
modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness
evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust
facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination,
safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate
these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental
setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text
samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency
calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the
multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully
designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale
automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs.
Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of
current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted
with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the
secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and
benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.

Abstract: This paper presents <Dialogue in Resonance>, an interactive music piece for a
human pianist and a computer-controlled piano that integrates real-time
automatic music transcription into a score-driven framework. Unlike previous
approaches that primarily focus on improvisation-based interactions, our work
establishes a balanced framework that combines composed structure with dynamic
interaction. Through real-time automatic transcription as its core mechanism,
the computer interprets and responds to the human performer's input in real
time, creating a musical dialogue that balances compositional intent with live
interaction while incorporating elements of unpredictability. In this paper, we
present the development process from composition to premiere performance,
including technical implementation, rehearsal process, and performance
considerations.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models for music information retrieval based on
self-supervised learning (SSL) are becoming popular, showing success in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited research on the specific meanings
of the encoded information and their applicability. Exploring these aspects can
help us better understand their capabilities and limitations, leading to more
effective use in downstream tasks.
  In this study, we analyze the advanced music representation model MusicFM and
the newly emerged SSL model MuQ. We focus on three main aspects: (i) validating
the advantages of SSL models across multiple downstream tasks, (ii) exploring
the specialization of layer-wise information for different tasks, and (iii)
comparing performance differences when selecting specific layers. Through this
analysis, we reveal insights into the structure and potential applications of
SSL models in music information retrieval.

Result: 模型在零样本跨语言场景中表现优异，即使对于未见过的语言也能有效工作。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需多编码器即可实现语音特征的解耦，适用于零样本跨语言语音转换。

Abstract: Voice Conversion research in recent times has increasingly focused on
improving the zero-shot capabilities of existing methods. Despite remarkable
advancements, current architectures still tend to struggle in zero-shot
cross-lingual settings. They are also often unable to generalize for speakers
of unseen languages and accents. In this paper, we adopt a simple yet effective
approach that combines discrete speech representations from self-supervised
models with a non-autoregressive Diffusion-Transformer based conditional flow
matching speech decoder. We show that this architecture allows us to train a
voice-conversion model in a purely textless, self-supervised fashion. Our
technique works without requiring multiple encoders to disentangle speech
features. Our model also manages to excel in zero-shot cross-lingual settings
even for unseen languages.

Abstract: Transactions are an important aspect of human social life, and represent
dynamic flow of information, intangible values, such as trust, as well as
monetary and social capital. Although much research has been conducted on the
nature of transactions in fields ranging from the social sciences to game
theory, the systemic effects of different types of agents transacting in
real-world social networks (often following a scale-free distribution) are not
fully understood. A particular systemic measure that has not received adequate
attention in the complex networks and game theory communities, is the Gini
Coefficient, which is widely used in economics to quantify and understand
wealth inequality. In part, the problem is a lack of experimentation using a
replicable algorithm and publicly available data. Motivated by this problem,
this article proposes a model and simulation algorithm, based on game theory,
for quantifying the evolution of inequality in complex networks of strategic
agents. Our results shed light on several complex drivers of inequality, even
in simple, abstract settings, and exhibit consistency across networks with
different origins and descriptions.
